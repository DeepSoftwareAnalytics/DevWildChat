Also you need to know about the function(s) you are calling, in this case I googled for a description of the functions inside cards.dll, I use 2: and .\n\nCreate a new Widgets app, first insert in your .pro file to turn on C++11 features, then goto your mainwindow.cpp, insert these includes:\n\n @\n\n #include \"QLibrary\"\n\n #include \"QTimer\"\n\n #include \"windows.h\"\n\n @\n\nthen below ui->setupUi(this); insert this fancy code:\n\n @\n\n ((int (WINAPI*)(int*,int*)) QLibrary(\"C:/Downloads/cards.dll\").resolve(\"cdtInit\"))(new int, new int);\n\n QTimer* pTimer = new QTimer(this);\n\n pTimer->start(500);\n\n connect(pTimer,&QTimer::timeout,\n\n {\n\n auto GetDC = (int (WINAPI *)(int)) QLibrary(\"user32.dll\").resolve(\"GetDC\");\n\n auto cdtDraw = (int (WINAPI *)(int,int,int,int,int,int)) QLibrary(\"C:/Downloads/cards.dll\").resolve(\"cdtDraw\");\n\n cdtDraw(GetDC(0),rand() % 1000,rand() % 1000,rand() % 52,0,0);\n\n });\n\n @\n\nIf you do it right you'll get lots of cards drawn on your screen like this: !http://www.tripleboot.org/Pictures/DLLTest.png(Lots of cards)!"

But whatever Qt Creator is doing it can be done manually but you will have to read the documentation carefully.

Now i added this path of the lib file in my test1.pro file in the following way....\n• Then your push button should be connected to a signal of your dialog. your dialog is exported so you can connect to it from outside the lib. The push button is not accessible from outside. This is a normal C++ issue, hide members from being used from outside of the class.
