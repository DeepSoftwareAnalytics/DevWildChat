        "document": "The root interface in the. A collection represents a group of objects, known as its. Some collections allow duplicate elements and others do not. Some are ordered and others unordered. The JDK does not provide anyimplementations of this interface: it provides implementations of more specific subinterfaces likeand. This interface is typically used to pass collections around and manipulate them where maximum generality is desired.\n\nBags or multisets (unordered collections that may contain duplicate elements) should implement this interface directly.\n\nAll general-purpose implementation classes (which typically implement indirectly through one of its subinterfaces) should provide two \"standard\" constructors: a void (no arguments) constructor, which creates an empty collection, and a constructor with a single argument of type , which creates a new collection with the same elements as its argument. In effect, the latter constructor allows the user to copy any collection, producing an equivalent collection of the desired implementation type. There is no way to enforce this convention (as interfaces cannot contain constructors) but all of the general-purpose implementations in the Java platform libraries comply.\n\nThe \"destructive\" methods contained in this interface, that is, the methods that modify the collection on which they operate, are specified to throw if this collection does not support the operation. If this is the case, these methods may, but are not required to, throw an if the invocation would have no effect on the collection. For example, invoking the method on an unmodifiable collection may, but is not required to, throw the exception if the collection to be added is empty.\n\nSome collection implementations have restrictions on the elements that they may contain. For example, some implementations prohibit null elements, and some have restrictions on the types of their elements. Attempting to add an ineligible element throws an unchecked exception, typically or . Attempting to query the presence of an ineligible element may throw an exception, or it may simply return false; some implementations will exhibit the former behavior and some will exhibit the latter. More generally, attempting an operation on an ineligible element whose completion would not result in the insertion of an ineligible element into the collection may throw an exception or it may succeed, at the option of the implementation. Such exceptions are marked as \"optional\" in the specification for this interface.\n\nIt is up to each collection to determine its own synchronization policy. In the absence of a stronger guarantee by the implementation, undefined behavior may result from the invocation of any method on a collection that is being mutated by another thread; this includes direct invocations, passing the collection to a method that might perform invocations, and using an existing iterator to examine the collection.\n\nMany methods in Collections Framework interfaces are defined in terms of the method. For example, the specification for the method says: \"returns if and only if this collection contains at least one element such that .\" This specification should not be construed to imply that invoking with a non-null argument will cause to be invoked for any element . Implementations are free to implement optimizations whereby the invocation is avoided, for example, by first comparing the hash codes of the two elements. (The specification guarantees that two objects with unequal hash codes cannot be equal.) More generally, implementations of the various Collections Framework interfaces are free to take advantage of the specified behavior of underlying methods wherever the implementor deems it appropriate.\n\nSome collection operations which perform recursive traversal of the collection may fail with an exception for self-referential instances where the collection directly or indirectly contains itself. This includes the , , and methods. Implementations may optionally handle the self-referential scenario, however most current implementations do not do so.\n\nThis interface is a member of the Java Collections Framework."

        "document": "The Collection interface in Java is a core member of the Java Collections Framework located in the java.util package. It is one of the root interfaces of the Java Collection Hierarchy. The Collection interface is not directly implemented by any class. Instead, it is implemented indirectly through its sub-interfaces like List, Queue, and Set.\n\nFor Example, the ArrayList class implements the List interface, a sub-interface of the Collection interface.\n\nHere, E represents the type of elements stored in the collection.\n\nNote: In the above syntax, we can replace any class with ArrayList if that class implements the Collection interface.\n\nThe Collection interface is part of a hierarchy that extends Iterable, means collections can be traversed.\n\nThe hierarchy also includes several key sub-interfaces:\n\nThe subInterfaces are sometimes called as Collection Types or SubTypes of Collection. These include the following:\n\nThe List interface represents an ordered collection that allows duplicates. It is implemented by classes like ArrayList, LinkedList, and Vector. Lists allow elements to be accessed by their index position.\n\nA set is an unordered collection of objects in which duplicate values cannot be stored. This set interface is implemented by various classes like HashSet, TreeSet, LinkedHashSet, etc.\n\nThis interface is very similar to the set interface. The only difference is that this interface has extra methods that maintain the ordering of the elements. The sorted set interface extends the set interface and is used to handle the data which needs to be sorted. The class which implements this interface is TreeSet.\n\nThe Queue interface represents a collection that follows FIFO (First-In-First-Out) order. It is implemented by classes like PriorityQueue, Deque, ArrayDeque, etc.\n\nThe Deque interface extends Queue and allows elements to be added or removed from both ends of the queue. It is implemented by ArrayDeque and LinkedList.\n\nThe NavigableSet interface extends SortedSet and provides additional methods for navigation such as finding the closest element.\n\nNote: The Collection Interface is not limited to the above classes, there are many more classes.\n\nEnsures that this collection contains the specified element (optional operation). Adds all the elements in the specified collection to this collection (optional operation). Removes all the elements from this collection (optional operation). Returns true if this collection contains the specified element. Returns true if this collection contains all the elements in the specified collection. Compares the specified object with this collection for equality. Returns the hash code value for this collection. Returns true if this collection contains no elements. Returns an iterator over the elements in this collection. Returns a possibly parallel Stream with this collection as its source. Removes a single instance of the specified element from this collection, if it is present (optional operation). Removes all of this collection’s elements that are also contained in the specified collection (optional operation). Removes all the elements of this collection that satisfy the given predicate. Retains only the elements in this collection that are contained in the specified collection (optional operation). Returns the number of elements in this collection. Creates a Spliterator over the elements in this collection. Returns a sequential Stream with this collection as its source. Returns an array containing all the elements in this collection. Returns an array containing all the elements in this collection, using the provided generator function to allocate the returned array. Returns an array containing all the elements in this collection; the runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array.\n\nThe add(E e) and addAll(Collection c) methods provided by Collection can be used to add elements.\n\nThe remove(E e) and removeAll(Collection c) methods can be used to remove a particular element or a Collection of elements from a collection.\n\nTo iterate over the elements of Collection we can use iterator() method."

        "document": "Java Collections Framework is one of the core parts of the Java programming language. Collections are used in almost every programming language. Most of the programming languages support various type of collections such as List, Set, Queue, Stack, etc.\n\nCollections are like containers that group multiple items in a single unit. For example, a jar of chocolates, a list of names, etc.\n\nCollections are used in every programming language and when Java arrived, it also came with few Collection classes – Vector, Stack, Hashtable, Array.\n\nJava 1.2 provided Collections Framework that is the architecture to represent and manipulate Collections in java in a standard way. Java Collections Framework consists of the following parts:\n\nJava Collections Framework interfaces provides the abstract data type to represent collection.\n\njava.util.Collection is the root interface of Collections Framework. It is on the top of the Collections framework hierarchy. It contains some important methods such as size(), iterator(), add(), remove(), clear() that every Collection class must implement.\n\nSome other important interfaces are java.util.List, java.util.Set, java.util.Queue and java.util.Map. The Map is the only interface that doesn’t inherit from the Collection interface but it’s part of the Collections framework. All the collections framework interfaces are present in java.util package.\n\nJava Collections framework provides implementation classes for core collection interfaces. We can use them to create different types of collections in the Java program.\n\nSome important collection classes are ArrayList, LinkedList, HashMap, TreeMap, HashSet, and TreeSet. These classes solve most of our programming needs but if we need some special collection class, we can extend them to create our custom collection class.\n\nJava 1.5 came up with thread-safe collection classes that allowed us to modify Collections while iterating over them. Some of them are CopyOnWriteArrayList, ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArraySet. These classes are in java.util.concurrent package.\n\nAll the collection classes are present in java.util and java.util.concurrent package.\n\nAlgorithms are useful methods to provide some common functionalities such as searching, sorting and shuffling.\n\nBelow class diagram shows Collections Framework hierarchy. For simplicity, I have included only commonly used interfaces and classes.\n• Reduced Development Effort – It comes with almost all common types of collections and useful methods to iterate and manipulate the data. So we can concentrate more on business logic rather than designing our collection APIs.\n• Better Quality – Using core collection classes that are well-tested increases our program quality rather than using any home-developed data structure.\n• Reduce effort to maintain because everybody knows Collection API classes.\n\nJava collection interfaces are the foundation of the Java Collections Framework. Note that all the core collection interfaces are generic; for example public interface Collection<E>. The <E> syntax is for Generics and when we declare Collection, we should use it to specify the type of Object it can contain. It helps in reducing run-time errors by type-checking the Objects at compile-time.\n\nTo keep the number of core collection interfaces manageable, the Java platform doesn’t provide separate interfaces for each variant of each collection type. If an unsupported operation is invoked, a collection implementation throws an UnsupportedOperationException.\n\nThis is the root of the collection hierarchy. A collection represents a group of objects known as its elements. The Java platform doesn’t provide any direct implementations of this interface.\n\nThe interface has methods to tell you how many elements are in the collection (size, isEmpty), to check whether a given object is in the collection (contains), to add and remove an element from the collection (add, remove), and to provide an iterator over the collection (iterator).\n\nCollection interface also provides bulk operations methods that work on the entire collection – containsAll, addAll, removeAll, retainAll, clear.\n\nThe toArray methods are provided as a bridge between collections and older APIs that expect arrays on input.\n\nIterator interface provides methods to iterate over the elements of the Collection. We can get the instance of iterator using method. Iterator takes the place of in the Java Collections Framework. Iterators allow the caller to remove elements from the underlying collection during the iteration. Iterators in collection classes implement Iterator Design Pattern.\n\nSet is a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements. This interface models the mathematical set abstraction and is used to represent sets, such as the deck of cards.\n\nThe Java platform contains three general-purpose Set implementations: , , and . Set interface doesn’t allow random-access to an element in the Collection. You can use iterator or foreach loop to traverse the elements of a Set.\n\nList is an ordered collection and can contain duplicate elements. You can access any element from its index. List is more like array with dynamic length. List is one of the most used Collection type. and are implementation classes of List interface.\n\nList interface provides useful methods to add an element at a specific index, remove/replace element based on the index and to get a sub-list using the index.\n\nCollections class provide some useful algorithm for List – sort, shuffle, reverse, binarySearch etc.\n\nQueue is a collection used to hold multiple elements prior to processing. Besides basic Collection operations, a Queue provides additional insertion, extraction, and inspection operations.\n\nQueues typically, but do not necessarily, order elements in a FIFO (first-in-first-out) manner. Among the exceptions are priority queues, which order elements according to a supplied comparator or the elements’ natural ordering. Whatever the ordering used, the head of the queue is the element that would be removed by a call to remove or poll. In a FIFO queue, all new elements are inserted at the tail of the queue.\n\nA linear collection that supports element insertion and removal at both ends. The name deque is short for “double-ended queue” and is usually pronounced “deck”. Most Deque implementations place no fixed limits on the number of elements they may contain, but this interface supports capacity-restricted deques as well as those with no fixed size limit.\n\nThis interface defines methods to access the elements at both ends of the deque. Methods are provided to insert, remove, and examine the element.\n\nJava Map is an object that maps keys to values. A map cannot contain duplicate keys: Each key can map to at most one value.\n\nThe Java platform contains three general-purpose Map implementations: HashMap, TreeMap, and LinkedHashMap.\n\nThe basic operations of Map are put, get, containsKey, containsValue, size, and isEmpty.\n\nAn iterator for lists that allows the programmer to traverse the list in either direction, modify the list during iteration, and obtain the iterator’s current position in the list.\n\nJava ListIterator has no current element; its cursor position always lies between the element that would be returned by a call to previous() and the element that would be returned by a call to next().\n\nSortedSet is a Set that maintains its elements in ascending order. Several additional operations are provided to take advantage of the ordering. Sorted sets are used for naturally ordered sets, such as word lists and membership rolls.\n\nA map that maintains its mappings in ascending key order. This is the Map analog of SortedSet. Sorted maps are used for naturally ordered collections of key/value pairs, such as dictionaries and telephone directories.\n\nJava Collections framework comes with many implementation classes for the interfaces. Most common implementations are ArrayList, HashMap and HashSet. Java 1.5 included Concurrent implementations; for example ConcurrentHashMap and CopyOnWriteArrayList. Usually Collection classes are not thread-safe and their iterator is fail-fast. In this section, we will learn about commonly used collection classes.\n\nJava HashSet is the basic implementation the Set interface that is backed by a HashMap. It makes no guarantees for iteration order of the set and permits the null element.\n\nThis class offers constant time performance for basic operations ( , , and ), assuming the hash function disperses the elements properly among the buckets. We can set the initial capacity and load factor for this collection. The load factor is a measure of how full the hash map is allowed to get before its capacity is automatically increased.\n\nA implementation based on a . The elements are ordered using their natural ordering, or by a provided at set creation time, depending on which constructor is used.\n\nThis implementation provides guaranteed log(n) time cost for the basic operations (add, remove, and contains).\n\nNote that the ordering maintained by a set (whether or not an explicit comparator is provided) must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the Set interface. (See Comparable or Comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals.) This is so because the Set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation, but a TreeSet instance performs all element comparisons using its compareTo (or compare) method, so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are, from the standpoint of the set, equal.\n\nJava ArrayList is the resizable-array implementation of the List interface. Implements all optional list operations, and permits all elements, including null. In addition to implementing the List interface, this class provides methods to manipulate the size of the array that is used internally to store the list. (This class is roughly equivalent to Vector, except that it is unsynchronized.)\n\nThe size, isEmpty, get, set, iterator, and list iterator operations run in constant time. The add operation runs in amortized constant time, that is, adding n elements requires O(n) time. All of the other operations run in linear time (roughly speaking). The constant factor is low compared to that for the LinkedList implementation.\n\nDoubly-linked list implementation of the List and Deque interfaces. Implements all optional list operations, and permits all elements (including null).\n\nAll of the operations perform as expected for a doubly-linked list. Operations that index into the list will traverse the list from the start or the end, whichever is closer to the specified index.\n\nHash table based implementation of the Map interface. This implementation provides all of the optional map operations and permits null values and the null key. HashMap class is roughly equivalent to Hashtable, except that it is unsynchronized and permits null. This class makes no guarantees for the order of the map.\n\nThis implementation provides constant-time performance for the basic operations ( and ). It provides constructors to set initial capacity and load factor for the collection.\n\nA Red-Black tree based NavigableMap implementation. The map is sorted according to the natural ordering of its keys, or by a Comparator provided at map creation time, depending on which constructor is used.\n\nThis implementation provides guaranteed log(n) time cost for the containsKey, get, put, and remove operations. Algorithms are adaptations of those in Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest’s Introduction to Algorithms.\n\nNote that the ordering maintained by a TreeMap, like any sorted map, and whether or not an explicit comparator is provided, must be consistent with equals if this sorted map is to correctly implement the Map interface. (See Comparable or Comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals.) This is so because the Map interface is defined in terms of the equals operation, but a sorted map performs all key comparisons using its compareTo (or compare) method, so two keys that are deemed equal by this method are, from the standpoint of the sorted map, equal. The behavior of a sorted map is well-defined even if its ordering is inconsistent with equals; it just fails to obey the general contract of the Map interface.\n\nQueue processes its elements in FIFO order but sometimes we want elements to be processed based on their priority. We can use PriorityQueue in this case and we need to provide a Comparator implementation while instantiation the PriorityQueue. PriorityQueue doesn’t allow null values and it’s unbounded. For more details about this, please head over to Java Priority Queue where you can check its usage with a sample program.\n\nJava Collections class consists exclusively of static methods that operate on or return collections. It contains polymorphic algorithms that operate on collections, “wrappers”, which return a new collection backed by a specified collection, and a few other odds and ends.\n\nThis class contains methods for collection framework algorithms, such as binary search, sorting, shuffling, reverse, etc.\n\nThe synchronization wrappers add automatic synchronization (thread-safety) to an arbitrary collection. Each of the six core collection interfaces — Collection, Set, List, Map, SortedSet, and SortedMap — has one static factory method.\n\nEach of these methods returns a synchronized (thread-safe) Collection backed up by the specified collection.\n\nUnmodifiable wrappers take away the ability to modify the collection by intercepting all the operations that would modify the collection and throwing an . Its main usage are;\n• To make a collection immutable once it has been built. In this case, it’s good practice not to maintain a reference to the backing collection. This absolutely guarantees immutability.\n• To allow certain clients read-only access to your data structures. You keep a reference to the backing collection but hand out a reference to the wrapper. In this way, clients can look but not modify, while you maintain full access.\n\nJava 1.5 Concurrent package ( ) contains thread-safe collection classes that allow collections to be modified while iterating. By design, an iterator is fail-fast and throws ConcurrentModificationException. Some of these classes are , , .\n\nJava Collections Framework provides algorithm implementations that are commonly used such as sorting and searching. Collections class contain these method implementations. Most of these algorithms work on List but some of them are applicable for all kinds of collections.\n\nThe sort algorithm reorders a List so that its elements are in ascending order according to an ordering relationship. Two forms of the operation are provided. The simple form takes a List and sorts it according to its elements’ natural ordering. The second form of the sort takes a Comparator in addition to a List and sorts the elements with the Comparator.\n\nThe shuffle algorithm destroys any trace of order that may have been present in a List. That is, this algorithm reorders the List based on input from a source of randomness such that all possible permutations occur with equal likelihood, assuming a fair source of randomness. This algorithm is useful in implementing games of chance.\n\nThe binarySearch algorithm searches for a specified element in a sorted list. This algorithm has two forms. The first takes a List and an element to search for (the “search key”).\n\nThis form assumes that the list is sorted in ascending order according to the natural ordering of its elements.\n\nThe second form takes a Comparator in addition to the List and the search key and assumes that the list is sorted into ascending order according to the specified Comparator.\n\nThe sort algorithm can be used to sort the List prior to calling binarySearch.\n\nThe frequency and disjoint algorithms test some aspect of the composition of one or more Collections.\n• frequency: counts the number of times the specified element occurs in the specified collection\n• disjoint: determines whether two Collections are disjoint; that is, whether they contain no elements in common\n\nThe min and the max algorithms return, respectively, the minimum and maximum element contained in a specified Collection. Both of these operations come in two forms. The simple form takes only a Collection and returns the minimum (or maximum) element according to the elements’ natural ordering.\n\nJava 8 biggest changes are related to Collection APIs. Some of the important changes and improvements are:\n• Introduction of Stream API for sequential as well as parallel processing, you should read Java Stream API Tutorial for more details.\n• Iterable interface has been extended with forEach() default method for iterating over a collection.\n• Lambda Expression and Functional interfaces are mostly beneficial with Collection API classes.\n• Collectors class gets various methods for collecting unmodifiable collections (Set, List, Map). These method names are toUnmodifiableList, toUnmodifiableSet, and toUnmodifiableMap.\n\nLet’s look at an example of these new Java 10 Collections API methods usage.\n\nA new default method added in the Collection interface. This method returns an array containing all of the elements in this collection, using the provided generator function to allocate the returned array.\n\nBelow table provides basic details of commonly used collection classes.\n\nI hope this tutorial explained most of the topics in the Java collections framework. Please share your opinion with comments."

I've searched on the internet for quite a while now, but couldn't find a similar question.\n\n I need to write a Java program that reads commands from the console, validates the input, gets the parameters and passes them on to a different class.\n\n There are some restrictions on what I can do and use (university).\n• Only the packages java.util, java.lang and java.io are allowed\n• Each method can only be 80 lines long\n• Each line can only be 120 characters long\n• I am not allowed to use System.exit / Runtime.exit\n• The Terminal class is used to handle user input. will read a line from the console, like\n\nI have a fully working program - however my solution will not be accepted because of the way I handle console inputs ( method too long). I'm doing it like this:\n• None The main class has the main method and an \"interaction loop\" where console inputs are handled. The main method calls the interaction loop in a while loop, with a boolean \"quit\" as a guardian.\n• None The interaction loop handles console input. I need to check for 16 different commands - each with their own types of parameters. I chose to work with Patterns and Matchers, because I can use the groups for convenience. Now the problems start - I have never learned how to correctly handle user inputs. What I have done here is, for each possible command, create a new Matcher, see if the input matches, if it does then do whatever needs to be done for this input. private static runInteractionLoop() { Matcher m; String query = Terminal.readLine; m = Pattern.compile(\"sliding-window (\\\\d+) (-?\\\\d+(?:\\\\.\\\\d+)?;)*(-?\\\\d+(?:\\\\.\\\\d+)?)\").matcher(query); if (m.matches()) { xyz.doSth(Integer.parseInt(m.group(1)), ......); ... return; } m = Pattern.compile(\"record ([a-z]+) (-?\\\\d+(?:\\\\.\\\\d+)?)\").matcher(query); if (m.matches()) { xyz.doSthElse(m.group(1), Double.parseDouble(m.group(2))); return; } ... if (query.equals(\"quit\")) { quit = true; return; } Terminal.printError(\"invalid input\"); }\n\nAs you can see, doing this 16 times stretches out the method to more than 80 lines (5 lines per input max). It's also obviously very inefficient and to be honest, I'm quite ashamed to be posting this here (crap code). I just don't know how to do this correctly, using only java.util and having some way to quickly get the parameters (e.g. the Matcher groups here).\n\n\n\n Any ideas? I would be very grateful for suggestions. Thanks.\n\nEDIT/UPDATE:\n\n I have made the decision to split the verification into two methods - one for each half of the commands. Looks ugly, but passes the Uni's checkstyle requirements. However, I'd still be more than happy if someone shows me a better solution to my problem - for the future (because I obviously have no idea how to make this prettier, shorter and/or more efficient)."
