You can use the function of module allows you to split a string based on multiple delimiters specified by a regular expression pattern. This can be incredibly useful when you need more complex or flexible splitting logic than what is provided by the built-in method of strings. str.split() method that is commonly used to split a string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter.\n\nYou can split a string on multiple delimiters in Python using many ways, for example, by using the , , , & , , and ) functions. In this article, I will explain how to split a string on multiple delimiters by using all these methods with examples.\n\n1. Quick Examples of Splitting String Over the Multiple Delimiters\n\nIf you are in a hurry, below are some quick examples of how to split the string on multiple delimiters.\n\n2. Using the re module Split the String Based on Multiple Delimiters\n\nYou can use some of the functions of the Python module(Regular Expressions) to split the strings based on multiple delimiters.\n\nThe function is one of the functions of module which is used to split a string over the multiple delimiters along with the defined pattern. This pattern matches any comma( ) , semicolon( ) , or pipe( character in the input string.\n\nIf you want to work with Regular Expressions you need to import module. First, initialize a string with the value and define a regular expression pattern . Pass the string and pattern into split() function.\n\nThis function returns a list of substrings. You print the result, which should be a list of substrings after splitting the original string using the specified delimiters.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the function of re-module to split a string over the multiple delimiters. It looks like you have a string that you want to split based on delimiters such as comma ( ), underscore ( ), hyphen( ), and exclamation mark ( ).\n\nIn the below example, first, you import the module for regular expressions. You can initialize a string with the value . You can use the function with a regular expression pattern to split the string on the specified delimiters. The pipe( ) character is used as an “OR” operator in the regular expression, allowing you to match any of the delimiters. This function returns a list of substrings. You print the result, which should be the list of substrings after splitting the original string using the specified delimiters.\n\nSimilarly, you can use the function with a regular expression to split a string using multiple delimiters. This expression matches one or more word characters or apostrophes, effectively splitting the string at non-alphanumeric characters.\n\nIn the below example, you import the module for regular expressions. You can initialize a string with the value . You can use this function with the regular expression pattern to find and extract substrings that consist of one or more word characters or apostrophes. You print the result, which should be a list of substrings after splitting the original string using the specified delimiters.\n\nYou can also use custom logic to split the string over multiple delimiters. Here’s an example using a nested for loop to split the string over the multiple delimiters. First, initialize a string, a list of delimiters, and then use custom logic to split the string using each delimiter. The result is a list of split parts, where each part represents a segment of the original string separated by the specified delimiters.\n\nYields the same output as above.\n\nYou can also use the split() function to split the string based on multiple delimiters using. It involves using a loop to iterate through the delimiters and then repeatedly splitting and joining the string. Finally, you split the resulting string to get the individual parts.\n\nYields the same output as above.\n\nYou can also use the method in combination with to replace multiple characters with a common delimiter and then split the resulting string using the split() method.\n\nIn the below example, you define the original string. You define a string of delimiters that you want to replace with spaces. You use to create a translation table that maps each delimiter character to a space character of the same length. You use the method to replace the delimiters with spaces in the original string, creating the . You split the modified_string using the method to obtain the desired list of substrings.\n\nYields the same output as above.\n\n6. Split The String on Multiple Delimiters Using replace() Method\n\nFinally, You can split the string by multiple characters using the str.replace() method with to handle a series of delimiters. For example, first, define the original string and a list of delimiters that you want to replace with spaces. You can iterate through each delimiter in the list and use str.replace() function to replace them with spaces in the original string. You split the modified string using the split() method to obtain the desired list of substrings\n\nYields the same output as above.\n\nIn this article, I have explained how to split a string based on multiple delimiters in Python by using , , , & , , and functions with examples.\n• Get First and Last Elements of Deque in Python\n• Get substring of a string in Python"

        "document": "When working with text data in Python, you’ll often need to break strings apart using multiple separators. Whether you’re parsing log files, processing CSV data with nested fields, or cleaning up user input, knowing how to split strings effectively is essential. Let’s explore practical solutions that you can start using right away.\n\nThe most straightforward approach starts with Python’s built-in string splitting. While not the most elegant solution, it’s perfect for quick tasks and easy to understand:\n\nThink of this like cutting a piece of paper: first you cut along all the horizontal lines, then you take each strip and cut along the vertical lines. It’s simple but gets tedious if you have many different delimiters.\n\nThe `re.split()` function is like having a smart pair of scissors that can cut along multiple patterns at once. It’s more sophisticated than str.split() and handles complex patterns with ease:\n\nThis method is much cleaner when dealing with multiple delimiters. Instead of making several passes through the text, it handles everything in one go. It’s like having a document scanner that can recognize and split on multiple types of markers simultaneously.\n\nReal-world data is often messy and structured in layers. Here’s a practical example that shows how to handle log files where different parts use different separators:\n\nThis example shows how to peel apart data like an onion — removing one layer of structure at a time. We first split the major sections, then process the detailed data section with its own set of delimiters.\n\nKeeping the Delimiters in the Result\n\nSometimes you need to know not just the pieces, but what separated them. This is useful when you need to reconstruct the string later or process the delimiters themselves:\n\nHere’s how to handle data that uses different delimiters for different levels of information — like a spreadsheet where some cells contain lists:\n\nReal data is messy. Here’s how to handle the edge cases you’ll encounter in the wild:\n\nEach of these methods has its place:\n\n- Use `str.split()` for quick, simple splits where readability matters most\n\n- Use `re.split()` when you need to split on multiple delimiters at once\n\n- Use custom functions when you need special handling of empty fields, whitespace, or nested structures\n\nPick the approach that matches your data’s complexity and your code’s needs. The simplest solution that works is usually the best choice."

One of these classes, d, which matches any decimal digit, will be used. Learning how to split data may be valuable. Data arrives in various kinds and sizes, and it's sometimes not as clean as we'd like. You frequently wish to divide a string by more than one delimiter to make it easier to deal with. The built-in regular expression library re is the easiest way to split a string.\n\nThe library has a.split() function that works similarly to the above example. This approach stands out since it lets you separate our strings using regular expressions.\n\nsplit() − Split a string into a list where each word is a list item −\n\nseparator − Optional. Specifies the separator to use when splitting the string. By default, any whitespace is a separator.\n\nmaxsplit − Optional. Specifies how many splits to do. The default value is -1, which is \"all occurrences\".\n\nNote − If capturing parentheses are used in the pattern, then the text of all groups in the pattern is also returned as part of the resulting list.\n\nReturn Value − It divides the target text according to the regular expression pattern and returns a list of matches.\n• The method will split the string on all occurrences of one of the delimiters.\n\nA pattern and a string are given to the re.split function, which separates the string on each occurrence of the pattern.\n\nThe pipe | symbol represents an OR. Choose from A and B. In the first example, a comma and a hyphen are used as the string delimiters. The second example divides the string using a comma, a hyphen, and a colon as the delimiters. In your regular expression, you are free to use as many | characters as you choose. Alternatively, you may denote a group of characters using square brackets [].\n\nA pattern and a string are given to the re.split function, which separates the string on each occurrence of the pattern.\n\nThe pipe | symbol represents an OR.

A built-in Python method called string split() divides a string into a list.\n• Use the method to replace the first delimiter with the second.\n• Use the method to split the string by the second delimiter.\n\nImport re from regex module. Store a string in a variable named my_str_2. Use replace method from to first delimiter with the second to replace the string. Use split method to split the string by the second delimiter. Print my_list to get the desired result.\n\nFirst, we replace every occurrence of the first delimiter with the second, and then we split on the second delimiter. The str.replace method returns a copy of the string with all occurrences of a substring replaced by the provided replacement.\n\nAdditionally, you have the option of altogether avoiding the re-module. You can also complete this without the module if you feel more comfortable doing so because the module can be a bit daunting.\n\nThe example below shows how to divide a Python string with multiple delimiters by first changing values.
