        "document": "GDScript is a high-level, object-oriented, imperative, and gradually typed programming language built for Godot. It uses an indentation-based syntax similar to languages like Python. Its goal is to be optimized for and tightly integrated with Godot Engine, allowing great flexibility for content creation and integration.\n\nGDScript is entirely independent from Python and is not based on it.\n\nThere are also two constructs that look like literals, but actually are not: Integers and floats can have their numbers separated with to make them more readable. The following ways to write numbers are all valid: Regular string literals can contain the following escape sequences: There are two ways to represent an escaped Unicode character above : Also, using followed by a newline inside a string will allow you to continue it in the next line, without inserting a newline character in the string itself. A string enclosed in quotes of one type (for example ) can contain quotes of another type (for example ) without escaping. Triple-quoted strings allow you to avoid escaping up to two consecutive quotes of the same type (unless they are adjacent to the string edges). Raw string literals always encode the string as it appears in the source code. This is especially useful for regular expressions. A raw string literal doesn't process escape sequences, however it does recognize and ( ) and replaces them with themselves. Thus, a string can have a quote that matches the opening one, but only if it's preceded by a backslash. Some strings cannot be represented using raw string literals: you cannot have an odd number of backslashes at the end of a string or have an unescaped opening quote inside the string. However, in practice this doesn't matter since you can use a different quote type or use concatenation with a regular string literal.\n\nBuilt-in types are stack-allocated. They are passed as values. This means a copy is created on each assignment or when passing them as arguments to functions. The exceptions are , , , and packed arrays (such as ), which are passed by reference so they are shared. All arrays, , and some objects ( , ) have a method that allows you to make a copy. A variable in GDScript can be assigned to several built-in types. is an empty data type that contains no information and can not be assigned any other value. Only types that inherit from Object can have a value (Object is therefore called a \"nullable\" type). Variant types must have a valid value at all times, and therefore cannot have a value. Short for \"boolean\", it can only contain or . Short for \"integer\", it stores whole numbers (positive and negative). It is stored as a 64-bit value, equivalent to in C++. Stores real numbers, including decimals, using floating-point values. It is stored as a 64-bit value, equivalent to in C++. Note: Currently, data structures such as , , and store 32-bit single-precision values. An immutable string that allows only one instance of each name. They are slower to create and may result in waiting for locks when multithreading. In exchange, they're very fast to compare, which makes them good candidates for dictionary keys. A pre-parsed path to a node or a node property. It can be easily assigned to, and from, a String. They are useful to interact with the tree to get a node, or affecting properties like with Tweens. 2D vector type containing and fields. Can also be accessed as an array. Same as a Vector2 but the components are integers. Useful for representing items in a 2D grid. 2D Rectangle type containing two vectors fields: and . Also contains an field which is . 3D vector type containing , and fields. This can also be accessed as an array. Same as Vector3 but the components are integers. Can be use for indexing items in a 3D grid. 3D Plane type in normalized form that contains a vector field and a scalar distance. Quaternion is a datatype used for representing a 3D rotation. It's useful for interpolating rotations. Axis-aligned bounding box (or 3D box) contains 2 vectors fields: and . Also contains an field which is . 3x3 matrix used for 3D rotation and scale. It contains 3 vector fields ( , and ) and can also be accessed as an array of 3D vectors. Color data type contains , , , and fields. It can also be accessed as , , and for hue/saturation/value. Base class for anything that is not a built-in type. Generic sequence of arbitrary object types, including other arrays or dictionaries (see below). The array can resize dynamically. Arrays are indexed starting from index . Negative indices count from the end. # Same as the previous line, but shorter. # Replacing value 1 with \"Hi!\". # Array is now [\"Hi!\", 2, 3, 4]. Godot 4.0 added support for typed arrays. On write operations, Godot checks that element values match the specified type, so the array cannot contain invalid values. The GDScript static analyzer takes typed arrays into account, however array methods like and still have the return type. Typed arrays have the syntax , where can be any type, native or user class, or enum. Nested array types (like ) are not supported. and are the same thing. Arrays are passed by reference, so the array element type is also an attribute of the in-memory structure referenced by a variable in runtime. The static type of a variable restricts the structures that it can reference to. Therefore, you cannot assign an array with a different element type, even if the type is a subtype of the required type. If you want to convert a typed array, you can create a new array and use the Array.assign() method: # (OK) You can add the value to the array because `Node2D` extends `Node`. # (Error) You cannot assign an `Array[Node2D]` to an `Array[Node]` variable. # (OK) But you can use the `assign()` method instead. Unlike the `=` operator, # the `assign()` method copies the contents of the array, not the reference. The only exception was made for the ( ) type, for user convenience and compatibility with old code. However, operations on untyped arrays are considered unsafe. PackedArrays are generally faster to iterate on and modify compared to a typed Array of the same type (e.g. PackedInt64Array versus Array[int]) and consume less memory. In the worst case, they are expected to be as fast as an untyped Array. Conversely, non-Packed Arrays (typed or not) have extra convenience methods such as Array.map that PackedArrays lack. Consult the class reference for details on the methods available. Typed Arrays are generally faster to iterate on and modify than untyped Arrays. While all Arrays can cause memory fragmentation when they become large enough, if memory usage and performance (iteration and modification speed) is a concern and the type of data you're storing is compatible with one of the Array types, then using those may yield improvements. However, if you do not have such concerns (e.g. the size of your array does not reach the tens of thousands of elements) it is likely more helpful to use regular or typed Arrays, as they provide convenience methods that can make your code easier to write and maintain (and potentially faster if your data requires such operations a lot). If the data you will store is of a known type (including your own defined classes), prefer to use a typed Array as it may yield better performance in iteration and modification compared to an untyped Array.\n• None PackedByteArray: An array of bytes (integers from 0 to 255). Associative container which contains values referenced by unique keys. Lua-style table syntax is also supported. Lua-style uses instead of and doesn't use quotes to mark string keys (making for slightly less to write). However, keys written in this form can't start with a digit (like any GDScript identifier), and must be string literals. To add a key to an existing dictionary, access it like an existing key and assign to it: # Add String \"waiting\" as a key and assign the value 14 to it. # Add integer 4 as a key and assign the String \"hello\" as its value. # Add String \"Godot\" as a key and assign the value 3.01 to it. # Prints \"hello\" by indexing the dictionary with a dynamic key. # This is not the same as `d.test`. The bracket syntax equivalent to The bracket syntax can be used to access properties of any Object, not just Dictionaries. Keep in mind it will cause a script error when attempting to index a non-existing property. To avoid this, use the Object.get() and Object.set() methods instead. A signal is a message that can be emitted by an object to those who want to listen to it. The Signal type can be used for passing the emitter around. Signals are better used by getting them from actual objects, e.g. . Contains an object and a function, which is useful for passing functions as values (e.g. when connecting to signals). Getting a method as a member returns a callable. will set the value of to a callable with as the object and as the method. You can call it using the method: .\n\nVariables can exist as class members or local to functions. They are created with the keyword and may, optionally, be assigned a value upon initialization. # Variables are always initialized in direct order (see below). Variables can optionally have a type specification. When a type is specified, the variable will be forced to have always that same type, and trying to assign an incompatible value will raise an error. Types are specified in the variable declaration using a (colon) symbol after the variable name, followed by the type. If the variable is initialized within the declaration, the type can be inferred, so it's possible to omit the type name: Type inference is only possible if the assigned value has a defined type, otherwise it will raise an error.\n• None Constant names if they contain a script resource ( if you declared ).\n• None Other classes in the same script, respecting scope ( if you declared inside the in the same scope). While is a valid type specification, it's not an actual type. It only means there's no set type and is equivalent to not having a static type at all. Therefore, inference is not allowed by default for , since it's likely a mistake. You can turn off this check, or make it only a warning, by changing it in the project settings. See GDScript warning system for details. Member variables are initialized in the following order:\n• None Depending on the variable's static type, the variable is either (untyped variables and objects) or has a default value of the type ( for , for , etc.).\n• None The specified values are assigned in the order of the variables in the script, from top to bottom.\n• None (Only for -derived classes) If the annotation is applied to a variable, its initialization is deferred to step 5.\n• None If defined, the method is called.\n• None When instantiating scenes and resources, the exported values are assigned.\n• None (Only for -derived classes) variables are initialized.\n• None (Only for -derived classes) If defined, the method is called. You can specify a complex expression as a variable initializer, including function calls. Make sure the variables are initialized in the correct order, otherwise your values may be overwritten. For example: To fix this, move the variable definition above the definition or remove the empty dictionary assignment ( ). Static variables belong to the class, not instances. This means that static variables share values between multiple instances, unlike regular member variables. From inside a class, you can access static variables from any function, both static and non-static. From outside the class, you can access static variables using the class or an instance (the second is not recommended as it is less readable). The and annotations cannot be applied to a static variable. Local variables cannot be static. The following example defines a class with a static variable named . We increment the in the function. This makes it easy to keep track of the number of instances in our game. In this code, we create two instances of our class and check that the class and every instance have the same value, because the variable is static and accessible to every instance. Static variables can have type hints, setters and getters: A base class static variable can also be accessed via a child class: Since GDScript classes are resources, having static variables in a script prevents it from being unloaded even if there are no more instances of that class and no other references left. This can be important if static variables store large amounts of data or hold references to other project resources, such as scenes. You should clean up this data manually, or use the @static_unload annotation if static variables don't store important data and can be reset. Currently, due to a bug, scripts are never freed, even if annotation is used. Note that applies to the entire script (including inner classes) and must be placed at the top of the script, before and : See also Static functions and Static constructor. Values assigned to typed variables must have a compatible type. If it's needed to coerce a value to be of a certain type, in particular for object types, you can use the casting operator . Casting between object types results in the same object if the value is of the same type or a subtype of the cast type. # Works since Sprite2D is a subtype of Node2D. If the value is not a subtype, the casting operation will result in a value. # Results in 'null' since a Button is not a subtype of Node2D. For built-in types, they will be forcibly converted if possible, otherwise the engine will raise an error. # The string can be converted to int. # A Vector2 can't be converted to int, this will cause an error. Casting is also useful to have better type-safe variables when interacting with the scene tree: # Will infer the variable to be of type Sprite2D. # Will fail if $AnimPlayer is not an AnimationPlayer, even if it has the method 'play()'.\n\nFunctions always belong to a class. The scope priority for variable look-up is: local → class member → global. The variable is always available and is provided as an option for accessing class members (see self), but is not always required (and should not be sent as the function's first argument, unlike Python). # Return is optional; without it 'null' is returned. A function can at any point. The default return value is . If a function contains only one line of code, it can be written on one line: Functions can also have type specification for the arguments and for the return value. Types for arguments can be added in a similar way to variables: If a function argument has a default value, it's possible to infer the type: The return type of the function can be specified after the arguments list using the arrow token ( ): Functions that have a return type must return a proper value. Setting the type as means the function doesn't return anything. Void functions can return early with the keyword, but they can't return any value. Non-void functions must always return a value, so if your code has branching statements (such as an / construct), all the possible paths must have a return. E.g., if you have a inside an block but not after it, the editor will raise an error because if the block is not executed, the function won't have a valid value to return. Functions are first-class values in terms of the Callable object. Referencing a function by name without calling it will automatically generate the proper callable. This can be used to pass functions as arguments. Callables must be called with the call() method. You cannot use the operator directly. This behavior is implemented to avoid performance issues on direct function calls. Lambda functions allow you to declare functions that do not belong to a class. Instead, a Callable object is created and assigned to a variable directly. This can be useful to create callables to pass around without polluting the class scope. To call the created lambda you can use the call() method: Lambda functions can be named for debugging purposes (the name is displayed in the Debugger): You can specify type hints for lambda functions in the same way as for regular ones: Note that if you want to return a value from a lambda function, an explicit is required (you can't omit ): Local variables are captured by value once, when the lambda is created. So they won't be updated in the lambda if reassigned in the outer function: Also, a lambda cannot reassign an outer local variable. After exiting the lambda, the variable will be unchanged, because the lambda capture implicitly shadows it: However, if you use pass-by-reference data types (arrays, dictionaries, and objects), then the content changes are shared until you reassign the variable: A function can be declared static. When a function is static, it has no access to the instance member variables or . A static function has access to static variables. Also static functions are useful to make libraries of helper functions: See also Static variables and Static constructor.\n\nStatements are standard and can be assignments, function calls, control flow structures, etc (see below). as a statement separator is entirely optional. Expressions are sequences of operators and their operands in orderly fashion. An expression by itself can be a statement too, though only calls are reasonable to use as statements since other expressions don't have side effects. Expressions return values that can be assigned to valid targets. Operands to some operator can be another expression. An assignment is not an expression and thus does not return any value. Here are some examples of expressions: Identifiers, attributes, and subscripts are valid assignment targets. Other expressions cannot be on the left side of an assignment. can be used to refer to the current instance and is often equivalent to directly referring to symbols available in the current script. However, also allows you to access properties, methods, and other names that are defined dynamically (i.e. are expected to exist in subtypes of the current class, or are provided using _set() and/or _get()). # Compile time error, as `my_var` is not defined in the current class or its ancestors. # Checked at runtime, thus may work for dynamic properties or descendant classes. # Compile time error, as `my_func()` is not defined in the current class or its ancestors. # Checked at runtime, thus may work for descendant classes. Beware that accessing members of child classes in the base class is often considered a bad practice, because this blurs the area of responsibility of any given piece of code, making the overall relationship between parts of your game harder to reason about. Besides that, one can simply forget that the parent class had some expectations about it's descendants. Simple conditions are created by using the / / syntax. Parenthesis around conditions are allowed, but not required. Given the nature of the tab-based indentation, can be used instead of / to maintain a level of indentation. Short statements can be written on the same line as the condition: Sometimes, you might want to assign a different initial value based on a boolean expression. In this case, ternary-if expressions come in handy: Ternary-if expressions can be nested to handle more than 2 cases. When nesting ternary-if expressions, it is recommended to wrap the complete expression over multiple lines to preserve readability: # Alternative syntax with backslashes instead of parentheses (for multi-line expressions). # Less lines required, but harder to refactor. You may also wish to check if a value is contained within something. You can use an statement combined with the operator to accomplish this: # Check if a letter is in a string. # Check if a variable is contained within a node. Simple loops are created by using syntax. Loops can be broken using or continued using (which skips to the next iteration of the loop without executing any further code in the current iteration): To iterate through a range, such as an array or table, a for loop is used. When iterating over an array, the current array element is stored in the loop variable. When iterating over a dictionary, the key is stored in the loop variable. # Loop iterates 3 times with 'x' as 5, then 7 and finally 11. # Similar to [0, 1, 2] but does not allocate an array. # Similar to [1, 2] but does not allocate an array. # Similar to [2, 4, 6] but does not allocate an array. # Similar to [8, 6, 4] but does not allocate an array. # Iterate through all characters in a String, print every letter on new line. If you want to assign values on an array as it is being iterated through, it is best to use . The loop variable is local to the for-loop and assigning to it will not change the value on the array. Objects passed by reference (such as nodes) can still be manipulated by calling methods on the loop variable. A statement is used to branch execution of a program. It's the equivalent of the statement found in many other languages, but offers some additional features. is more type strict than the operator. For example will not match . The only exception is vs matching: for example, the String is considered equal to the StringName . Crash-course for people who are familiar with switch statements The patterns are matched from top to bottom. If a pattern matches, the first corresponding block will be executed. After that, the execution continues below the statement. The special behavior in supported in 3.x was removed in Godot 4.0. The following pattern types are available:\n• None \"Two are better than one!\"\n• None Matches a constant expression, an identifier, or an attribute access ( ):\n• None This pattern matches everything. It's written as a single underscore. It can be used as the equivalent of the in a statement in other languages: \"It's not 1 or 2. I don't care to be honest.\"\n• None A binding pattern introduces a new variable. Like the wildcard pattern, it matches everything - and also gives that value a name. It's especially useful in array and dictionary patterns:\n• None Matches an array. Every single element of the array pattern is a pattern itself, so you can nest them. The length of the array is tested first, it has to be the same size as the pattern, otherwise the pattern doesn't match. Open-ended array: An array can be bigger than the pattern by making the last subpattern . Every subpattern has to be comma-separated.\n• None Works in the same way as the array pattern. Every key has to be a constant pattern. The size of the dictionary is tested first, it has to be the same size as the pattern, otherwise the pattern doesn't match. Open-ended dictionary: A dictionary can be bigger than the pattern by making the last subpattern . Every subpattern has to be comma separated. If you don't specify a value, then only the existence of the key is checked. A value pattern is separated from the key pattern with a . \"Has a name and an age, but it's not Dennis :(\" \"I only checked for one entry and ignored the rest\"\n• None You can also specify multiple patterns separated by a comma. These patterns aren't allowed to have any bindings in them. A pattern guard is an optional condition that follows the pattern list and allows you to make additional checks before choosing a branch. Unlike a pattern, a pattern guard can be an arbitrary expression. Only one branch can be executed per . Once a branch is chosen, the rest are not checked. If you want to use the same pattern for multiple branches or to prevent choosing a branch with too general pattern, you can specify a pattern guard after the list of patterns with the keyword:\n• None If there is no matching pattern for the current branch, the pattern guard is not evaluated and the patterns of the next branch are checked.\n• None If a matching pattern is found, the pattern guard is evaluated.\n• None If it's true, then the body of the branch is executed and ends.\n• None If it's false, then the patterns of the next branch are checked.\n\nBy default, all script files are unnamed classes. In this case, you can only reference them using the file's path, using either a relative or an absolute path. For example, if you name a script file : # Load character.gd and create a new node instance from it. You can give your class a name to register it as a new type in Godot's editor. For that, you use the keyword. You can optionally use the annotation with a path to an image, to use it as an icon. Your class will then appear with its new icon in the editor: SVG images that are used as custom node icons should have the Editor > Scale With Editor Scale and Editor > Convert Icons With Editor Theme import options enabled. This allows icons to follow the editor's scale and theming settings if the icons are designed with the same color palette as Godot's own icons. If you want to use too, you can keep both on the same line: Named classes are globally registered, which means they become available to use in other scripts without the need to or them: Godot initializes non-static variables every time you create an instance, and this includes arrays and dictionaries. This is in the spirit of thread safety, since scripts can be initialized in separate threads without the user knowing. The Godot editor will hide these custom classes with names that begin with the prefix \"Editor\" in the 'Create New Node' or 'Create New Scene' dialog windows. The classes are available for instantiation at runtime via their class names, but are automatically hidden by the editor windows along with the built-in editor nodes used by the Godot editor. A class (stored as a file) can inherit from:\n• None An inner class inside another class file. # Inherit/extend an inner class in another file. If inheritance is not explicitly defined, the class will default to inheriting RefCounted. To check if a given instance inherits from a given class, the keyword can be used: # Use 'is' to check inheritance. To call a function in a super class (i.e. one -ed in your current class), use the keyword: This is especially useful because functions in extending classes replace functions with the same name in their super classes. If you still want to call them, you can use : # Calls the same function on the super class. If you need to call a different function from the super class, you can specify the function name with the attribute operator: # This overrides the method in the base class. # This calls the method as defined in the base class. One of the common misconceptions is trying to override non-virtual engine methods such as , , etc. This is not supported for technical reasons. In Godot 3, you can shadow engine methods in GDScript, and it will work if you call this method in GDScript. However, the engine will not execute your code if the method is called inside the engine on some event. In Godot 4, even shadowing may not always work, as GDScript optimizes native method calls. Therefore, we added the warning, which is treated as an error by default. We strongly advise against disabling or ignoring the warning. Note that this does not apply to virtual methods such as , and others (marked with the qualifier in the documentation and the names start with an underscore). These methods are specifically for customizing engine behavior and can be overridden in GDScript. Signals and notifications can also be useful for these purposes. The class constructor, called on class instantiation, is named . If you want to call the base class constructor, you can also use the syntax. Note that every class has an implicit constructor that is always called (defining the default values of class variables). is used to call the explicit constructor: This is better explained through examples. Consider this scenario: There are a few things to keep in mind here:\n• None If the inherited class ( ) defines a constructor that takes arguments ( in this case), then the inheriting class ( ) must define as well and pass appropriate parameters to from .\n• None can have a different number of arguments than the base class .\n• None In the example above, passed to the constructor is the same passed in to .\n• None If 's constructor takes 0 arguments, it still needs to pass some value to the base class, even if it does nothing. This brings us to the fact that you can pass expressions to the base constructor as well, not just variables, e.g.: A static constructor is a static function that is called automatically when the class is loaded, after the static variables have been initialized: A static constructor cannot take arguments and must not return any value. A class file can contain inner classes. Inner classes are defined using the keyword. They are instanced using the function. # An inner class in this class file. # This is the constructor of the class file's main class. Classes stored as files are treated as GDScripts. They must be loaded from disk to access them in other classes. This is done using either the or functions (see below). Instancing of a loaded class resource is done by calling the function on the class object: # Preload the class only once at compile time.\n\nSignals are a tool to emit messages from an object that other objects can react to. To create custom signals for a class, use the keyword. Signals are a Callback mechanism. They also fill the role of Observers, a common programming pattern. For more information, read the Observer tutorial in the Game Programming Patterns ebook. You can connect these signals to methods the same way you connect built-in signals of nodes like Button or RigidBody3D. In the example below, we connect the signal from a node to a node. When the node emits the signal, the game node's is called: You can emit as many arguments as you want along with a signal. Here is an example where this is useful. Let's say we want a life bar on screen to react to health changes with an animation, but we want to keep the user interface separate from the player in our scene tree. In our script, we define a signal and emit it with Signal.emit(), and from a node higher up our scene tree, we connect it to the using the Signal.connect() method: # We emit the health_changed signal every time the # Here, we define a function to use as a callback when the # Imagine that `animate` is a user-defined function that animates the # bar filling up or emptying itself. In the node, we get both the and nodes, then connect the character, that emits the signal, to the receiver, the node in this case. This allows the to react to health changes without coupling it to the node. You can write optional argument names in parentheses after the signal's definition: These arguments show up in the editor's node dock, and Godot can use them to generate callback functions for you. However, you can still emit any number of arguments when you emit signals; it's up to you to emit the correct values. You can also create copies of GDScript Callable objects which accept additional arguments using Callable.bind(). This allows you to add extra information to the connection if the emitted signal itself doesn't give you access to all the data that you need. When the signal is emitted, the callback method receives the bound values, in addition to those provided by the signal. Building on the example above, let's say we want to display a log of the damage taken by each character on the screen, like . The signal doesn't give us the name of the character that took damage. So when we connect the signal to the in-game console, we can add the character's name using the bind method: Our node receives each bound element as an extra argument: The keyword can be used to create coroutines which wait until a signal is emitted before continuing execution. Using the keyword with a signal or a call to a function that is also a coroutine will immediately return the control to the caller. When the signal is emitted (or the called coroutine finishes), it will resume execution from the point on where it stopped. For example, to stop execution until the user presses a button, you can do something like this: # Waits for the button_up signal from Button node. In this case, the becomes a coroutine, which means that the caller also needs to await it: Note that requesting a coroutine's return value without will trigger an error: However, if you don't depend on the result, you can just call it asynchronously, which won't stop execution and won't make the current function a coroutine: \"This will be printed immediately, before the user press the button.\" If you use await with an expression that isn't a signal nor a coroutine, the value will be returned immediately and the function won't give the control back to the caller: This also means that returning a signal from a function that isn't a coroutine will make the caller await that signal: Unlike in previous Godot versions, you cannot obtain the function state object. This is done to ensure type safety. With this type safety in place, a function cannot say that it returns an while it actually returns a function state object during runtime."

        "document": "Describe the project you are working on\n\nCurrently working on the Github Game Off jam game I started, which includes several enemies that use state machines to handle both the physics of moving, and the physics of taking damage (as separate states stored in the same machine). https://github.com/WolfgangSenff/GameOffJam2020\n\nDescribe the problem or limitation you are having in your project\n\nI've noticed whenever I have to reference one of the state machines I mentioned above - as well as the states themselves (and any nodes within those) - if the enemies is defeated and queue-freed, if anything with in a yield state or anything like that, when it comes back it's still causing a ton of issues. Not only that, but it can still call to the state machine to handle damage/physics (especially physics in this case, since that's in the _physics_process method). is_instance_valid is necessary for this case (and sometimes I have to check for nullity as well), but I call it for multiple objects at times and it is really clunky, especially combined with a null check, even if that null check is just . Combine that with the fact that if multi-threading is turned on, it seems like if you have an is_instance_valid in an if, the code in the if is not called as a single operation, and so could become unsafe to use even after calling is_instance_valid. Note: I do not know this for a fact, I'm just inferring it from how other languages work; please correct me if I'm wrong (mostly because I typically do not turn on multi-threading for Godot and I'd genuinely like to know).\n\nDescribe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nEssentially, it would cut down on highly error-prone code and code that already, in and of itself, feels sort of hacky since you wouldn't expect it to be running in the first place (since the object was in my examples/games queue-freed already). Not only this, it significantly cuts down on the number of lines of code, which for most code-bases for any sufficiently complex game would be extremely helpful.\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\n\nThe main proposal is simply having this as an example:\n\nThis would equate to the following expanded code:\n\nIt's unclear to me at this point if the expanded code can effectively be forced into a single operation similar to how it's done in other languages, but it wouldn't strictly be necessary...just, in theory, much better for multi-threading. (Again, this is just my inference from other languages.)\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nTechnically, this is just meant to be a way to significantly shorten code that comes up a lot in GDScript when working with things which run during _process or _physics_process, so while it definitely can be \"worked around\", the whole point is to not have to work around it - to make the code simpler to read by many factors while removing error-prone code.\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and not an add-on in the asset library?\n\nI don't believe it can be an add-on - at the least, it feels like a very core piece of functionality to the language. Let me put it this way: I do not see any way it can be an add-on."

        "document": "Here is a tip I learned quite the hard way when I started with Godot and C#: It is better to avoid code like this:\n\nWhat's wrong with this code? You may wonder. The problem is this this code will crash if _myNode was freed. And if your project is somewhat large, well ... this is going to happen someday.\n\nThus, instead of just checking for nullrefs, I think it is almost always safer to also check that the reference is not null *and not deleted* . I do it like this:\n\nwhere IsValid() is the following extension method:\n\nNote that my IsValid method checks for nullref and deleted node, as you would expect, but also for nodes * about to get deleted * , with IsQueuedForDeletion. This last part may be more controversial, but if a node is going to get deleted in the next frame there is usually no point in touching it.\n\nAnother extension I use a lot is this one:\n\nIndeed, calling QueueFree on an already deleted node will crash. I ended replacing all my calls to QueueFree by SafeQueueFree.\n\nFinally, I also like using this extension, allowing for one-liners with the ? operator:\n\nHope you will find this as useful as I did!"
