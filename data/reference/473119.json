Read below for how to get started and what is contained in the new major release.\n\nWe’re maintaining functional API compatibility for most users to make the migration an easy choice for almost everyone. Most changes are either to default configurations, supported Python versions, or internal implementation details. So unless you’re in a specific situation you should notice no changes! 🎉 If you have difficulty migrating to v2.0 or following this guide you can open an issue on GitHub or reach out in our community Discord channel. The 2.x initial release schedule will look like this:\n• None urllib3 will be released in November 2022. This release contains minor breaking changes and deprecation warnings for other breaking changes. There may be other pre-releases to address fixes before v2.0.0 is released.\n• None urllib3 will be released in early 2023 after some initial integration testing against dependent packages and fixing of bug reports.\n• None urllib3 will be released in the summer of 2023 with all breaking changes being warned about in v2.0.0. Please take the you receive when migrating from v1.x to v2.0 seriously as they will become errors after 2.1.0 is released. What are the important changes?¶ Here’s a short summary of which changes in urllib3 v2.0 are most important:\n• None Python version must be 3.7 or later (previously supported Python 2.7, 3.5, and 3.6).\n• None Removed support for non-OpenSSL TLS libraries (like LibreSSL and wolfSSL).\n• None Removed support for Python implementations that aren’t CPython or PyPy3 (previously supported Google App Engine, Jython).\n• None Deprecated the , modules, will be removed in v2.1.0.\n• None Deprecated the extra, will be removed in v2.1.0.\n• None Deprecated the method in favor of , will be removed in v2.1.0.\n• None Deprecated the method in favor of , will be removed in v2.1.0.\n• None Deprecated URLs without a scheme (ie ‘https://’) and will be raising an error in a future version of urllib3.\n• None Changed the default minimum TLS version to TLS 1.2 (previously was TLS 1.0).\n• None Changed the default request body encoding from ‘ISO-8859-1’ to ‘UTF-8’.\n• None Removed support for verifying certificate hostnames via , now only is used.\n• None Removed the default set of TLS ciphers, instead now urllib3 uses the list of ciphers configured by the system. For a full list of changes you can look at the changelog. If you’re a maintainer of a package that uses urllib3 under the hood then this section is for you. You may have already seen an issue opened from someone on our team about the upcoming release. The primary goal for migrating to urllib3 v2.x should be to ensure your package supports both urllib3 v1.26.x and v2.0 for some time. This is to reduce the chance that diamond dependencies are introduced into your users’ dependencies which will then cause issues with them upgrading to the latest version of your package. The first step to supporting urllib3 v2.0 is to make sure the version v2.x not being excluded by . You should ensure your package allows for both urllib3 1.26.x and 2.0 to be used: Next you should try installing urllib3 v2.0 locally and run your test suite. Because there are many you should ensure that you’re able to see those warnings when running your test suite. To do so you can add the following to your test setup to ensure even are output to the terminal: $ # Run your test suite and look for failures. $ pytest tests/ or you can opt-in within your Python code: # You can change warning filters according to the filter rules: Any failures or deprecation warnings you receive should be fixed as urllib3 v2.1.0 will remove all deprecated features. Many deprecation warnings will make suggestions about what to do to avoid the deprecated feature. Warnings will look something like this: DeprecationWarning: option is deprecated and will be removed urllib3 v2.1.0. Instead use Continue removing deprecation warnings until there are no more. After this you can publish a new release of your package that supports both urllib3 v1.26.x and v2.x. If you’re not able to support both 1.26.x and v2.0 of urllib3 at the same time with your package please open an issue on GitHub or reach out in our community Discord channel. If you’re someone who writes Python but doesn’t ship as a package (things like web services, data science, tools, and more) this section is for you. Python environments only allow for one version of a dependency to be installed per environment which means that all of your dependencies using urllib3 need to support v2.0 for you to upgrade. The best way to visualize relationships between your dependencies is using pipdeptree and : $ python -m pip install pipdeptree # We only care about packages requiring urllib3 $ pipdeptree --reverse grep - .29.8 requires: urllib3> .25.4,< - .28.1 requires: urllib3> .21.1,< Reading the output from above, there are two packages which depend on urllib3: and . The versions of these two packages both require urllib3 that is less than v2.0 (ie ). Because both of these packages require urllib3 before v2.0 the new version of urllib3 can’t be installed by default. There are ways to force installing the newer version of urllib3 v2.0 (ie pinning to ) which you can do to test your application. It’s important to know that even if you don’t upgrade all of your services to 2.x immediately you will for some time. Thanks to support from Tidelift we’re able to continue supporting the v1.26.x release stream with security fixes for the foreseeable future 💖 However, upgrading is still recommended as no new feature developments or non-critical bug fixes will be shipped to the 1.26.x release stream.

        "document": "Warning messages are typically issued in situations where it is useful to alert the user of some condition in a program, where that condition (normally) doesn’t warrant raising an exception and terminating the program. For example, one might want to issue a warning when a program uses an obsolete module.\n\nPython programmers issue warnings by calling the function defined in this module. (C programmers use ; see Exception Handling for details).\n\nWarning messages are normally written to , but their disposition can be changed flexibly, from ignoring all warnings to turning them into exceptions. The disposition of warnings can vary based on the warning category, the text of the warning message, and the source location where it is issued. Repetitions of a particular warning for the same source location are typically suppressed.\n\nThere are two stages in warning control: first, each time a warning is issued, a determination is made whether a message should be issued or not; next, if a message is to be issued, it is formatted and printed using a user-settable hook.\n\nThe determination whether to issue a warning message is controlled by the warning filter, which is a sequence of matching rules and actions. Rules can be added to the filter by calling and reset to its default state by calling .\n\nThe printing of warning messages is done by calling , which may be overridden; the default implementation of this function formats the message by calling , which is also available for use by custom implementations.\n\nThere are a number of built-in exceptions that represent warning categories. This categorization is useful to be able to filter out groups of warnings. While these are technically built-in exceptions, they are documented here, because conceptually they belong to the warnings mechanism. User code can define additional warning categories by subclassing one of the standard warning categories. A warning category must always be a subclass of the class. The following warnings category classes are currently defined: This is the base class of all warning category classes. It is a subclass of . Base category for warnings about deprecated features when those warnings are intended for other Python developers (ignored by default, unless triggered by code in ). Base category for warnings about deprecated features when those warnings are intended for end users of applications that are written in Python. Base category for warnings about features that will be deprecated in the future (ignored by default). Base category for warnings triggered during the process of importing a module (ignored by default). Base category for warnings related to and . Base category for warnings related to resource usage (ignored by default). Changed in version 3.7: Previously and were distinguished based on whether a feature was being removed entirely or changing its behaviour. They are now distinguished based on their intended audience and the way they’re handled by the default warnings filters.\n\nThe warnings filter controls whether warnings are ignored, displayed, or turned into errors (raising an exception). Conceptually, the warnings filter maintains an ordered list of filter specifications; any specific warning is matched against each filter specification in the list in turn until a match is found; the filter determines the disposition of the match. Each entry is a tuple of the form (action, message, category, module, lineno), where:\n• None action is one of the following strings: print the first occurrence of matching warnings for each location (module + line number) where the warning is issued print the first occurrence of matching warnings for each module where the warning is issued (regardless of line number) print only the first occurrence of matching warnings, regardless of location\n• None message is a string containing a regular expression that the start of the warning message must match, case-insensitively. In and , message is a literal string that the start of the warning message must contain (case-insensitively), ignoring any whitespace at the start or end of message.\n• None category is a class (a subclass of ) of which the warning category must be a subclass in order to match.\n• None module is a string containing a regular expression that the start of the fully qualified module name must match, case-sensitively. In and , module is a literal string that the fully qualified module name must be equal to (case-sensitively), ignoring any whitespace at the start or end of module.\n• None lineno is an integer that the line number where the warning occurred must match, or to match all line numbers. Since the class is derived from the built-in class, to turn a warning into an error we simply raise . If a warning is reported and doesn’t match any registered filter then the “default” action is applied (hence its name). The filters that suppress repeated warnings apply the following criteria to determine if a warning is considered a repeat:\n• None : A warning is considered a repeat only if the (message, category, module, lineno) are all the same.\n• None : A warning is considered a repeat if the (message, category, module) are the same, ignoring the line number.\n• None : A warning is considered a repeat if the (message, category) are the same, ignoring the module and line number. The warnings filter is initialized by options passed to the Python interpreter command line and the environment variable. The interpreter saves the arguments for all supplied entries without interpretation in ; the module parses these when it is first imported (invalid options are ignored, after printing a message to ). Individual warnings filters are specified as a sequence of fields separated by colons: The meaning of each of these fields is as described in The Warnings Filter. When listing multiple filters on a single line (as for ), the individual filters are separated by commas and the filters listed later take precedence over those listed before them (as they’re applied left-to-right, and the most recently applied filters take precedence over earlier ones). Commonly used warning filters apply to either all warnings, warnings in a particular category, or warnings raised by particular modules or packages. Some examples: # Show all warnings (even those ignored by default) By default, Python installs several warning filters, which can be overridden by the command-line option, the environment variable and calls to . In regular release builds, the default warning filter has the following entries (in order of precedence): In a debug build, the list of default warning filters is empty. Changed in version 3.2: is now ignored by default in addition to . Changed in version 3.7: is once again shown by default when triggered directly by code in . Changed in version 3.7: no longer appears in the default filter list and is instead configured via when is specified twice. Developers of applications written in Python may wish to hide all Python level warnings from their users by default, and only display them when running tests or otherwise working on the application. The attribute used to pass filter configurations to the interpreter can be used as a marker to indicate whether or not warnings should be disabled: Developers of test runners for Python code are advised to instead ensure that all warnings are displayed by default for the code under test, using code like: # Change the filter in this process Finally, developers of interactive shells that run user code in a namespace other than are advised to ensure that messages are made visible by default, using code like the following (where is the module used to execute code entered interactively):\n\nIf you are using code that you know will raise a warning, such as a deprecated function, but do not want to see the warning (even when warnings have been explicitly configured via the command line), then it is possible to suppress the warning using the context manager: While within the context manager all warnings will simply be ignored. This allows you to use known-deprecated code without having to see the warning while not suppressing the warning for other code that might not be aware of its use of deprecated code. Note: this can only be guaranteed in a single-threaded application. If two or more threads use the context manager at the same time, the behavior is undefined.\n\nTo test warnings raised by code, use the context manager. With it you can temporarily mutate the warnings filter to facilitate your testing. For instance, do the following to capture all raised warnings to check: # Cause all warnings to always be triggered. One can also cause all warnings to be exceptions by using instead of . One thing to be aware of is that if a warning has already been raised because of a / rule, then no matter what filters are set the warning will not be seen again unless the warnings registry related to the warning has been cleared. Once the context manager exits, the warnings filter is restored to its state when the context was entered. This prevents tests from changing the warnings filter in unexpected ways between tests and leading to indeterminate test results. The function in the module is also restored to its original value. Note: this can only be guaranteed in a single-threaded application. If two or more threads use the context manager at the same time, the behavior is undefined. When testing multiple operations that raise the same kind of warning, it is important to test them in a manner that confirms each operation is raising a new warning (e.g. set warnings to be raised as exceptions and check the operations raise exceptions, check that the length of the warning list continues to increase after each operation, or else delete the previous entries from the warnings list before each new operation).\n\nUpdating Code For New Versions of Dependencies¶ Warning categories that are primarily of interest to Python developers (rather than end users of applications written in Python) are ignored by default. Notably, this “ignored by default” list includes (for every module except ), which means developers should make sure to test their code with typically ignored warnings made visible in order to receive timely notifications of future breaking API changes (whether in the standard library or third party packages). In the ideal case, the code will have a suitable test suite, and the test runner will take care of implicitly enabling all warnings when running tests (the test runner provided by the module does this). In less ideal cases, applications can be checked for use of deprecated interfaces by passing to the Python interpreter (this is shorthand for ) or setting in the environment. This enables default handling for all warnings, including those that are ignored by default. To change what action is taken for encountered warnings you can change what argument is passed to (e.g. ). See the flag for more details on what is possible.\n\nIssue a warning, or maybe ignore it or raise an exception. The category argument, if given, must be a warning category class; it defaults to . Alternatively, message can be a instance, in which case category will be ignored and will be used. In this case, the message text will be . This function raises an exception if the particular warning issued is changed into an error by the warnings filter. The stacklevel argument can be used by wrapper functions written in Python, like this: This makes the warning refer to ’s caller, rather than to the source of itself (since the latter would defeat the purpose of the warning message). The skip_file_prefixes keyword argument can be used to indicate which stack frames are ignored when counting stack levels. This can be useful when you want the warning to always appear at call sites outside of a package when a constant stacklevel does not fit all call paths or is otherwise challenging to maintain. If supplied, it must be a tuple of strings. When prefixes are supplied, stacklevel is implicitly overridden to be . To cause a warning to be attributed to the caller from outside of the current package you might write: This makes the warning refer to both the and call sites only from calling code living outside of package. source, if supplied, is the destroyed object which emitted a . This is a low-level interface to the functionality of , passing in explicitly the message, category, filename and line number, and optionally the module name and the registry (which should be the dictionary of the module). The module name defaults to the filename with stripped; if no registry is passed, the warning is never suppressed. message must be a string and category a subclass of or message may be a instance, in which case category will be ignored. module_globals, if supplied, should be the global namespace in use by the code for which the warning is issued. (This argument is used to support displaying source for modules found in zipfiles or other non-filesystem import sources). source, if supplied, is the destroyed object which emitted a . Write a warning to a file. The default implementation calls and writes the resulting string to file, which defaults to . You may replace this function with any callable by assigning to . line is a line of source code to be included in the warning message; if line is not supplied, will try to read the line specified by filename and lineno. Format a warning the standard way. This returns a string which may contain embedded newlines and ends in a newline. line is a line of source code to be included in the warning message; if line is not supplied, will try to read the line specified by filename and lineno. Insert an entry into the list of warnings filter specifications. The entry is inserted at the front by default; if append is true, it is inserted at the end. This checks the types of the arguments, compiles the message and module regular expressions, and inserts them as a tuple in the list of warnings filters. Entries closer to the front of the list override entries later in the list, if both match a particular warning. Omitted arguments default to a value that matches everything. Insert a simple entry into the list of warnings filter specifications. The meaning of the function parameters is as for , but regular expressions are not needed as the filter inserted always matches any message in any module as long as the category and line number match. Reset the warnings filter. This discards the effect of all previous calls to , including that of the command line options and calls to . Decorator to indicate that a class, function or overload is deprecated. When this decorator is applied to an object, deprecation warnings may be emitted at runtime when the object is used. static type checkers will also generate a diagnostic on usage of the deprecated object. The warning specified by category will be emitted at runtime on use of deprecated objects. For functions, that happens on calls; for classes, on instantiation and on creation of subclasses. If the category is , no warning is emitted at runtime. The stacklevel determines where the warning is emitted. If it is (the default), the warning is emitted at the direct caller of the deprecated object; if it is higher, it is emitted further up the stack. Static type checker behavior is not affected by the category and stacklevel arguments. The deprecation message passed to the decorator is saved in the attribute on the decorated object. If applied to an overload, the decorator must be after the decorator for the attribute to exist on the overload as returned by ."

        "document": "There are times when the compiler informs the user of a condition in the program while the code is being executed. When it is necessary to advise the user of a program condition that (usually) doesn’t require raising an exception or terminating the program, warning messages are typically sent. Mostly, these warnings are descriptive of some underlying fault at work. But sometimes, they may not be required. This article will make you understand how to disable Python warnings in a very simple manner.\n\nWarnings are provided to warn the developer of situations that aren’t necessarily exceptions. Usually, a warning occurs when certain programming elements are obsolete, such as keyword, function or class, etc. A warning in a program is distinct from an error. Python program terminates immediately if an error occurs. Conversely, a warning is not critical. It shows some messages, but the program runs.\n\nThe following is a warning that occurs when the path environment variable does not contain the path to the scripts folder of the Python distribution.\n\nAgain, the task at hand (reinstalling pip) was successfully completed, but the compiler warned about an irregularity detected in the paths. Regardless of whether the issue is resolved or not, it did not have a direct impact on the task. But this may not always be true.\n\nThere are two ways in which warnings can be ignored:\n\nTo disable warnings from the code, the use of the warnings module would be made, and all the warnings would be filtered to be ignored. Hence, no warning would appear in the output. First, we will generate code that won’t need to turn off warnings, and then we will generate code that will. The warning is not disabled in the following code:\n\nIn the above code, a self-generated warning message was displayed. Since, by default, the program has warnings enabled, the message was displayed, and the warning appeared. Now, the warnings are disabled, then an attempt to display the warning has been made:\n\nThe output of the code omitted the warning due to the second statement, which calls the filterwarnings function and passes ignore as an argument. This filters all the warnings occurring during the code to be ignored. Due to this, the warning in the next statement didn’t appear.\n\nIn case the contents of the code can’t be modified to integrate the previous method into it, warnings can be disabled from the outside. This is done by passing the ignore argument to the -W switch of the Python compiler.\n\nHence, by integrating the -W “ignore” string in the command to execute the first code, the warnings in the code could be disabled. The code that is to be run from the command line would be:\n\nThe Python interpreter is instructed to disable the warnings before the execution of the test.py file (used in the first example). Similarly, using the following syntax:\n\nWarnings could be ignored during the execution of files containing Python code."
