        "document": "This module provides access to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard.\n\nThese functions cannot be used with complex numbers; use the functions of the same name from the module if you require support for complex numbers. The distinction between functions which support complex numbers and those which don’t is made since most users do not want to learn quite as much mathematics as required to understand complex numbers. Receiving an exception instead of a complex result allows earlier detection of the unexpected complex number used as a parameter, so that the programmer can determine how and why it was generated in the first place.\n\nThe following functions are provided by this module. Except when explicitly noted otherwise, all return values are floats.\n\nReturn the number of ways to choose k items from n items without repetition and without order. Evaluates to when and evaluates to zero when . Also called the binomial coefficient because it is equivalent to the coefficient of k-th term in polynomial expansion of . Raises if either of the arguments are not integers. Raises if either of the arguments are negative. Return n factorial as an integer. Raises if n is not integral or is negative. Changed in version 3.10: Floats with integral values (like ) are no longer accepted. Return the greatest common divisor of the specified integer arguments. If any of the arguments is nonzero, then the returned value is the largest positive integer that is a divisor of all arguments. If all arguments are zero, then the returned value is . without arguments returns . Changed in version 3.9: Added support for an arbitrary number of arguments. Formerly, only two arguments were supported. Return the integer square root of the nonnegative integer n. This is the floor of the exact square root of n, or equivalently the greatest integer a such that a² ≤ n. For some applications, it may be more convenient to have the least integer a such that n ≤ a², or in other words the ceiling of the exact square root of n. For positive n, this can be computed using . Return the least common multiple of the specified integer arguments. If all arguments are nonzero, then the returned value is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of all arguments. If any of the arguments is zero, then the returned value is . without arguments returns . Return the number of ways to choose k items from n items without repetition and with order. Evaluates to when and evaluates to zero when . If k is not specified or is , then k defaults to n and the function returns . Raises if either of the arguments are not integers. Raises if either of the arguments are negative.\n\nReturn the ceiling of x, the smallest integer greater than or equal to x. If x is not a float, delegates to , which should return an value. Return the absolute value of x. Return the floor of x, the largest integer less than or equal to x. If x is not a float, delegates to , which should return an value. Fused multiply-add operation. Return , computed as though with infinite precision and range followed by a single round to the format. This operation often provides better accuracy than the direct expression . This function follows the specification of the fusedMultiplyAdd operation described in the IEEE 754 standard. The standard leaves one case implementation-defined, namely the result of and . In these cases, returns a NaN, and does not raise any exception. Return the floating-point remainder of , as defined by the platform C library function . Note that the Python expression may not return the same result. The intent of the C standard is that be exactly (mathematically; to infinite precision) equal to for some integer n such that the result has the same sign as x and magnitude less than . Python’s returns a result with the sign of y instead, and may not be exactly computable for float arguments. For example, is , but the result of Python’s is , which cannot be represented exactly as a float, and rounds to the surprising . For this reason, function is generally preferred when working with floats, while Python’s is preferred when working with integers. Return the fractional and integer parts of x. Both results carry the sign of x and are floats. Note that has a different call/return pattern than its C equivalents: it takes a single argument and return a pair of values, rather than returning its second return value through an ‘output parameter’ (there is no such thing in Python). Return the IEEE 754-style remainder of x with respect to y. For finite x and finite nonzero y, this is the difference , where is the closest integer to the exact value of the quotient . If is exactly halfway between two consecutive integers, the nearest even integer is used for . The remainder thus always satisfies . Special cases follow IEEE 754: in particular, is x for any finite x, and and raise for any non-NaN x. If the result of the remainder operation is zero, that zero will have the same sign as x. On platforms using IEEE 754 binary floating point, the result of this operation is always exactly representable: no rounding error is introduced. Return x with the fractional part removed, leaving the integer part. This rounds toward 0: is equivalent to for positive x, and equivalent to for negative x. If x is not a float, delegates to , which should return an value. For the , , and functions, note that all floating-point numbers of sufficiently large magnitude are exact integers. Python floats typically carry no more than 53 bits of precision (the same as the platform C double type), in which case any float x with necessarily has no fractional bits.\n\nReturn a float with the magnitude (absolute value) of x but the sign of y. On platforms that support signed zeros, returns -1.0. Return the mantissa and exponent of x as the pair . m is a float and e is an integer such that exactly. If x is zero, returns , otherwise . This is used to “pick apart” the internal representation of a float in a portable way. Note that has a different call/return pattern than its C equivalents: it takes a single argument and return a pair of values, rather than returning its second return value through an ‘output parameter’ (there is no such thing in Python). Return if the values a and b are close to each other and otherwise. Whether or not two values are considered close is determined according to given absolute and relative tolerances. If no errors occur, the result will be: . rel_tol is the relative tolerance – it is the maximum allowed difference between a and b, relative to the larger absolute value of a or b. For example, to set a tolerance of 5%, pass . The default tolerance is , which assures that the two values are the same within about 9 decimal digits. rel_tol must be nonnegative and less than . abs_tol is the absolute tolerance; it defaults to and it must be nonnegative. When comparing to , is computed as , which is for any nonzero and rel_tol less than . So add an appropriate positive abs_tol argument to the call. The IEEE 754 special values of , , and will be handled according to IEEE rules. Specifically, is not considered close to any other value, including . and are only considered close to themselves. Return if x is neither an infinity nor a NaN, and otherwise. (Note that is considered finite.) Return if x is a positive or negative infinity, and otherwise. Return if x is a NaN (not a number), and otherwise. Return . This is essentially the inverse of function . Return the floating-point value steps steps after x towards y. If x is equal to y, return y, unless steps is zero.\n• None goes up: towards positive infinity.\n• None goes down: towards minus infinity.\n• None goes towards zero.\n• None goes away from zero. Return the value of the least significant bit of the float x:\n• None If x is a NaN (not a number), return x.\n• None If x is equal to zero, return the smallest positive denormalized representable float (smaller than the minimum positive normalized float, ).\n• None If x is equal to the largest positive representable float, return the value of the least significant bit of x, such that the first float smaller than x is .\n• None Otherwise (x is a positive finite number), return the value of the least significant bit of x, such that the first float bigger than x is . ULP stands for “Unit in the Last Place”. See also and .\n\nReturn e raised to the power x, where e = 2.718281… is the base of natural logarithms. This is usually more accurate than or . Return e raised to the power x, minus 1. Here e is the base of natural logarithms. For small floats x, the subtraction in can result in a significant loss of precision; the function provides a way to compute this quantity to full precision: With one argument, return the natural logarithm of x (to base e). With two arguments, return the logarithm of x to the given base, calculated as . Return the natural logarithm of 1+x (base e). The result is calculated in a way which is accurate for x near zero. Return the base-2 logarithm of x. This is usually more accurate than . returns the number of bits necessary to represent an integer in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros. Return the base-10 logarithm of x. This is usually more accurate than . Return x raised to the power y. Exceptional cases follow the IEEE 754 standard as far as possible. In particular, and always return , even when x is a zero or a NaN. If both x and y are finite, x is negative, and y is not an integer then is undefined, and raises . Unlike the built-in operator, converts both its arguments to type . Use or the built-in function for computing exact integer powers. Changed in version 3.11: The special cases and were changed to return instead of raising , for consistency with IEEE 754.\n\nReturn the Euclidean distance between two points p and q, each given as a sequence (or iterable) of coordinates. The two points must have the same dimension. Return an accurate floating-point sum of values in the iterable. Avoids loss of precision by tracking multiple intermediate partial sums. The algorithm’s accuracy depends on IEEE-754 arithmetic guarantees and the typical case where the rounding mode is half-even. On some non-Windows builds, the underlying C library uses extended precision addition and may occasionally double-round an intermediate sum causing it to be off in its least significant bit. For further discussion and two alternative approaches, see the ASPN cookbook recipes for accurate floating-point summation. Return the Euclidean norm, . This is the length of the vector from the origin to the point given by the coordinates. For a two dimensional point , this is equivalent to computing the hypotenuse of a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem, . Changed in version 3.8: Added support for n-dimensional points. Formerly, only the two dimensional case was supported. Changed in version 3.10: Improved the algorithm’s accuracy so that the maximum error is under 1 ulp (unit in the last place). More typically, the result is almost always correctly rounded to within 1/2 ulp. Calculate the product of all the elements in the input iterable. The default start value for the product is . When the iterable is empty, return the start value. This function is intended specifically for use with numeric values and may reject non-numeric types. Return the sum of products of values from two iterables p and q. Raises if the inputs do not have the same length. For float and mixed int/float inputs, the intermediate products and sums are computed with extended precision.\n\nThe mathematical constant π = 3.141592…, to available precision. The mathematical constant e = 2.718281…, to available precision. The mathematical constant τ = 6.283185…, to available precision. Tau is a circle constant equal to 2π, the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its radius. To learn more about Tau, check out Vi Hart’s video Pi is (still) Wrong, and start celebrating Tau day by eating twice as much pie! A floating-point positive infinity. (For negative infinity, use .) Equivalent to the output of . A floating-point “not a number” (NaN) value. Equivalent to the output of . Due to the requirements of the IEEE-754 standard, and are not considered to equal to any other numeric value, including themselves. To check whether a number is a NaN, use the function to test for NaNs instead of or . Example: Changed in version 3.11: It is now always available. CPython implementation detail: The module consists mostly of thin wrappers around the platform C math library functions. Behavior in exceptional cases follows Annex F of the C99 standard where appropriate. The current implementation will raise for invalid operations like or (where C99 Annex F recommends signaling invalid operation or divide-by-zero), and for results that overflow (for example, ). A NaN will not be returned from any of the functions above unless one or more of the input arguments was a NaN; in that case, most functions will return a NaN, but (again following C99 Annex F) there are some exceptions to this rule, for example or . Note that Python makes no effort to distinguish signaling NaNs from quiet NaNs, and behavior for signaling NaNs remains unspecified. Typical behavior is to treat all NaNs as though they were quiet.

        "document": "In the python noise module there are a few parameters that affect what you see when you generate your perlin noise:\n• scale: number that determines at what distance to view the noisemap.\n• octaves: the number of levels of detail you want you perlin noise to have.\n• lacunarity: number that determines how much detail is added or removed at each octave (adjusts frequency).\n• persistence: number that determines how much each octave contributes to the overall shape (adjusts amplitude).\n\nWe won’t worry about scale too much, you can use it to zoom out (bigger scale) or in (smaller scale).\n\nPerlin noise combines multiple functions called ‘octaves’ to produce natural looking surfaces. Each octave adds a layer of detail to the surface. For example: octave 1 could be mountains, octave 2 could be boulders, octave 3 could be the rocks.\n\nLacunarity of more than 1 means that each octave will increase it’s level of fine grained detail (increased frqeuency). Lacunarity of 1 means that each octave will have the sam level of detail. Lacunarity of less than one means that each octave will get smoother. The last two are usually undesirable so a lacunarity of 2 works quite well.\n\nPersistence determines how much each octave contributes to the overall structure of the noise map. If your persistence is 1 all octaves contribute equally. If you persistence is more than 1 sucessive octaves contribute more and you get something closer to regular noise (spoiler the regular noise image above is actually a perlin noise with a presistence of 5.0). A more default setting would be a presistance of less than 1.0 which will decrease the effect of later octaves.\n\nEnough chatting though! Let’s run some experiments. First let’s start with default perlin noise, and its accompanying image:\n\nThe way this perlin noise looks in our script is a 2D array of values between -1 and 1. The values that are darker on the map are lower values, the values that are close to 1 are lighter. What I want to try next is assigning two colors to different ranges of values in this map to produce some terrain:\n\nThis terrain map is pretty neat; it has jagged coasts, beaches, and lots of water. while I have never observed natural terrain that looks like this if we look at any one part of the map it seems ‘realistic.’ Let’s take it a step further and add mountains and snow:\n\nThis is cool but this terrain pattern is clearly not natural. To make it more natural we will use a circular filter to get rid of all the preipheral perlin noise:\n\nHere I was trying to create an island so I made a circular filter and then applied it to the color_world perlin noise array. What I ended up was a planet floating in an ocean. I changed the ocean color to black and it looks pretty cool! That said what I wanted was an island so let’s try again. This time we’re going to calculate a circular gradient and then apply that over the perlin noise as a filter.\n\nI struggled a lot with this part. I’m sure there is a more efficient way to get the gradient like this but the above was what I came up with. I calculated a distance metric from the center of the map and then normalized, shrunk, and renomalized those distances to produce this spherical gradient. Again lighter means the value is closer to 1, darker colors are closer to 0. Next I apply this circular gradient to the perlin noise we created before.\n\nThis part was less tricky but still a pain. I multiply the perlin noise by the circle gradient and then I increase the contrast by multiplying positive (lighter values) by 20. Then I renormalize to make it 0–1 again.\n\nThis is really cool and it looks like a much more natural archipelago. I encourage you to try different shading methods and maybe randomly removing some sections. I’m going to change the threshold value and set it as . That will produce a smaller but more realistic archipelago as so:\n\nThere we are! We have a natural looking island archipelago! So now that we have our islands you may notice that no matter how often you rerun this script perlin noise will produce the same islands. To get new islands you can set the parameter of the pnoise2 function to a random integer number, let’s try :"

        "document": "In the realms of computer graphics, gaming, and animation, \"noise\" holds a special significance, shaping realistic textures, terrains, and immersive landscapes. From classic video games to cutting-edge simulations, the concept of Perlin Noise revolutionized how we approach procedural generation, influencing how environments are built, how textures are mapped, and how movement feels organic in virtual worlds. Whether you're new to noise algorithms or delving into Simplex Noise as an alternative, understanding these concepts and their implementation opens up a realm of creative possibilities.\n\nPerlin Noise, developed by Ken Perlin in 1983, is a type of gradient noise widely used for simulating natural-looking textures and phenomena. Ken Perlin, an innovator in procedural graphics, developed this algorithm during the production of Tron, which marked a significant milestone in the world of CGI. Perlin Noise generates visually smooth, natural-looking patterns, making it a mainstay in procedural generation, particularly for terrain and organic textures. Its mathematical foundation lies in generating gradients across a grid and interpolating them, which distinguishes it from \"white noise,\" where each point is entirely random and lacks continuity.\n\nHow Perlin Noise Works: A Brief Overview of the Algorithm\n\nPerlin Noise operates by taking a coordinate point (often in 2D or 3D) and mapping it to gradients, calculating a weighted average based on each gradient's direction and strength relative to the point. This process involves key mathematical components, such as dot products, linear interpolation, and gradient vectors. The dot product is especially central to Perlin Noise, determining the contribution of each gradient direction to the final noise value.\n\nThe magic of Perlin Noise lies in its ability to smoothly transition between points, avoiding sharp, unrealistic changes that would otherwise make textures appear choppy or unnatural.\n\nWhy Perlin Noise is Popular in Graphics and Game Design\n\nKen Perlin’s noise function became a game-changer because it efficiently creates organic-looking randomness that feels natural to the human eye. This capability allowed for more complex textures, animations, and entire terrains to be procedurally generated in games, movies, and simulations. In applications such as Minecraft, for example, Perlin Noise enables the seamless creation of vast, believable landscapes, enhancing the user’s immersion in the virtual world.\n\nA Perlin Noise algorithm begins with a grid of gradient vectors that each point in random directions. Each coordinate point on this grid is evaluated for noise by taking into account its relative position to the grid’s surrounding gradient points. By combining a sequence of dot products and interpolations, Perlin Noise achieves smooth, blended transitions across the surface.\n• Calculating dot products between each gradient vector and the vector pointing from the grid intersection to the input coordinate.\n• Interpolating these dot products to produce the final noise value.\n\nOptimization in Perlin Noise can be achieved by using \"octaves\" — stacking multiple noise layers at different frequencies and amplitudes to produce a richer texture. Lower frequencies provide broad, slow changes, while higher frequencies add fine details. This technique can be adapted by adding layers, adjusting the frequency, and reducing the computation by storing gradient values in an array rather than recalculating them dynamically.\n\nPerlin Noise is ideal for creating natural textures like clouds, water, and landscapes. By adjusting parameters, you can simulate waves, rolling hills, and even mountain ranges. In texture synthesis, Perlin Noise offers an approach to avoid repetition, as each coordinate produces a unique, smooth value that avoids the uniformity of tileable textures.\n\nApplications of Perlin Noise in Game Environments and Landscapes\n\nMany games, including Minecraft and Terraria, leverage Perlin Noise for procedurally generated terrain. For example, by varying amplitude and frequency, developers can define mountainous regions, plains, and valleys, contributing to the distinct, visually coherent worlds players can explore.\n\nIn addition to terrain, Perlin Noise can define biomes, generate weather patterns, and even create animated visual effects like fire, smoke, and flowing water. Procedurally generated caves and dungeons also benefit from Perlin Noise, providing an endless variety of configurations.\n\n\n\nSee CG Matter’s application of Blender’s Perlin Noise based Noise Texture node here:\n\n\n\nWhat is Simplex Noise and How Does it Differ from Perlin Noise?\n\nSimplex Noise, also created by Ken Perlin, is an improvement over classic Perlin Noise, particularly in higher dimensions. Unlike the grid structure of Perlin Noise, Simplex Noise operates within a \"simplex,\" which is a geometric shape (like a triangle in 2D or a tetrahedron in 3D). This approach reduces computation and visual artifacts, especially in four dimensions and beyond.\n\nSimplex Noise is efficient and less computationally intensive for complex applications, such as 4D textures in simulations. It requires fewer resources by covering space more compactly than a grid, making it faster and more flexible for real-time applications, like animated textures and fluid simulations.\n\nWhen to Use Simplex Noise Over Perlin Noise\n\nSimplex Noise is preferable for applications requiring low-latency noise generation or work in high-dimensional spaces, such as volumetric clouds or fluid dynamics. Its reduced grid complexity and smoother transitions make it especially suited for dynamic or complex scenes.\n\n\n\nSee Blogize’s comparison between Perlin and Simplex Noise here:\n\nTips for Working with Perlin and Simplex Noise\n\nControl over parameters like frequency, amplitude, and octaves is essential to achieving a realistic or stylistic effect. Increasing frequency adds details, while adjusting amplitude impacts how dramatic these details appear. Lower frequencies produce broader, more gradual changes ideal for natural terrains, while higher values are useful for fine textures like grass or rocky surfaces.\n\nA popular technique involves layering multiple noise functions, each with different frequencies and amplitudes, to create detailed and realistic textures. By layering Perlin or Simplex Noise with other forms, you can achieve natural-looking details, whether for wood grains, clouds, or animated fire.\n\nArtifacts can arise from improper interpolation or aliasing in Perlin Noise. Techniques like adjusting interpolation methods or using a higher-resolution grid can reduce these effects, producing smoother results.\n\nSee The Coding Train’s seminar on generating 3D Terrain with Perlin Noise:\n\n\n\nThe procedural generation powered by Perlin and Simplex Noise remains a core component of world-building in gaming. These noise functions produce limitless landscapes, level variations, and organic animations, enhancing player immersion and reducing asset creation costs.\n\nUse of Perlin and Simplex Noise in Data Visualization and Simulations\n\nOutside of gaming, these noise functions help simulate natural phenomena in scientific visualization, from fluid dynamics to cloud patterns. In data visualization, Perlin Noise can smooth transitions in heat maps or population distributions, creating a more digestible presentation of data.\n\nThe Role of Noise in Generative Art and Creative Coding\n\nNoise-based algorithms have grown popular in generative art, where they inspire unique, mathematical patterns for digital canvases. Using parameters such as octaves and amplitude, artists create visually engaging and organic shapes that serve as foundations for abstract art, making noise an essential tool for creative coders.\n\nWith Perlin Noise, Ken Perlin not only pioneered procedural textures and generation techniques but also sparked an entirely new approach to visual realism in computer graphics. Whether building immersive worlds, visualizing data, or creating generative art, understanding and harnessing the power of Perlin and Simplex Noise continues to open doors to innovation in the digital arts."
