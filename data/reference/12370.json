Knowing how to do things can get tricky, and sometimes it‚Äôs hard to find the right answer. Not to worry. We‚Äôve put together the best practices along with examples to clarify any doubts you may have.\n‚Ä¢ Leverage TypeScript for Enhanced Safety: Utilize TypeScript with React to benefit from static typing which enhances code safety, predictability, and developer productivity by catching errors at compile time.\n‚Ä¢ Configure TypeScript Efficiently: Start with a robust `tsconfig.json` setup, enabling options like `strict`, `noEmit`, and `esModuleInterop` to enforce best practices and simplify handling modules and compilation.\n‚Ä¢ Integrate ESLint and Prettier: Set up ESLint with the TypeScript parser and Prettier for consistent code formatting. This helps maintain code quality and consistency, especially in team environments.\n‚Ä¢ Utilize TypeScript with Hooks: Take advantage of TypeScript‚Äôs capabilities to infer types in React Hooks for cleaner and safer code. Use generics and union types to handle complex state logic.\n‚Ä¢ Type Props and State Accurately: Define component props and state using TypeScript interfaces or types to ensure components receive the correct data, enhancing the component‚Äôs reliability and maintainability.\n‚Ä¢ Adopt Best Practices for Project Setup: Use the Create React App with TypeScript template for initial setup to quickly start projects with sensible defaults and build configurations optimized for TypeScript.\n\nHow React and TypeScript Work Together\n\nBefore we begin, let‚Äôs revisit how React and TypeScript work together. React is a ‚ÄúJavaScript library for building user interfaces‚Äù, while TypeScript is a ‚Äútyped superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.‚Äù By using them together, we essentially build our UIs using a typed version of JavaScript.\n\nThe reason you might use them together would be to get the benefits of a statically typed language (TypeScript) for your UI. This means more safety and fewer bugs shipping to the front end.\n\nA common question that‚Äôs always good to review is whether TypeScript compiles your React code. The way TypeScript works is similar to this interaction:\n\nTS: ‚ÄúHey, is this all your UI code?‚Äù\n\n React: ‚ÄúYup!‚Äù\n\n TS: ‚ÄúCool! I‚Äôm going to compile it and make sure you didn‚Äôt miss anything.‚Äù\n\n React: ‚ÄúSounds good to me!‚Äù\n\nSo the answer is yes, it does! But later, when we cover the settings, most of the time you‚Äôll want to use . What this means is TypeScript will not emit JavaScript out after compilation. This is because typically, we‚Äôre just utilizing TypeScript to do our type-checking.\n\nThe output is handled, in a CRA setting, by . We run and bundles the output for production.\n\nTo recap, TypeScript compiles your React code to type-check your code. It doesn‚Äôt emit any JavaScript output (in most scenarios). The output is still similar to a non-TypeScript React project.\n\nCan TypeScript Work with React and webpack?\n\nYes, TypeScript can work with React and webpack. Lucky for you, the webpack documentation has a guide on that.\n\nHopefully, that gives you a gentle refresher on how the two work together. Now, on to best practices!\n\nWe‚Äôve researched the most common questions and put together this handy list of the most common use cases for React with TypeScript. This way, you can use this article as a reference in your own projects.\n\nOne of the least fun, yet most important parts of development is configuration. How can we set things up in the shortest amount of time that will provide maximum efficiency and productivity? We‚Äôll discuss project setup including:\n\nThe quickest way to start a React/TypeScript app is by using with the TypeScript template. You can do this by running:\n\nThis will get you the bare minimum to start writing React with TypeScript. A few noticeable differences are:\n\nThe is for ‚ÄúTypeScript JSX‚Äú. The is the TypeScript configuration file, which has some defaults set. The references the types of , and helps with things like allowing for SVG imports.\n\nLucky for us, the latest React/TypeScript template generates for us. However, they add the bare minimum to get started. We suggest you modify yours to match the one below. We‚Äôve added comments to explain the purpose of each option as well:\n\nThe additional recommendations come from the react-typescript-cheatsheet community and the explanations come from the Compiler Options docs in the Official TypeScript Handbook. This is a wonderful resource if you want to learn about other options and what they do.\n\nIn order to ensure that your code follows the rules of the project or your team, and the style is consistent, it‚Äôs recommended you set up ESLint and Prettier. To get them to play nicely, follow these steps to set it up.\n‚Ä¢ Create a file at the root and add the following:\n‚Ä¢ Create a file at the root and add the following:\n\nThese recommendations come from a community resource written called ‚ÄúUsing ESLint and Prettier in a TypeScript Project‚Äù, by Robert Cooper. If you visit this resource, you can read more about the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind these rules and configurations.\n\nWe‚Äôve added ESLint and Prettier and the next step to improve our DX is to automatically fix/prettify our code on save.\n\nFirst, install the ESLint extension and the Prettier extension for VS Code. This will allow ESLint to integrate with your editor seamlessly.\n\nNext, update your Workspace settings by adding the following to your :\n\nThis will allow VS Code to work its magic and fix your code when you save. It‚Äôs beautiful!\n\nThese suggestions also come from the previously linked article ‚ÄúUsing ESLint and Prettier in a TypeScript Project‚Äù, by Robert Cooper.\n\nNote: to read more about , look here, and read here for .\n\nOne of the core concepts of React is components. Here, we‚Äôll be referring to standard components as of React v16.8, meaning ones that use hooks as opposed to classes.\n\nIn general, there‚Äôs much to be concerned with for basic components. Let‚Äôs look at an example:\n\nNotice the key difference here. In the first example, we‚Äôre writing our function as a function declaration. We annotate the return type with because that‚Äôs what it returns. In contrast, the second example uses a function expression. Because the second instance returns a function, instead of a value or expression, we annotate the function type with for React ‚ÄúFunction Component‚Äù.\n\nIt can be confusing to remember the two. It‚Äôs mostly a matter of design choice. Whichever you choose to use in your project, use it consistently.\n\nThe next core concept we‚Äôll cover is props. You can define your props using either an interface or a type. Let‚Äôs look at another example:\n\nWhen it comes to types or interfaces, we suggest following the guidelines presented by the community:\n‚Ä¢ ‚Äúalways use interface for public API‚Äôs definition when authoring a library or 3rd-party ambient type definitions.‚Äù\n‚Ä¢ ‚Äúconsider using type for your React Component Props and State, because it is more constrained.‚Äù\n\nYou can read more about the discussion and see a handy table comparing types vs interfaces here.\n\nLet‚Äôs look at one more example so we can see something a little bit more practical:\n\nIn this component, we use a type for our props. Each prop has a short description listed above it to provide more context to other developers. The after the prop named indicates that it‚Äôs optional. The prop takes a because it accepts everything that‚Äôs a valid return value of a component (read more here). To account for our optional prop, we use a default value when destructuring it. This example should cover the basics and show you have to write types for your props and use both optional and default values.\n\nIn general, keep these things in mind when writing your props in a React and TypeScript project:\n‚Ä¢ Always add descriptive comments to your props using the TSDoc notation .\n‚Ä¢ Whether you use types or interfaces for your component props, use them consistently.\n‚Ä¢ When props are optional, handle appropriately or use default values.\n\nLuckily, the TypeScript type inference works well when using hooks. This means you don‚Äôt have much to worry about. For instance, take this example:\n\nTypeScript infers the values given to use by the hook. This is an area where React and TypeScript just work together and it‚Äôs beautiful.\n\nOn the rare occasions where you need to initialize a hook with a null-ish value, you can make use of a generic and pass a union to correctly type your hook. See this instance:\n\nThe other place where TypeScript shines with Hooks is with , where you can take advantage of discriminated unions. Here‚Äôs a useful example:\n\nThe beauty here lies in the usefulness of discriminated unions. Notice how has a union of two similar-looking objects. The property is a string literal. The difference between this and a type is that the value must match the literal string defined in the type. This means your program is extra safe because a developer can only call an action that has a key set to or .\n\nAs you can see, Hooks don‚Äôt add much complexity to the nature of a React and TypeScript project. If anything, they lend themselves well to the duo.\n\nThis section is to cover the most common use cases where people stumble when using TypeScript with React. We hope by sharing this, you‚Äôll avoid the pitfalls and even share this knowledge with others.\n\nOne of the most common cases is correctly typing the used on an input field in a form. Here‚Äôs an example:\n\nSometimes you want to take component props declared for one component and extend them to use them on another component. But you might want to modify one or two. Well, remember how we looked at the two ways to type component props, types or interfaces? Depending on which you used determines how you extend the component props. Let‚Äôs first look at the way using :\n\nIf you declared your props using an , then we can use the keyword to essentially ‚Äúextend‚Äù that interface but make a modification or two:\n\nBoth methods solve the problem. It‚Äôs up to you to decide which to use. Personally, extending an interface feels more readable, but ultimately, it‚Äôs up to you and your team.\n\nYou can read more about both concepts in the TypeScript Handbook:\n\nWhether it‚Äôs for a GraphQL client like Apollo or for testing with something like React Testing Library, we often find ourselves using third-party libraries in React and TypeScript projects. When this happens, the first thing you want to do is see if there‚Äôs a package with the TypeScript type definitions. You can do so by running:\n\nFor instance, if you‚Äôre using Jest, you can do this by running:\n\nThis would then give you added type-safety whenever you‚Äôre using Jest in your project.\n\nThe namespace is reserved for package type definitions. They live in a repository called DefinitelyTyped, which is partially maintained by the TypeScript team and partially the community.\n\nShould these be saved as or in my ?\n\nThe short answer is ‚Äúit depends‚Äù. Most of the time, they can go under if you‚Äôre building a web application. However, if you‚Äôre writing a React library in TypeScript, you may want to include them as .\n\nThere are a few answers to this on Stack Overflow, which you may check out for further information.\n\nWhat happens if they don‚Äôt have a @types package?\n\nIf you don‚Äôt find a package on npm, then you essentially have two options:\n\nThe first option means you create a file based on the package name and put it at the root. If, for instance, we needed types for our package , then we could create a basic declaration file called at the root:\n\nThis won‚Äôt provide you type safety but it will unblock you.\n\nA more thorough declaration file would be where you add types for the library/package:\n\nIf you‚Äôve never written a declaration file, then we suggest you take a look at the guide in the official TypeScript Handbook.\n\nUsing React and TypeScript together in the best way takes a bit of learning due to the amount of information, but the benefits pay off immensely in the long run. In this article, we covered configuration, components, props, hooks, common use cases, and third-party libraries. Although we could dive deeper into a lot of individual areas, this should cover the 80% needed to help you follow best practices.\n\nIf you‚Äôd like to see this in action, you can see this example on GitHub.\n\nIf you‚Äôd like to get in touch, share feedback on this article or chat about using the two technologies together, you can reach me on Twitter @jsjoeio.\n\nIf you‚Äôd like to dive deeper, here are some resources we suggest:\n\nA lot of these recommendations came straight from the react-typescript-cheatsheet. If you‚Äôre looking for specific examples or details on anything React-TypeScript, this is the place to go. We welcome contributions as well!\n\nAnother fantastic resource is the TypeScript Handbook. This is kept up to date by the TypeScript team and provides examples and an in-depth explanation behind the inner workings of the language.\n\nDid you know you can test out React with TypeScript code right in the browser? All you have to do is import React. Here‚Äôs a link to get you started.\n\nRead our guide on practical ways to advance your TypeScript skills to set yourself up for continuous learning as you move forward.\n\nCan you use React with TypeScript? es, you can absolutely use React with TypeScript. In fact, combining React with TypeScript has become increasingly popular in the web development community. TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that provides enhanced tooling and type safety, making it an excellent choice for building robust and maintainable React applications.\n\nWhen using React with TypeScript, you typically create React components as TypeScript classes or functional components with TypeScript function signatures. TypeScript allows you to define strong types for props and state, reducing the risk of runtime errors and making your codebase more predictable. Additionally, TypeScript‚Äôs autocompletion and type checking in modern code editors provide valuable assistance during development.\n\nTo start a React project with TypeScript, you can use tools like Create React App with TypeScript template or manually configure TypeScript in an existing React project. With TypeScript, you can enjoy the benefits of static typing while building dynamic and interactive user interfaces with React, resulting in more reliable and maintainable web applications. Is TypeScript necessary for React? No, TypeScript is not necessary for building React applications, but it can be highly beneficial. React was originally developed using JavaScript (ECMAScript), and many React applications are still written in plain JavaScript. React works seamlessly with JavaScript, and you can create fully functional and efficient React applications without TypeScript.\n\nHowever, TypeScript can provide significant advantages when working with React. TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript, which means it adds type annotations and checking to JavaScript code. These type annotations can catch type-related errors at compile-time, offering improved code quality and maintainability. TypeScript can make large and complex React codebases more manageable by providing type safety for props, state, and function parameters, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors.\n\nIn summary, TypeScript is not a requirement for React, and you can use React effectively with plain JavaScript. However, TypeScript can enhance your development experience by adding type checking and improving code predictability, making it a valuable choice for building robust and maintainable React applications, especially in larger and more complex projects. How to use TypeScript in React apps? Start by setting up a new React project with TypeScript. You can use tools like Create React App with TypeScript template or manually configure TypeScript in an existing React project. \n\nNext, write your React components using TypeScript. You can create functional components with TypeScript function signatures or use TypeScript classes for class components. TypeScript allows you to specify prop types and state types, providing strong type checking and autocompletion support in code editors. If you‚Äôre using third-party libraries or packages in your React app, make sure to install TypeScript type definitions for those dependencies. Many popular libraries have community-maintained TypeScript type declarations available on DefinitelyTyped What Is the difference between React.js and React TypeScript? The primary distinction between React.js and React TypeScript is the choice of programming language used for development.\n\nReact.js (JavaScript): React.js, commonly referred to as React, is a JavaScript library designed for building user interfaces. When using React.js, developers typically write their applications in plain JavaScript, often leveraging modern JavaScript features such as ES6 and ES7. One notable characteristic of React.js is that it doesn‚Äôt enforce strict typing by default. As a result, developers rely on runtime checks and tools like PropTypes for type validation and error detection.\n\nReact TypeScript: React TypeScript, on the other hand, involves the use of TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript, in React application development. With React TypeScript, developers write their React components using TypeScript‚Äôs syntax. This approach offers a significant advantage: static type checking during development. TypeScript empowers developers to define types and interfaces for props, state, and other data, which can catch type-related errors at compile-time rather than runtime. This leads to improved code quality, enhanced code predictability, and a reduction in runtime errors.\n\nIn summary, React.js is the JavaScript library for building user interfaces, while React TypeScript is the same library but integrated with TypeScript to provide enhanced type safety and development support. The choice between React.js and React TypeScript depends on project requirements, developer preferences, and the importance of static typing for a particular application. Both options are valid and widely used in the development of web applications and user interfaces. Starting a React project with TypeScript or JavaScript depends on various considerations.\n\nBeginning with TypeScript: Starting with TypeScript can be advantageous when you prioritize strong type safety and improved development tooling. TypeScript‚Äôs static type checking helps catch errors at compile-time, leading to more robust and maintainable code. If you‚Äôre working on a sizable or complex project, TypeScript can be particularly beneficial in preventing bugs and making the codebase easier to manage. TypeScript also provides enhanced code documentation through type definitions, which can improve code readability and collaboration within your team.\n\nOpting for JavaScript: Choosing JavaScript may be more suitable for smaller projects or when you‚Äôre working under tight deadlines. JavaScript is more lightweight and has a shorter learning curve, making it quicker to set up and get started. If your team lacks experience with TypeScript or if the project requirements don‚Äôt necessitate strong typing, JavaScript might be a pragmatic choice. Additionally, the JavaScript ecosystem boasts an extensive collection of libraries and resources, making it easier to find solutions and support for your project."

This tech document outlines the best practices to follow when using ReactJS with TypeScript. These practices aim to enhance code quality, maintainability, performance, and overall development experience.\n\nEnable strict mode in the TypeScript configuration to enforce strict type checking and catch potential errors at compile-time. This can be done by setting in the file.\n\n\n\nAlways provide type annotations for component props and state to ensure type safety and improve code readability. Use interfaces or types to define the shape of props and state objects.\n\n\n\nPrefer functional components over class components whenever possible. Use React hooks (e.g., , ) to manage state and lifecycle behavior in functional components.\n\n\n\nTake advantage of TypeScript's utility types to simplify common type transformations. Utility types like , , , and can be used to modify and compose types efficiently.\n\n\n\nAvoid using the type as much as possible. Instead, provide explicit types or use union types to handle cases where the type can be more than one possibility.\n\n\n\nUse custom types to represent different error states in asynchronous operations. This allows for more expressive error handling and ensures the proper handling of error cases.\n\n\n\nCreate generic components to enhance reusability and type safety. Generic components can handle different data types while maintaining type checking at compile-time.\n\n\n\nAvoid using type assertions ( ) unless absolutely necessary. Instead, leverage TypeScript's type inference capabilities and provide explicit types to ensure type safety.\n\n\n\nFollow consistent naming conventions for components, props, and variables. Use meaningful and descriptive names to improve code readability and maintainability.\n\n\n\nPrefer third-party libraries that provide TypeScript support and type definitions. TypeScript support ensures better integration with your codebase and helps catch potential issues early on.\n\nEnsure that the installed types match the library version and use the correct import statements to import types from the library.\n\n\n\nTo optimize ReactJS applications, consider the following techniques:\n‚Ä¢ Use the Higher Order Component (HOC) to memoize functional components and prevent unnecessary re-renders.\n‚Ä¢ Utilize the hook to memoize event handlers and prevent unnecessary re-creation of functions.\n‚Ä¢ Use the hook to memoize expensive computations and avoid redundant calculations.\n\nConsider using the following component design patterns to structure your ReactJS\n‚Ä¢ Container-Component Pattern: Separate container components (smart components) responsible for handling data and business logic from presentational components (dumb components) responsible for rendering UI elements.\n‚Ä¢ Render Prop Pattern: Use the render prop pattern to share code and data between components by passing a function as a prop that returns JSX.\n‚Ä¢ Higher-Order Component (HOC) Pattern: Use HOCs to add additional functionality or modify behavior of existing components.\n‚Ä¢ Provider Pattern: Use React context API to provide data and state to multiple components without prop drilling.\n\nWhen handling events that can trigger frequent updates (e.g., scroll, resize), consider using debounce or throttle techniques to optimize performance and prevent excessive updates.\n\n\n\nUse conditional rendering techniques to control the visibility and behavior of components based on certain conditions. This can be achieved using conditional statements, ternary operators, or logical && operator.\n\n\n\nFollow the principle of immutability when updating state or props. Avoid directly mutating objects or arrays, as it can lead to unexpected behavior. Instead, create new copies of objects or arrays using immutable techniques like spread operators or immutable libraries.\n\n\n\nBy following these best practices, you can enhance your ReactJS with TypeScript projects, improve code quality, maintainability, and performance, and leverage the full potential of these technologies. Remember to adapt these practices based on your project's specific needs and requirements."
