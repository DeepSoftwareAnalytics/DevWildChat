        "document": "Mastering margins means gaining control over the following:\n• User Experience: Well-placed margins guide the eye and create a sense of order, preventing your design from feeling cramped or overwhelming.\n• Responsiveness: Margins play a crucial role in ensuring your website adapts seamlessly to different screens – desktops, tablets, and phones alike.\n• Professionalism: A polished website with consistent spacing is instantly recognizable, signaling attention to detail.\n\nWhether you’re a web design veteran or new to CSS, Elementor offers powerful tools to simplify and streamline your margin styling and layout workflow.\n\nWhat Are Margins in CSS?\n\nMargins create invisible space around your website elements. Think of a picture frame: the photo is your content, and the frame around it is the margin.\n\nMargins keep elements like paragraphs, images, headers, and sections from bumping up against each other, ensuring your website design has room to breathe. They’re fundamental to achieving a polished and professional layout.\n\nWith Elementor, you have incredible control over margins. You can visually adjust the size of the space around your elements, making those design tweaks a breeze. But before we get into the how-tos, let’s dig a little deeper into the nitty-gritty of margins.\n\nNow, margins might seem similar to their cousin, padding, but there’s a big distinction:\n• Margins are the transparent space outside your element’s border.\n• Padding is the space within the element’s border.\n\nImagine an envelope. The margin is the space between the envelope and other letters in the mailbox. The padding is the space between the address on the letter and the edges of the envelope. Mastering both margins and padding gives you precise control over the layout of your website.\n\nThe CSS Box Model is like a blueprint for how elements are built on a webpage. It has three key layers:\n• Content: The actual text, images, or videos within the element.\n• Padding: The space inside the border, as we learned.\n• Margin: The transparent space outside the border.\n\nUnderstanding this helps you visualize how margins interact with other layout elements. When working with elements in Elementor, you can often see visual representations of the box model, making it super intuitive to play with margins alongside other properties.\n\nNow, let’s break down how you actually control margins in CSS. You’ve got four main properties at your disposal:\n• margin-top: Sets the space above the element.\n• margin-right: Sets the space to the right of the element.\n• margin-bottom: Sets the space below the element.\n• margin-left: Sets the space to the left of the element.\n\nHere’s where Elementor makes life so much easier – instead of writing out individual margin properties, you often have visual sliders or input boxes to adjust each direction independently. This lets you see the results immediately, making it so much faster to get that perfect layout.\n\nLet’s move on to something that saves you a bunch of typing – shorthand!\n\nThe margin property is shorthand for setting all four sides at once. Here’s the order of values and what they control:\n• One value: Applies the same margin to all four sides (e.g., margin: 20px;)\n• Two values: The first value sets the top and bottom margins, the second the left and right (e.g., margin: 10px 30px;)\n• Three values: The first value is the top margin, the second is for the left and right, and the third is for the bottom (e.g., margin: 20px 15px 10px;)\n• Four values: Clockwise from top: top, right, bottom, left (e.g., margin: 10px 20px 30px 15px;)\n\nShorthand saves you a ton of code, making your CSS cleaner and leaner. And guess what? Elementor understands this shorthand! It’s often the default way to tweak margins in the visual editor.\n\nCSS gives you tons of flexibility in how you express your margin sizes. Here are the most common units you’ll use:\n• Pixels (px): The most straightforward unit, pixels offer fixed-size margins. Want a margin exactly 20 pixels wide? Go for it!\n• Percentages (%): This is where things get responsive! Percentage margins are based on the width of the element’s parent container. So, margin-left: 10%; creates a left margin 10% as wide as the element it’s within.\n• em: This unit is relative to the font size of the element. An em value of 1 would be equal to the current font size. This is handy for spacing that scales nicely with text.\n• rem: Similar to em, but relative to the root element’s font size. This offers consistency if you need margins to scale across your whole website layout.\n• Viewport units (vh, vw): These are based on the browser window’s size. 1vh equals 1% of the viewport height. This is great for full-screen effects.\n\nElementor usually lets you select your preferred unit from a dropdown menu when styling margins. This visual approach helps even if you need to become more familiar with the different units of measurement.\n\nOne of the most fundamental uses of margins is to create consistent spacing between various elements on your website. For example, use a margin at the bottom to give your paragraphs some breathing room or add space between images in a gallery for a clean layout. Evenly spaced-elements make your website look organized and professional.\n\nElementor simplifies this immensely. You can often adjust spacing directly on the visual canvas or use precise margin controls to get the exact pixel values you desire.\n\nWant to center a block of content horizontally? That’s where margin: auto comes to the rescue! Here’s how it works:\n• Set the left and right margins to auto.\n\nThe browser then calculates equal amounts of space on both sides, pushing your element right into the middle. This technique works for centering images, text blocks, and even whole sections of your layout.\n\nBut what about centering vertically? That’s a bit trickier with pure CSS, but Elementor’s visual controls often provide dedicated centering options to save you time!\n\nGrids are the backbone of many web designs. Margins play a critical role in defining the columns and gutters (the spaces between columns) of your grid system.\n\nFor instance, you might have a 12-column grid where each column has a percentage-based width and a fixed margin-right to create spacing between columns.\n\nElementor often has pre-built grid and column structures, making this layout fundamental and super easy to implement visually. However, understanding the underlying CSS margin principles will help you customize and troubleshoot your layouts effectively.\n\nNegative margins are your ticket to creating eye-catching overlapping effects in your web designs. By giving an element a negative margin (e.g., margin-top: -20px;), you essentially pull it upwards, causing it to overlap with the element above it.\n\nThis technique can be used to add depth to your layouts, create layered image compositions, or have sections partially cover each other for a dynamic appearance.\n\nElementor may not always give you visual negative margin controls, but you can input negative values directly. This gives you the freedom to experiment and achieve those unique layout effects.\n\nMargins are your best friend when it comes to fine-tuning how images align with surrounding text. For example, let’s say you want to wrap text around a left-aligned image. Give the image a margin-right to push the text away, while a bit of margin-bottom adds space below to prevent the text from bumping up against the image’s bottom edge.\n\nVertical alignment is also possible. For example, if you want to center a small icon vertically next to a block of text, setting the icon’s margin-top and margin-bottom to auto can help achieve that centered look.\n\nBuckle up because margin collapsing is one of those CSS behaviors that can trip you up if you’re not prepared. Here’s the gist:\n• The Basic Idea: In certain situations, adjacent vertical margins (think top and bottom) can “collapse” into a single margin. The collapsed margin ends up being as big as the larger of the two original margins.\n• Common Scenario: If you have two sibling elements (like paragraphs), both with top and bottom margins, the bottom margin of the top element and the top margin of the bottom element may collapse.\n\nThis might seem strange, but it’s designed to prevent overly large gaps in specific scenarios. Understanding margin collapsing helps you debug layouts where your spacing seems off unexpectedly.\n\nHow to Work with Margin Collapsing\n\nNow, you have several ways to deal with collapsing margins:\n• Embrace it: If the collapsing behavior gives you the desired spacing, awesome!\n• Prevent it: Adding even the tiniest bit of padding or border to an element stops its margins from collapsing with those of its neighbors.\n• Overflow: Setting overflow: auto on a parent element can sometimes prevent collapsing.\n\nElementor’s visual controls often try to handle margin collapsing behind the scenes. However, there might be times when you want to override it – knowing the CSS tricks will come in handy!\n• Block-level elements: These naturally take up the full available width, starting on a new line (e.g., paragraphs, headings, divs).\n• Inline elements: These exist within a line of text and only take up as much width as they need (e.g., links, images by default).\n\nWhy does this matter for margins? Here’s the deal:\n• Inline elements: Traditional top and bottom margins have little to no effect. But you can still control their horizontal spacing with left and right margins.\n\nKnowing this distinction helps avoid getting frustrated when the margins you set on inline elements seem to disappear! Elementor will adjust its controls based on the type of element you’re styling, making this more intuitive to manage.\n\nFlexbox is a powerful CSS layout mode that gives you incredible control over how elements arrange themselves within a container. Margins play nicely with Flexbox, but it’s worth understanding some key concepts:\n• Flex Direction: By default, flex items line up in a row (flex-direction: row). When that’s the case, horizontal margins (left and right) control spacing between the items as you’d expect. You can change the flex-direction to the column, and then it’s the vertical margins (top and bottom) that control spacing.\n• Justify-content: This property controls how items are spaced along the main axis of your flex container. You can use justify-content: space-between to spread items out evenly or justify-content: center to center them within the container. Margins will work in conjunction with this spacing.\n• Align-items: This property aligns items along the cross-axis (the axis perpendicular to the main axis). For example, in a row-based Flexbox layout, align-items: center would center items vertically. This can interact with vertical margins in interesting ways.\n\nElementor’s Flexbox controls are often very visual—you can drag and drop to rearrange items, adjust spacing, and align things visually. This makes experimenting with margins a seamless experience, even if you’re not a CSS guru.\n\nCSS Grid is another fantastic layout tool that works beautifully with margins. Here’s the gist:\n• Grid Columns & Gutters: When you define your grid, you can use margins to create the gutters (spacing) between columns. Similarly, margins can control the spacing between rows.\n• Grid Items: You can use margins directly on grid items to add space around them within their grid cell. However, any margin that extends beyond the grid cell’s edge will effectively be clipped.\n\nElementor can visually create grids and adjust gutter sizes without having to write the CSS margin properties yourself. However, knowing these concepts helps you fine-tune your grid layouts and understand how Elementor is translating your visual choices into code.\n\nPercentage-based margins give you fluid layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. Remember, margin percentages are calculated based on the width of the element’s containing block.\n\nHere’s why this is awesome: if a container gets smaller, the percentage-based margins will shrink in proportion, keeping your design from breaking on smaller viewports.\n\nThere’s a caveat: if margins are based on an element’s width, and that element’s width is also percentage-based… things can get a bit unpredictable. It’s good practice to make sure at least one element in the chain has a predictable width for percentage margins to reference.\n\nMedia queries are your best friends when it comes to fine-tuning margins across different screen sizes or device types. Here’s a quick refresher:\n• You define breakpoints (e.g., @media (max-width: 768px) – this targets screen widths smaller than 768 pixels).\n• Inside the media query, you write CSS rules that apply only when that breakpoint is active.\n\nYou have a three-column layout that looks great on desktops. On smaller screens, you might use a media query to reduce the margins between columns or even change the layout using Flexbox or Grid properties to make things stack nicely.\n\nElementor gives you a fantastic visual way to manage this: you often have responsive controls (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile) to tweak margins for each specific view size. This saves you from manually writing lots of media queries!\n\nElementor puts a strong emphasis on making responsive design a breeze. Many margin controls will be visually responsive by default. You’ll see icons for desktop, tablet, and mobile views, allowing you to modify values and instantly see how your design adapts.\n\nThis simplifies crafting layouts that look amazing on all devices. Of course, you can always explore custom CSS and media queries through Elementor’s settings if you need extra fine-grained control!\n\nIf you’re familiar with the traditional margin-top, margin-right, etc., get ready for their more logically-minded siblings:\n• margin-block-start: Equivalent to margin-top in left-to-right writing systems but adapts to languages with different writing directions.\n\nWhy the change? These logical properties promote internationalization and accessibility. Your margins automatically adapt based on language and text flow without requiring you to change your CSS every time.\n\nElementor may or may not expose these logical properties directly in its visual interface. However, knowing they exist (and how they translate to traditional properties) gives you a better understanding of the CSS it may be generating under the hood.\n\nEven seasoned web developers sometimes need help with weird margin problems. This is where your browser’s developer tools shine bright!\n• Inspect Element: Right-click on an element and select “Inspect” (the wording might vary slightly between browsers). This will open up your developer tools.\n• The Box Model View: The panel usually contains a visual representation of the box model, including the margin area (often highlighted in a distinct color).\n• Inspecting Styles: You can see all the CSS rules affecting that element, including how margins are being calculated and potentially even spots where margin collapsing might be happening unexpectedly.\n\nUsing these tools is a skill in itself, but mastering them gives you X-ray vision into your layouts! Even within Elementor, having this knowledge helps you identify issues Elementor might be introducing and work around them effectively.\n\nSadly, not all browsers render margins identically. While the differences are much smaller than in the wild old days of the web, there might be times you need to tweak margins for specific browsers.\n\nNumerous resources can help identify known compatibility issues. For bleeding-edge functionality, using browser prefixes for experimental margin features (e.g.,—webkit-margin-start) may occasionally be necessary.\n\nOne of the joys of using Elementor is its user-friendly interface for styling margins. Instead of digging through lines of CSS code, you often have options like:\n• Visual Sliders: Drag sliders to tweak margins on each side of an element, and you’ll see the results live in your design.\n• Linked/Unlinked Values: Control whether all margin sides change in unison or adjust them individually.\n• Units Toggle: Switch between pixels, percentages, em, and other units with a quick dropdown selection.\n\nThis approach makes experimenting with margins fast and intuitive, especially for those without deep CSS knowledge.\n\nElementor’s Theme Builder allows you to set global margin styles throughout your website, which can be immensely valuable for ensuring consistency.\n\nFor example, within the Theme Builder, define a default spacing for all your paragraphs or headings. Changes here will cascade through your site, saving you the hassle of tweaking margins on individual pages. Of course, you can always override those defaults with Elementor when needed for specific elements.\n\nLet’s wrap up this section with some tips that get the most out of margins within the Elementor ecosystem:\n• Embrace Visual Controls: When possible, use Elementor’s sliders, toggles, and responsive controls for margin adjustments. It’s faster than hand-coding CSS and less prone to mistakes.\n• Theme Builder Power: Use the Theme Builder to establish spacing guidelines and create site-wide consistency.\n• Avoid Excessive Overrides: While individual element overrides are useful, only a few can make your CSS bloated. Try achieving the desired layouts with more general styling through the Theme Builder.\n• Preview Performance: Elementor’s Preview mode gives you a sense of how your margins impact real-world loading speeds.\n\nIt’s crucial to remember that only some website visitors experience layouts in the same way. Here’s how margins tie into web accessibility:\n• Sufficient Whitespace: Ensure enough spacing around text elements for readability. This is especially important for users with visual impairments or cognitive disabilities.\n• Focus States: When a user navigates your website using a keyboard, elements in focus should have a visual indicator (often an outline). Use margins to make sure this outline doesn’t overlap content awkwardly.\n• Screen Readers: Screen reader software helps users with visual impairments navigate websites. Well-structured layouts with appropriate spacing between elements make the content easier for screen readers to parse and present in a logical order.\n\nElementor provides some accessibility features, but it’s your responsibility as the designer to use margins responsibly! Keep sufficient whitespace and make sure your design doesn’t break when a browser’s default focus styles are applied.\n\nBrowsers have default stylesheets that include basic margins and padding values for many elements. Sometimes, these defaults can interfere with the styling you want to achieve. Here’s where a “margin reset” might be useful:\n• What it does: A CSS reset is a set of rules that overrides browser defaults, giving you a cleaner slate. Some resets target margins specifically, removing them from various elements like headings or lists.\n• Pros: It can help achieve consistency across browsers if their default margins vary too much.\n• Cons: Often heavy-handed, as you may need to add back margins you do want.\n\nElementor, with its theme building and global settings, lessens the need for manual margin resets. Still, knowing the concept is valuable, especially if you troubleshoot strange margin behavior caused by a reset included elsewhere in your stylesheets.\n\nThe Future of Margins in CSS\n\nWhile margins are a core CSS concept that isn’t going away anytime soon, there might be interesting developments on the horizon:\n• Container Queries: This much-anticipated CSS feature (still under development) would allow you to style elements based on the size of their parent container, not just the overall viewport. This could create powerful new ways to work with margins at a component level.\n• Logical Properties Gaining Ground: As browsers continue to improve, expect to see a stronger adoption of margin-block and margin-inline properties, which will promote internationalization and flexibility in layout design.\n• Gap Property: Used in Flexbox (the gap between flex items) and Grid (row-gap, column-gap), the gap property streamlines spacing. It could influence how we think about traditional margins in certain scenarios.\n\nIt’s impossible to predict the exact future, but staying aware of these features indicates the continued focus on powerful and intuitive layout controls in CSS. Elementor, being actively maintained, will likely keep pace with new developments, making your margin styling even more powerful as these features become mainstream.\n\nThroughout this in-depth exploration, we’ve discovered the essential role margins play in crafting polished and responsive web designs. From the fundamentals of the box model to advanced techniques like logical properties, you’re now equipped with the knowledge to use margins with precision and confidence.\n\nWhether you’re a seasoned web developer or just starting, understanding margins opens a world of possibilities:\n• Achieve cleaner layouts: Mastering margins allows you to create structured, visually pleasing designs that are easy for your visitors to navigate.\n• Boost responsiveness: By strategically using percentage-based margins and media queries, you can ensure your layouts look fantastic on screens of all sizes.\n• Enhance accessibility: Using margins responsibly contributes to a more inclusive web experience for all users.\n\nRemember, Elementor provides a user-friendly and powerful toolkit for working with margins. Its visual interface, theme-building capabilities, and optimized hosting environment make it easier than ever to achieve the layouts you envision."

        "document": "In this tutorial, you’ll learn the difference between CSS margins and padding and how these properties affect the space between elements on a web page. We’ll also discuss margin collapsing, the effect of using different units while creating responsive websites, and conclude with some layout tricks you can do with CSS margins and padding.\n• Understanding the CSS Box Model is crucial as elements in CSS are represented as a rectangular box, the size of which is determined by the element’s content, padding, border, and margin.\n• Box sizing is a common stumbling block for CSS beginners. The default setting of ‘box-sizing: content-box’ means padding and borders are added to the width and height set for an element, often causing confusion. A common solution is to set boxes to ‘box-sizing: border-box’.\n• CSS allows control over the padding and margin applied to the four sides of an element. Padding surrounds the element’s content, while margin is the external layer, creating space between the element and its surrounding elements.\n• Interesting uses of margins and padding include centering elements within their parents, using margin to space elements apart, and maintaining image aspect ratios. Understanding these techniques can help solve a number of layout-related issues.\n\nElements in CSS are represented as a rectangular box. The size of this rectangular box is determined by the element’s:\n\nThe content area of an element lies in the middle of the element. The padding surrounds the element’s content. The borders surround the padding. The margin of the element is its external layer: that is, it lies outside the element.\n\nThe following diagram should make the arrangement clearer.\n\nBox sizing is one of the first things to trip up CSS beginners. It’s common to see two elements sitting side by side, and it’s natural to expect that, if they both have a width of , they should be able to fit within their container. But it’s confusing when they don’t.\n\nBy default, if we set a width on an element and then add padding and/or borders left or right, the overall width of the element grows. That is, any padding or border is added to the overall width of the element. So if our elements also have left/right padding and/or border, they are wider than 50%.\n\nThe W3C box model defaults to as setting of . This means that padding and borders are added to the width and height we’ve set for an element. Generally speaking, this default makes page layout quite difficult, as we have to think about more than just the width we set for elements.\n\nIt’s often much more convenient to set a width on an element and know that any padding and border we set on the element will be included in that width measurement. To ensure this is the case, we can set our boxes to . That way, we don’t have to worry about our elements getting too big for their layout.\n\nIt’s not uncommon to see CSS resets applying to all elements:\n\nNote: there are simpler resets than this, but this one makes it easier to change your mind if you do want an element to have a different box sizing.\n\nYou can read more about box sizing on MDN or in the box-sizing specification.\n\nIf you learn best by doing, try experimenting with this fun interactive demo by Guy Routledge.\n\nHow to Set Padding in CSS\n\nWe can control the padding applied to the four sides of an element using the , , and properties. We can also specify the padding using the shorthand property.\n\nWhen a single padding value is present, CSS uses this value to determine the padding of all four sides:\n\nWhen two values are present, the first value determines the top and bottom padding and the second value determines the left and right padding:\n\nWhen three values are present, the first value determines the top padding, the second value determines the left and right padding and the third value determines the bottom padding:\n\nWhen all four values are present, they set the top, right, bottom and left padding in this exact order:\n\nThe padding examples above are shown in the following CodePen demo. Each box has a blue background and a white border.\n\nAll elements in the demo above are set to . If you comment out that setting in the Pen above, you’ll see the boxes get bigger, since the padding is added to the overall width and height of the boxes.\n\nHow to Set Margin in CSS\n\nJust like with padding, we can control the margin applied to the four sides of an element using the , , and properties. We can also specify the margin for all the four sides of an element using the shorthand margin property:\n\nMargins serve to create space between elements. In the demo below, each box is floated left and the first two have a value.\n\nThings to Keep in Mind about Margin and Padding\n\nLet’s look at some useful things to keep in mind when using margin and padding.\n\nUsing the right units\n\nWhen applying margins and padding, think carefully about whether or not you want to use absolute units (such as pixels). This is because these units won’t adapt to the changes in font size or screen width.\n\nLet’s say you have set the width of an element to and also applied a margin of on it. At , its width would be and its margin would be . At , its width would be and its margin would still be .\n\nIn this case, the width of the element has changed by 36% but its margin still has the same old value. In most cases, this might not be a big deal. However, setting the element’s margin in terms of percentages will allow you to have finer control over the layout of the webpage on all screen sizes. This way you can make everything proportional without any sudden jumps in the value of applied margins and padding.\n\nSimilarly, you may want to add padding to text elements on a web page. Generally, you would like the padding to be proportional to the font size of the corresponding element. This can’t be achieved with absolute units. However, if the padding is specified in terms of units, it will automatically scale with the font size. Here is a demo that shows this scaling in action.\n\nHow browsers compute margin and padding values for different units\n\nBrowsers compute the final margin and padding values for an element differently based on the unit being used.\n\nAny margin or padding that has been specified as a percentage is calculated based on the width of the containing element. This means that padding of will be equal to when the parent element is wide, and it will be equal to when the parent element is wide. Remember that the top and bottom values are also calculated based on the width of the parent element.\n\nIn case of units, the computed value for margin and padding is based on the font size of the element. In the previous CodePen demo, the padding applied to the bottom three text elements is . However, the computed value of padding is different in each case because of the different font size.\n\nThere are also four different viewport based units called , , and . The computed value of margin and padding in this case is based on the viewport. For example, a padding of will be equal to when the viewport is wide and a padding of will be equal to for the same viewport width. You can read more about these units in CSS Viewport Units: A Quick Start on SitePoint.\n\nAs a beginner, knowing how these different units work can help you quickly figure out why the padding or margin of HTML elements is changing based on the parent element’s size, font size or even the viewport, which gives you the power to take control of your layout.\n\nAnother concept that you should be aware of is collapsing margins. In certain situations, the top and bottom margins on two elements can collapse into one. This phenomenon is called margin collapsing.\n\nLet’s say you have two elements side by side — that is, adjacent siblings. If the property on the first element is set to and the property on the second element is set to , the final margin between the two elements will not be . Its actual value will be equal to the value of the bigger margin — that is, .\n\nSimilarly, margins can also collapse between a parent element and its first/last child. This happens when there is no border, padding or inline content to separate the child’s and parent’s respective margins. In this case, if there’s no padding or border on the parent element, the child’s margin will look as if it were bleeding out of the parent.\n\nOne way to avoid this situation is to add a barrier between the parent’s margin and the child’s. This can be done by either using a border or a padding. The following demo shows how adding a border or padding on the parent element can avoid the bleeding margin.\n\nIn case of negative margins, the final value of the collapsed margins is the sum of the largest positive margin and the smallest negative margin.\n\nYou can read more on this topic in Collapsing Margins, by Adam Roberts.\n\nInteresting Uses of Margins and Padding\n\nSometimes, you can use CSS margin and padding properties to solve a number of layout related issues. Here are a few examples.\n\nCentering block-level elements horizontally inside their parent is very easy with the help of the margin property. All you have to do is set the value of the and properties of the element to :\n\nIn the following demo, you can see three instances of a parent element: the first one is set to be a block-level element, the second one to be an inline-block element, and the third one is a block-level element that has been floated to the right. The child element results to be centered horizontally in all cases.\n\nUsing margin to space elements apart\n\nA super cool (but often little-known) use of margins is to isolate elements from one another using margins. This is incredibly handy in many scenarios, such as when laying out Flexbox items. Take a look at the examples in the following CodePen demo.\n\nIn each case, we’re pushing one box away from the others using margin. This can be done with vertical spacing as well.\n\nFor more margin tips like this, check out Kevin Powell’s video on more amazing things you can do with auto margins.\n\nOften, the images on a web page do not have a fixed aspect ratio. If you have to show all images with the same aspect ratio, CSS padding can help.\n\nThe trick is to set the of the parent element to zero and its property to be equal to the value of the desired aspect ratio expressed as a percentage.\n\nFor example, an aspect ratio of 16:9 can be achieved by using . Here, the value 56.25 was obtained after calculating . The same method can be used to calculate the percentage of padding for any other aspect ratio.\n\nYou can read more about this technique on How to Maintain Image Aspect Ratios in Responsive Web Design, by Craig Buckler. You can also read about newer ways to maintain aspect-ratio in our article on the new CSS aspect-ratio property.\n\nOther interesting (though a bit more advanced) uses of margins and padding, include creating full-width containers inside limited width parents and adding consistent spacing at the bottom of different modules in a web page. You can consider these to be your next steps in mastering CSS margins and padding.\n\nIf you are new to CSS, we hope this tutorial has helped you understand the differences between margins and padding. You should also be comfortable setting margins and padding with the shorthand syntax and appropriate units. In the last section, we mentioned a few interesting layout-related uses of these properties and pointed you to further resources to find out more.\n\nTake your CSS skills to the next level with our book CSS Master, 3rd Edition by Tiffany B.

        "document": "Chrome is back at Google I/O on May 20-21! Register now\n\nSay you've got a collection of three boxes, stacked on top of each other and you want space between them. How many ways can you think of to do that in CSS?\n\nThe property might give you what you need, but it also might add additional spacing that you don't want. For example, how do you target just the space in between each of those elements? Something like might be more appropriate in this case. There are many ways to adjust spacing within a UI, each with its own strengths and caveats.\n\nHTML itself provides some methods to space elements. The and elements allow you to space elements in the block direction, which if you are in a latin-based language, is top-to-bottom.\n\nIf you use a element, it will create a line-break, just like if you were to press your enter key in a word processor.\n\nThe creates a horizontal line with space either-side, known as .\n\nAlong with using HTML elements, HTML entities can create space. An HTML entity is a reserved string of characters that are replaced with character entities by the browser. For example, if you were to type in your HTML file, it would be converted into a © character. The entity is converted into a non-breaking space character, which provides an inline space. Be careful though, because the non-breaking aspect of this character stitches the two elements together, which can result in odd behaviour.\n\nIf you want to add space to the outside of an element, you use the property. Margin is like adding a cushion around your element. The property is shorthand for , , and .\n\nThe shorthand applies properties in a particular order: top, right, bottom and left. You can remember these with trouble: TRouBLe.\n\nThe shorthand can also be used with one, two, or three values. Adding a fourth value lets you set each individual side. These are applied as follows:\n• One value will be applied to all sides. ( ).\n• Two values: the first value will be applied to the top and bottom sides, and the second value will be applied to the left and right sides. ( )\n• Three values: the first value is , the second value is and , and the third value is . ( ).\n\nMargin can be defined with a length, percentage or auto value, such as or . If you use a percentage, the value will be calculated based on the width of your element's containing block.\n\nThis means that if your element's containing block has a width of and your element has a value of : each side of your element will have a computed margin of .\n\nYou can also use a value of for margin. For block level elements with a restricted size, an margin will take up available space in the direction that it is applied to. A good example is this one, from the flexbox module, where the items push away from each other.\n\nAnother good example of margin is a horizontally centered wrapper which has a max width. This sort of wrapper is often used to create a consistent center column on a website.\n\nHere, margin is removed from the top and bottom (block) sides, and shares the space between the left and right (inline) sides.\n\nNegative values can also be used for margin. Instead of adding space between adjacent sibling elements, it will reduce space between them. This can result in overlapping elements, if you declare a negative value that's more than the available space.\n\nMargin collapse is a tricky concept, but it's something you'll run into very commonly when building interfaces. Say you have two elements: a heading and a paragraph that both have vertical margin on them:\n\nAt first glance, you would be forgiven for thinking that the paragraph will be spaced from the heading, because and combined calculate to . Because vertical margin collapses, though, the space is actually .\n\nMargin collapse works by selecting the largest value of two adjoining elements with vertical margin set on the adjoining sides. The bottom of the meets the top of the , so the largest value of the 's bottom margin and the 's top margin is selected. If the were to have of bottom margin, the space between them both would then be because that is larger than . Only block margins collapse, not inline (horizontal) margins.\n\nMargin collapse also helps with empty elements. If you have a paragraph that has a top and bottom margin of , it will only create of space: not . If anything is added to the inside of this element though, including , its margin will no longer collapse in itself and will be treated as any box with content.\n\nIf you make an element absolutely positioned, using , the margin will no longer collapse. The margin also won't collapse if you use the property, too.\n\nIf you have an element with no margin between two elements with block margin, the margin won't collapse either, because the two elements with block margin are no longer adjacent siblings: they are just siblings.\n\nIn the layout lesson, you learned that flexbox and grid containers are very similar to block containers, but handle their child elements very differently. This is the case with margin collapse, too.\n\nIf we take the original example from the lesson and apply flexbox with column direction, the margins are combined, instead of collapsed. This can provide predictability with layout work, which is what flexbox and grid containers are designed for.\n\nMargin and margin collapse can be tricky to understand, but understanding how they work, in detail, is very useful, so this detailed explainer is strongly recommended.\n\nInstead of creating space on the outside of your box, like does, the property creates space on the inside of your box instead: like insulation.\n\nDepending on which box model you are using—which was covered back in the box model lesson — can also affect the overall dimensions of the element too.\n\nThe property is shorthand for , , and . Just like , has logical properties, too: , , and .\n\nAlso covered in the layout module, if you set a value for that is anything other than , you can space elements with the , , and properties. There are some differences with how these directional values behave:\n• An element with will maintain its place in the document flow, even when you set these values. They will be relative to your element's position too.\n• An element with will base the directional values from the relative parent's position.\n• An element with will base the directional values on the viewport.\n• An element with will only apply the directional values when it is in its docked/stuck state.\n\nIn the logical properties module, you learn about the and properties, which allow you to set directional values that honor writing mode.\n\nBoth properties are shorthands combining the and values and as such accept either one value to be set for and or two individual values.\n\nLastly, in both grid and flexbox you can use the property to create space between child elements. The property is shorthand for and , it accepts one or two values, which can be lengths or percentages. You can also use keywords such as , and . If you define only one value, the same will be applied to both the rows and columns, but if you define both values, the first value is and the second value is .\n\nWith both flexbox and grid, you can also create space using their distribution and alignment capabilities, which we cover in the grid module and flexbox module.\n\nIt is a really good idea to choose a strategy and stick with it to help you create a consistent user interface that has good flow and rhythm. A good way to achieve this is use consistent measures for your spacing.\n\nFor example, you could commit to using as a consistent measure for all gaps between elements—known as gutters—so all layouts look and feel consistent. You could also decide to use as the vertical spacing between flow content, which would achieve consistent spacing based on the element's . Whatever you choose, you should save these values as variables (or CSS custom properties) to tokenize those values and make the consistency a bit easier.\n\nUsing custom properties like this allows you to define them once, then use them throughout your CSS. When they are updated, either locally within an element or globally, the values will pass down through the cascade and the updated values will be reflected."

        "document": "Forms are essential components of web design, serving as the primary means of interaction between users and web applications. Despite their importance, form elements often receive less attention in terms of styling. Properly styled forms enhance user experience, making them more engaging and easier to use. In this article, we will explore advanced techniques for styling form elements with CSS, turning ordinary forms into visually appealing and functional components of your website.\n\nStarting with basic styling, you can set the background color, border, padding, and font of input fields to match the overall design of your website.\n\nCustomizing the placeholder text enhances the user experience by making it more visually appealing and consistent with the input field styling.\n\nAdding focus and hover effects makes input fields more interactive and visually engaging. These effects provide visual feedback, indicating that the field is active or being interacted with.\n\nStyling specific input types, such as date pickers or file uploads, can be challenging but rewarding. Customizing these elements ensures a cohesive design throughout the form.\n\nSelect menus often have a default appearance that doesn’t match the rest of the form. Basic styling can make them look more integrated.\n\nCreating custom dropdown arrows can significantly improve the appearance of select menus, making them more visually appealing and consistent with the overall design.\n\nAdding hover and focus effects to select menus can make them more interactive, providing visual feedback to the user.\n\nTextareas often have a plain appearance by default. Basic styling can make them more appealing and easier to use.\n\nJust like input fields, you can style the placeholder text in textareas to match the overall design.\n\nAdding focus and hover effects to textareas makes them more interactive and visually appealing.\n\nButtons are critical for form interactions. Basic styling includes setting the background color, border, padding, and font.\n\nEnhance buttons with hover and active states to provide visual feedback when users interact with them.\n\nStyling disabled states for buttons ensures they are clearly distinguishable from active buttons.\n\nIncorporating icons into buttons can make them more intuitive and visually engaging.\n\nLabels are important for accessibility and form usability. Basic styling includes setting the font, color, and spacing.\n\nMaking labels interactive, such as changing their color when the associated input is focused, can enhance the user experience.\n\nGrouping related form elements together can make the form more organized and easier to navigate.\n\nRadio buttons and checkboxes often have a default appearance that can be customized to fit your design.\n\nCreating custom radio buttons involves hiding the default input and using a styled element to represent it.\n\nSimilar to radio buttons, custom checkboxes can be created by hiding the default input and styling an element to represent it.\n\nProviding clear and visually distinct error messages helps users understand what went wrong and how to fix it. Basic styling includes setting the font, color, and margin.\n\nHighlighting invalid fields with a border or background color helps users quickly identify where errors occurred.\n\nCustom validation styles can be applied to different states (valid, invalid, focus) to provide a consistent and clear user experience.\n\nAccessibility is crucial for ensuring that all users, including those with disabilities, can use your forms. Basic steps include using semantic HTML elements and ensuring keyboard navigability.\n\nUsing ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes can enhance the accessibility of your forms, providing additional information to assistive technologies.\n\nEnsuring that focus indicators are visible and clear helps users navigate forms using the keyboard.\n\nOrganizing form elements in a logical and visually appealing layout improves usability. Basic layout techniques include using flexbox or grid for alignment and spacing.\n\nCreating responsive form layouts ensures that forms are usable on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones. Using CSS grid can help create flexible and adaptive layouts.\n\nProper alignment of form elements can create a cleaner and more professional appearance. Using CSS flexbox allows for precise control over the alignment and spacing of form elements.\n\nAdding basic animations to form elements can make interactions more engaging and intuitive. Simple transitions can enhance the user experience without overwhelming them.\n\nAnimating placeholder text can guide users and provide a more dynamic interaction.\n\nEnhancing buttons with animations for hover and active states makes them more interactive and engaging.\n\nRange sliders allow users to select a value from a given range. Styling these elements can greatly enhance their usability and appearance.\n\nStarting with basic styles, you can set the appearance of the slider track and thumb.\n\nEnhancing the range slider with gradients, custom thumb styles, and transitions can make it more visually appealing.\n\nFile inputs are often visually unappealing by default. Customizing them can significantly improve their appearance and functionality.\n\nHiding the default file input and styling a label to act as the file input button is a common approach.\n\nEnhancing the file input with additional styles, such as icons and interactive states, can make it more user-friendly.\n\nFieldsets and legends are used to group related form elements. Proper styling can make these groups more visually cohesive and easier to navigate.\n\nApplying basic styles to fieldsets and legends can enhance their appearance and readability.\n\nEnhancing fieldsets and legends with additional styles, such as background colors and custom borders, can make them stand out.\n\nOffering light and dark themes for forms can enhance user experience by providing visual comfort in different lighting conditions.\n\nAdding a theme toggle switch allows users to switch between light and dark themes, enhancing their user experience.\n\nAccessible forms are crucial for all users, including those with disabilities. By following best practices and using appropriate HTML and CSS, you can make your forms more inclusive.\n\nUsing semantic HTML elements like and ensures that screen readers and other assistive technologies can interpret the form correctly.\n\nARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) landmarks and roles help define regions and elements in your form for assistive technologies.\n\nEnsuring that your forms are navigable by keyboard improves accessibility for users who rely on keyboard inputs.\n\nSwitches (toggle buttons) are commonly used for binary options. Customizing these controls can enhance their usability and appearance.\n\nCreating a basic switch involves hiding the default checkbox and styling a label to act as the switch.\n\nCustomizing checkboxes and radio buttons can make them more visually appealing and consistent with your design.\n\nReal-time validation provides immediate feedback to users, improving the form completion process. Styling validation messages and states can enhance usability.\n\nUsing JavaScript, you can provide more sophisticated real-time validation and feedback.\n\nSmooth transitions between form steps or sections can enhance the user experience, making forms feel more dynamic and engaging.\n\nUsing JavaScript, you can control the transitions and make the form more interactive.\n\nStyling form elements with CSS is essential for creating engaging and user-friendly web forms. By implementing advanced techniques such as custom input fields, accessible designs, real-time validation, and smooth transitions, you can significantly enhance the functionality and visual appeal of your forms. Focus on accessibility to ensure all users, including those with disabilities, can effectively interact with your forms.\n\nIntegrate custom styles for checkboxes, radio buttons, range sliders, and file inputs to maintain a cohesive design language. Utilizing JavaScript for advanced interactions and validations further enriches the user experience. With these techniques, you can transform standard forms into sophisticated, interactive, and accessible components that improve overall user satisfaction."

        "document": "In 1995, the HTML 2 specification introduced form controls (a.k.a. \"form widgets\", or \"form elements\"). But CSS wasn't released until late 1996, and wasn't supported by most browsers until years afterward; so, in the interim, browsers relied on the underlying operating system to render form widgets. Even with CSS available, browser vendors were reluctant at first to make form elements stylable, because users were so accustomed to the looks of their respective browsers. But things have changed, and forms widgets are now mostly stylable, with a few exceptions.\n\nCSS font and text features can be used easily with any widget (and yes, you can use with form widgets). However, browser behavior is often inconsistent. By default, some widgets do not inherit and from their parents. Many browsers use the system's default appearance instead. To make your forms' appearance consistent with the rest of your content, you can add the following rules to your stylesheet: The property value causes the property value to match the computed value of the property of its parent element; inheriting the value of the parent. The screenshots below show the difference. On the left is the default rendering of an , , , , , and a in Chrome on macOS, with the platform's default font style in use. On the right are the same elements, with our above style rule applied. The defaults differed in a number of ways. Inheriting should change their fonts to that of the parent's font family — in this case, the default serif font of the parent container. They all do, with a strange exception — does not inherit from the parent paragraph in Chrome. Rather, it uses the . This is another reason to use elements over their equivalent input types! There's a lot of debate as to whether forms look better using the system default styles, or customized styles designed to match your content. This decision is yours to make, as the designer of your site, or web application.\n\nAll text fields have complete support for every property related to the CSS box model, such as , , , , and . As before, however, browsers rely on the system default styles when displaying these widgets. It's up to you to define how you wish to blend them into your content. If you want to keep the native look and feel of the widgets, you'll face a little difficulty if you want to give them a consistent size. This is because each widget has its own rules for border, padding, and margin. To give the same size to several different widgets, you can use the property along with some consistent values for other properties: In the screenshot below, the left column shows the default rendering of an , , , , , , , , and . The right column on the other hand shows the same elements with our above rule applied to them. Notice how this lets us ensure that all of the elements occupy the same amount of space, despite the platform's default rules for each kind of widget. What may not be apparent via the screenshot is that the radio and checkbox controls still look the same, but they are centered in the 150px of horizontal space provided by the property. Other browsers may not center the widgets, but they do adhere to the space allotted.\n\nThe element is okay to style, but it can be a bit tricky to control the placement of it. By default, it is always positioned over the top border of its parent, near the top left corner. To position it somewhere else, for example inside the fieldset somewhere, or near the bottom left corner, you need to rely on the positioning. Take the following example: To position the legend in this manner, we used the following CSS (other declarations removed for brevity): The needs to be positioned too, so that the is positioned relative to it (otherwise the would be positioned relative to the ). The element is very important for accessibility — it will be spoken by assistive technologies as part of the label of each form element inside the fieldset — but using a technique like the one above is fine. The legend contents will still be spoken in the same way; it is just the visual position that has changed. Note: You could also use the property to help you with positioning your . However, when you position it with for example a , it moves but leaves an ugly gap in the border, which is not easy to get rid of.\n\nNow we can dig into the CSS for the example. Add all the code blocks shown below inside the element, one after another. First, we prepare by defining our rules, and all the basic styles set on the and elements. If the fontsquirrel output was different from what we described above, you can find the correct blocks inside your downloaded webfont kit, in the file (you'll need to replace the below blocks with them, and update the paths to the font files): Notice that we've used some CSS grid and Flexbox to lay out the form. Using this we can easily position our elements, including the title and all the form elements: Now we can start working on the form elements themselves. First, let's ensure that the s are given the right font: The text fields require some common rules. In other words, we remove their and , and redefine their and : When one of these fields gains focus, we highlight them with a light grey, transparent, background (it is always important to have focus style, for usability and keyboard accessibility): Now that our text fields are complete, we need to adjust the display of the single and multiple-line text fields to match, since they won't typically look the same using the defaults. elements default to being rendered as an inline-block element. The two important things here are the and properties. While our design is a fixed-size design, and we could use the property to prevent users from resizing our multi-line text field, it is best to not prevent users from resizing a textarea if they so choose. The property is used to make the field render more consistently across browsers. Some browsers default to the value , while some default to the value . In our case, it's better to be sure everyone will use : The element is really convenient to style with CSS; you can do whatever you want, even using pseudo-elements:"

        "document": "Forms are the building blocks that allow websites to interact with users. They collect information, from email addresses for subscriptions to feedback on software products, which is necessary for the websites to function. But a broken piece of form can be a real turn-off.\n\nIf a business form doesn’t work properly due to browser compatibility or other technical glitches, it can hurt the business by reducing sales or sign-ups and affecting its reputation. This is where Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) come to the rescue. CSS provides powerful tools for editing and customizing CSS form design elements. Styling elements of CSS form design allows developers to bridge the gap by integrating forms with the entire web design.\n\nThis blog will help you cover the styling elements of CSS form design. From text input and selection to checkboxes and radio buttons, we will explore different techniques and best practices, equipping you with the knowledge and skills to take form designs to the next level.\n\nOther than cross-browser compatibility, the rendering speed of a CSS form design also matters. This can directly affect a business by impacting user experience, conversion rates, and search engine rankings. A slow-loading form that is not properly styled can lead to frustration, lower conversions, and reduced online visibility.\n\nAnother good reason for styling forms is the (default) form elements that come with the native styles across different browsers. Each browser integrates the default form element styles separately, resulting in a fragmented user experience.\n\nAccording to SimilarWeb, the market share of Chrome is 63.39%, making it the most popular web browser. It is followed by Safari (21.04%), Edge (5.71%), Samsung Internet (3.42%), Firefox (2.59%), and others.\n\nWhile Chrome may have the highest market share, it’s also essential to consider users’ experience on other browsers. CSS form design styling elements are important for businesses because they help create a unified and visually appealing interface. Users’ trust and confidence in a brand increase when they see well-designed forms complementing the website’s aesthetics.\n\nThis, in turn, encourages more participation and increases the likelihood of completing the forms, whether submitting feedback, placing an order, or applying for a job. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure cross-browser compatibility of the elements of CSS form design while developing it for websites.\n\nBefore diving into the exciting world of CSS form design styling elements, it’s important to consider the prerequisites for achieving the desired results. Firstly, having a solid understanding of HTML and CSS will be helpful.\n\nYou should also be familiar with the basic structure and properties of CSS forms. This knowledge forms the foundation for customizing and styling form elements effectively. Depending on the level of control you require, you can take several approaches.\n\nOne common method is using CSS frameworks or libraries that provide pre-styled form components, which can be customized further to match the design. Another approach involves using CSS pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements to target specific elements of CSS form design and apply custom styles.\n\nSee the Pen \n\n CSS Form Design Tutorial – Custom Form Elements with CSS by Aakash Rao (@aakash_codes)\n\n on CodePen.\n\nCommon Issues With the Native Styles of the Form Elements\n\nA typical CSS form design includes text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and dropdown menus. However, it may appear differently across web browsers due to the default browser integration of the form elements.\n\nThis inconsistency can affect the overall user experience and make maintaining a cohesive design across different browsers challenging. With custom styling of the CSS form design elements, developers can overcome browser-specific quirks and inconsistencies in how form elements are displayed.\n\nAdding custom styling to CSS form design elements gives developers more control and flexibility over how they look and behave. Let’s explore some additional reasons why custom styling of the form elements is beneficial:\n• Consistent User Interface: Custom styling of form elements allows developers to achieve a consistent look and behavior, ensuring the forms maintain a unified user interface regardless of the user’s browser or device.\n• Accessibility: By applying specific styles to focused or active states, using appropriate color contrasts, focusing on CSS form design accessibility with internationalization and localization, and providing clear visual feedback, developers can enhance the usability of form elements for individuals with visual impairments or motor disabilities· Implementing these accessibility features benefits users with disabilities and enhances the overall user experience for everyone. Improved color contrasts make form elements easier to identify and interact with, even in different lighting conditions or on various devices. Design that is inclusive benefits all parties involved by making the digital space more accessible and welcoming·\n• Visual Hierarchy: The styling elements of CSS form design establish a visual hierarchy within the forms. You can use different colors, typography, and spacing to emphasize essential form elements, such as required fields or form submission buttons. This helps users understand the purpose and significance of each element.\n• Improved User Experience: Customizing the appearance can enhance the user experience by making your CSS form design more visually intuitive and easier to use. Custom styles can provide visual cues and feedback to guide users through the form-filling process·\n\nNow that we’ve explored some of the importance of styling the CSS form design elements, let’s now dive deeper into the custom styling of individual form elements.\n\nBy applying the magic of CSS, we can transform plain input fields, buttons, and more into visually pleasing elements that effortlessly blend with the website’s design.\n\nCreate the Base HTML for the Project\n\nNow that the starter HTML code is ready let’s look at how to reset the default styles applied by browsers.\n\nResetting the default styles applied by the browser allows developers to start with a clean slate and apply their own custom styles to achieve a consistent design across different browsers and platforms.\n\nYou can reset the styles of form elements with properties such as margin, padding, border, box-sizing, and background. As the starting point for applying all the elements, you can use the appearance: none; to remove the default borders and browser-specific appearances. To make sure that this property works on all different browsers, you can use the vendor prefix.\n\nA vendor prefix is a unique identifier for a particular browser appended to the property name in a special code. That prefix is -webkit- for Chrome, Safari, and more recent iterations of Edge and Opera. The -moz- prefix is used by Firefox.\n\nYou can notice the changes in the two examples above. We removed the default border, background, and other visual styles from the text input and textarea fields. We also hid the default checkbox and radio buttons for the checkbox and radio button elements.\n\nFor the <select> element (dropdown-list), the default dropdown arrow and styling were hidden, and the default button styles were removed. For the range slider the default styling of the range slider was hidden.\n\nAnother reset that is popularly used by all CSS developers is often referred to as CSS normalization or normalizing.\n\nIt helps to improve cross-browser consistency in the HTML element default styling of the browser’s user agent. Using the universal selector that matches any element on the webpage, we can add a basic normalization to reset the margin and padding to 0 and box-sizing with the value of border-box.\n\nYou can also use Normalize.css, a complete stylesheet containing all the styles for normalizing CSS. After resetting the styles, we can apply the custom styles to the form elements.\n\nLet’s start by setting some CSS variables for the theming of form elements.\n\nWe will use hsl(), one of the CSS color functions, which provides a more intuitive and flexible way to specify colors.\n\nYou can also use RGB colors, which add additive color mixing by combining different intensities of red, green, and blue light to create colors. I prefer to use HSL colors, as they allow developers to easily adjust hue, saturation, and lightness independently, resulting in greater control and simplicity in color manipulation.\n\nFor the base styles, you can use the HTML selector to reset the font size of the document to 62.5%. And to place the form container at the center, you can simply use the CSS Flexbox.\n\nNow that we’ve covered some base styles, let’s focus on the layout structure. We will use CSS Grid most, as it gives us the flexibility to define the size of columns to better control our layout structure.\n\nNow that our layout structure is ready with the spacing, we can finally work on adding the styles for our theme and the info container and its text.\n\nNow that we have our layout and base structure ready with the theme and background, let’s finally explore the styling of individual form elements.\n\nInput and textarea fields allow users to enter and submit textual information. They can be used for various purposes, such as collecting names, email addresses, passwords, or messages. Let’s explore how to apply styles to make them look consistent on different browsers.\n\nThe input fields text, email, and textarea—do not have any styles added yet. Let’s give those fields some styles to improve their appearance.\n\nOne important thing to notice here is that the textarea field is resizable. This can cause an issue when a user accidentally breaks the layout or structure of the form elements with a few clicks. This issue can be easily fixed using a simple property called resize by setting its value to none and giving a min-height to the textarea element.\n\nBefore setting the textarea to resize:\n\nAfter setting the textarea to resize:\n\nNow, let’s add some styles for the focused state for both the input and textarea fields.\n\nSee the Pen \n\n CSS Form Design Tutorial – Input and Textarea Fields by Aakash Rao (@aakash_codes)\n\n on CodePen.\n\nCheckboxes and radio buttons are common elements used in CSS form design. Checkboxes allow users to select multiple options from a list, whereas radio buttons allow users to select a single option.\n\nThese interactive controls visually represent choices and enable users to make selections easily. Styling them significantly changes the overall CSS form design. Let’s explore how to style them individually.\n\nStarting with the radio buttons – for now, they no longer have their default styling, such as the circular shape and the dot indicating selection.\n\nLet’s start with styles to bring the ring back by adding width, height, and border to the element and making the font and color inherit from the parent.\n\nYou can notice that we got our ring back for the radio input, but there is still one part missing: the circle inside the ring in the checked state. For that, we can use the ::before pseudo-element, and displays it when a user tries to check a radio.\n\nThe ::before pseudo-element is typically used to insert content before the content of an element. It creates an imaginary element that comes before the actual content of the selected element in the document tree.\n\nNow, we have the radio element perfectly looking with the custom theme required for the design. Let’s now add some styles to the radio element for the focused state using the :focus pseudo-class. Also, make the cursor pointer for the label of radio elements.\n\nMoving onto the checkbox element, first, we need to structure its label to make them look side by side since we have all our <label> elements set to display to block. We can achieve this with a CSS Grid and apply two columns to the checkbox container.\n\nNext, we can add some styles to bring back our checkbox element. We start by applying some specific resets, including inheriting the font styles to ensure em produces the desired sizing outcome and adding the border for our checkbox along with some border-radius.\n\nNext, to prepare for the incoming pseudo-element (checkbox-tick), you first need to change the display behavior of the input to use the grid since it’s the quickest way to make them align the ::before to the horizontal and vertical center of our custom control.\n\nIt’s time to bring in our ::before pseudo-element, which will be styled to represent the :checked state. We create the ::before element, including a transition, and use transform to hide it with scale(0).\n\nFinally, when the input is :checked, you can make it visible with scale(1) with a nicely animated result with the transition applied to the pseudo-element.\n\nAs you can notice, our :checked state inside the border looks square. For changing that shape into a checkmark, we can apply the clip-path property to define coordinates to redraw the shape.\n\nAs the last step, for the focused state of the checkbox and :checked state you can apply the same styles that we’ve applied earlier to our input and textarea fields.\n\nSee the Pen \n\n CSS Form Design – Radio and Checkbox by Aakash Rao (@aakash_codes)\n\n on CodePen.\n\nThe next element in our CSS form design is the slider for selecting the range. This element is used in this form for demonstration purposes, but you will find this element commonly used on media players, and eCommerce websites for selecting the price range or in the settings panel for changing the brightness or font size.\n\nIt enables users to select a value within a specified range by dragging a slider handle along a track. It also provides a visually interactive way for users to input numerical data or adjust within a defined range. Let’s learn how to add custom styles to change its look and blend it with the CSS form design.\n\nThis element is a little challenging for styling as it has some tweaks and aspects to explore. You can explore the differences in browser integration by looking inside the elements on different browsers.\n\nFor Chrome, you can do so by enabling the Show user agent shadow DOM option to explore its element implementation structure, as Chrome doesn’t allow us to see the Shadow DOM elements by default.\n\nShadow DOM is a web standard that allows developers to create encapsulated web components. It creates a hidden sub-section of the Document Object Model (DOM) attached to a specific element in the main DOM. This hidden DOM, called the Shadow DOM, has an internal structure and style separate from the rest of the page.\n\nWe can mainly divide its native structure into two parts:\n• Thumb: The draggable handle that indicates the current value of the slider. It is represented by a small draggable element, such as a circle or a rectangle.\n• Track: The track represents the entire range of values the slider can span. It is the area over which the thumb moves.\n\nSince it’s a native element, each browser has its own implementation. We can consider its two main different browser implementations. One is for WebKit and Blink browsers such as Chrome, Edge, Safari, and Opera, and the other is for Firefox.\n\nThere is another implementation for the IE browser, but we’re only going to focus on two main browser types for now. The primary challenge in styling arises from the necessity of providing unique styles for each implementation, driven by the inconsistencies present across different browsers.\n\nLet’s add styles to our main <input type=”range”> element. You can also declare some CSS custom properties or variables associated with this element.\n\nOnly the thumb is visible at this stage with its default styling, as shown in the image. We can start customizing those two elements (thumb and slider) of the range input to make it look good with the CSS form design. Starting with the thumb element for keeping it simple, let’s use <thumb> for now and understand the properties we’re trying to target.\n\nNow, you can replace that <thumb> with the actual selectors for different implementations of browsers, as we talked about earlier.\n\nNow, we will use a CSS trick to complete our slider. It involves using the border-image property.\n\nThe border-image property is the shorthand (border-image-outset, border-image-repeat, border-image-slice, border-image-source, border-image-width) to specify an image to be used as the border of an element instead of the regular solid color border. It can also be written as\n• border-image-source: Sets the source image used to create an element’s border image.\n• border-image-slice: Defines how the border image is divided into nine regions: corners, edges, and the center. It specifies the size of the border image slices and determines which parts of the image will be used as the border.\n• border-image-width: Sets the width of the border image area. It defines the size of the border area that will be filled with the border image.\n• border-image-outset: Specifies how much the border image area extends beyond the border box. It sets the outset or offset of the border image from the element’s border.\n• border-image-repeat: Determines how the border image is repeated or stretched to cover the border area if the image is smaller than the border box.\n\nSee the Pen \n\n Using border-image for range slider element by Aakash Rao (@aakash_codes)\n\n on CodePen.\n\nReturning to the actual form range slider element – the image will have a gradient of 2 colors — the main (defined by –color-accent variable) and a gray (defined by –input-border variable). We need the border image to cover the whole space of the input horizontally, so we use a big value for left and right widths (100vw) while we keep the top and bottom at (0).\n\nHowever, the border-image width is limited to the element size. To overcome this, we also need to use a large value for the border image outset to increase the space available for it.\n\nThe parts of the border image that are rendered outside the element’s border-box with border-image-outset do not trigger overflow scrollbars and don’t capture mouse events. When we first see the slider, it looks like we’re increasing the main color on the left, but in reality, we’re sliding a fixed gradient that’s overflowing our element.\n\nBy adding overflow: hidden to the input element, and using a big value for border-image-width and border-image-outset, we can create a perfect illusion.\n\nThe last step you need here is to decrease the size of the bar to match the size defined by the variable –line-thickness. For this, we’ll be using the clip-path property. It creates a clipping region that sets what part of an element should be shown. Parts inside the region are shown, while those outside are hidden.\n\nNow, you have our custom range slider element ready with a few lines of code that can be easily controlled by adjusting a few variables. Feel free to make some changes and add tweaks to understand the behavior of different properties.\n\nSee the Pen \n\n CSS Form Design Tutorial – Range Slider Element by Aakash Rao (@aakash_codes)\n\n on CodePen.\n\nThe <select> element is a fundamental HTML form element that allows users to choose an option from a dropdown menu. It presents users with a list of predefined options and enables them to select a single value. It provides a simple and intuitive way to gather user input, especially when there are multiple choices available.\n\nTaking a quick overview of the structure of <select> element, we have a <div> with a class of select that holds <select> with all the <option> elements.\n\nLet’s explore how to make our <select> element accessible and cross-browser compatible by adding some CSS style resets.\n\nNext, we will target the <div> with the class select that holds our main <select> element and apply styles.\n\nFor our dropdown arrow, we will use one of the most exciting modern CSS properties: clip-path. To create the arrow, we will define it as an ::after pseudo-element.\n\nFor now, our arrow is still not going to appear despite defining width and height. When inspected, it found that the ::after is not actually allowed its width. We will resolve this issue by updating our .select class with a CSS Grid layout.\n\nAt this stage, we can verify that we have certainly created a triangle. To fix the alignment, we’ll use the CSS Grid. First, we’ll define our area, then define the select and the ::after pseudo-element. The name is scoped to the element it was created for, and we’ll keep it easy by calling it arrow-place.\n\nThis gives us an overlap of the arrow above the native select due to stacking context via source order. We can quickly fix this by using the justify-self to horizontally place it to the (right) end.\n\nFinally, for the focus state, we can apply the styles by selecting the :focus state of <select> element and applying it to <span> with the class focus using the adjacent-sibling (+) selector. And for this, we will implement using the position: absolute.\n\nSee the Pen \n\n CSS Form Design Tutorial – Select Element by Aakash Rao (@aakash_codes)\n\n on CodePen.\n\nSubmit and reset buttons are common elements in web forms that facilitate user interactions. The submit button triggers the submission of form data to a server, while the reset button clears or resets the form. Styling these buttons is relatively simpler than other CSS form design elements.\n\nLet’s start with adding some styles for resetting these buttons.\n\nFor structuring the buttons we can apply flexbox for vertically centering and adding a gap between the two buttons. And for the visual styles of the buttons – we want to display the reset button similar to a link for which we can use the border-bottom property.\n\nSee the Pen \n\n CSS Form Design – Submit and Reset buttons by Aakash Rao (@aakash_codes)\n\n on CodePen.\n\nNow that we have our custom CSS form design ready with all the elements, it’s time to make our form layout responsive that adapts to different screen sizes and devices. We can achieve this by applying CSS media queries to set specific styles and layout rules based on the device’s characteristics, such as screen width.\n\nLet’s add some media queries styles to make the form layout responsive:\n\nNow to check the responsiveness of layout you can use browser developer tools, but there’s a better option like LT Browser with which you can check the responsiveness based on different screen sizes.\n\nLT Browser is a responsive testing tool for web developers and testers to test and debug how their websites look and function on various mobile device viewports. LT Browser comes with a lot of developer-friendly features that ease responsive testing such as\n• Use dedicated DevTools for different viewports.\n• Network throttling to test websites in different network conditions.\n\nLet’s start testing the CSS form design using the LT Browser to test on different device sizes:\n\nNow that we have tested the custom elements of the CSS form design project. It’s finally time to test our custom CSS form design elements across different browsers to check compatibility.\n\nAs discussed earlier, CSS form design elements may look different across web browsers due to their own integration of the form elements. This can affect the user experience and make it challenging to maintain a consistent design across different browsers.\n\nHowever, we can solve this issue with the custom styles of the CSS form design elements. By performing cross browser testing, we can ensure they look the same and are accessible across different browsers. You can also perform accessibility testing to ensure your CSS form designs are accessible to all users.\n\nWe can manually test the web forms using AI-powered test orchestration and execution platforms like LambdaTest which offers a remote test lab of 3000+ real environments. It allows developers to test websites in different browsers and operating systems.\n\nSubscribe to the LambdaTest YouTube Channel and stay updated with the latest tutorials around mobile app testing, real device cloud, and more.\n\nBy utilizing Real Time Browser Testing, you can test elements of CSS form design and identify any inconsistency or styling issues specific to particular browsers.\n\nBy now, we have almost covered every aspect with our custom styling of the form elements. But there is still one more important part we haven’t talked about which is the accessibility of forms.\n\nHow to Make Accessible Forms With Custom Form Elements?\n\nIn this section, we will explore some of the best practices for creating user-friendly and accessible CSS form designs. With these best practices, developers can enhance user experience, improve accessibility, and ensure that the forms work perfectly across different languages and devices.\n\nThe 3:1 contrast ratio rule is a WCAG Guideline that ensures sufficient visual contrast between the foreground and background colors of form controls, such as input fields, buttons, and labels, to ensure accessibility for visual impairments.\n\nTo ensure that the contrast ratio between the foreground and background colors of the input field and the submit button meets the 3:1 rule, we can use tools like the WebAIM Contrast Checker or any other online contrast ratio calculator. These tools analyze the color values and provide feedback on whether the contrast ratio meets the recommended level.\n\nTo ensure accessibility and provide clear labels for each form control, we use the element. Associating the label with its corresponding input field using the for attribute, which should match the input field’s ID. This association allows users to understand which label corresponds to which input field, even if they cannot visually perceive the label.\n\nIt also helps to provide transparent information about the purpose of each form field, especially for users relying on assistive technologies like screen readers.\n\nWhen a user encounters an error during form submission, it’s important to provide clear error messages or user notifications that are easy to locate. Displaying the error messages near the respective form controls or providing a summary of errors helps the user understand the issues with their submission and allows them to quickly identify and correct the errors.\n\nA simple approach to improving accessibility is to use the aria-describedby attribute on the form control that matches the id on the error message element. Then, use aria-live=”assertive” for the error message. ARIA live regions announce an error to screen reader users the moment the error is shown.\n\nInternationalization and localization play vital roles in web development, helping to create a global impact and enhance user experience. Internationalization (i18n) ensures the design and development of websites that adapt to various languages, data formats, currencies, and cultural preferences.\n\nIt involves character encoding, adapting layouts for text variations, and supporting multilingual content. On the other hand, localization (l10n) involves translating content, adapting images, and aligning functionality with local norms and regulations.\n\nLet’s explore how to craft CSS form design elements for internationalization and localization.\n\nTo ensure the form works smoothly in different languages, we can use attributes such as lang to specify the language of the form.\n\nAs per the WCAG Success Criterion 3.1.1, a page language needs to be specified in a way that may be programmatically determined. The WCAG Success Criterion 3.1.2 requires that pages with parts in different languages have the languages of those parts specified, too.\n\nBusinesses like Flipkart, which primarily operate in specific regions, prioritize localization to cater to their local customer base effectively. By adapting their websites, apps, and services to the language and preferences of each target market, they can offer a more personalized and seamless user experience.\n\nBy setting lang=”en” for English or using other language codes such as lang=”fr” for French or lang=”es” for Spanish, we indicate the language of the form content.\n\nTo ensure that the search engines and browsers know about the translated version, we can add <link> elements in the site’s <head> describing the alternate versions.\n\nSome languages, such as Arabic or Hebrew, are written from Right to Left (RTL) instead of Left to Right (LTR). To support RTL languages, we can apply the dir attribute to the form or specific form controls.\n\nBy setting dir=”rtl”, we ensure that the form elements are aligned correctly and provide a better user experience for users who read RTL languages.\n\nThe art of styling elements for CSS form design can elevate the overall user experience on the website. By understanding the fundamental concepts and techniques discussed, developers can easily transform boring and generic form elements into visually attractive and user-friendly components.\n\nIn this blog, we learned about the foundation of resetting and normalizing the default styles across different browsers to provide a consistent starting point for styling efforts. Then, by taking advantage of CSS pseudo-selectors such as pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements, we also learned to target specific form elements and apply custom styles.\n\nWe also discussed prioritizing cross-browser compatibility and accessibility, which helps us ensure that the custom styles work perfectly on all browsers and don’t hinder the functionality or readability of CSS form design elements for different users. We can create amazing user-friendly CSS form designs by applying these techniques and keeping user experience at the forefront of design decisions.\n\nSo go ahead, experiment, and unleash your creativity to style common form elements with CSS."
