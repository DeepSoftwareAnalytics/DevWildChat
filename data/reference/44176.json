        "document": "A string containing all ASCII characters that are considered whitespace. This includes the characters space, tab, linefeed, return, formfeed, and vertical tab.\n\nBy design, string.printable.isprintable() returns False . In particular, string.printable is not printable in the POSIX sense (see LC_CTYPE ).\n\nString of ASCII characters which are considered printable by Python. This is a combination of digits , ascii_letters , punctuation , and whitespace .\n\nString of ASCII characters which are considered punctuation characters in the C locale: !\"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~ .\n\nThe uppercase letters 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' . This value is not locale-dependent and will not change.\n\nThe lowercase letters 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' . This value is not locale-dependent and will not change.\n\nThe concatenation of the ascii_lowercase and ascii_uppercase constants described below. This value is not locale-dependent.\n\nConverts the value (returned by get_field() ) given a conversion type (as in the tuple returned by the parse() method). The default version understands ‘s’ (str), ‘r’ (repr) and ‘a’ (ascii) conversion types.\n\nformat_field() simply calls the global format() built-in. The method is provided so that subclasses can override it.\n\nImplement checking for unused arguments if desired. The arguments to this function is the set of all argument keys that were actually referred to in the format string (integers for positional arguments, and strings for named arguments), and a reference to the args and kwargs that was passed to vformat. The set of unused args can be calculated from these parameters. check_unused_args() is assumed to raise an exception if the check fails.\n\nIf the index or keyword refers to an item that does not exist, then an IndexError or KeyError should be raised.\n\nSo for example, the field expression ‘0.name’ would cause get_value() to be called with a key argument of 0. The name attribute will be looked up after get_value() returns by calling the built-in getattr() function.\n\nFor compound field names, these functions are only called for the first component of the field name; subsequent components are handled through normal attribute and indexing operations.\n\nThe args parameter is set to the list of positional arguments to vformat() , and the kwargs parameter is set to the dictionary of keyword arguments.\n\nRetrieve a given field value. The key argument will be either an integer or a string. If it is an integer, it represents the index of the positional argument in args; if it is a string, then it represents a named argument in kwargs.\n\nGiven field_name as returned by parse() (see above), convert it to an object to be formatted. Returns a tuple (obj, used_key). The default version takes strings of the form defined in PEP 3101 , such as “0[name]” or “label.title”. args and kwargs are as passed in to vformat() . The return value used_key has the same meaning as the key parameter to get_value() .\n\nThe values in the tuple conceptually represent a span of literal text followed by a single replacement field. If there is no literal text (which can happen if two replacement fields occur consecutively), then literal_text will be a zero-length string. If there is no replacement field, then the values of field_name, format_spec and conversion will be None .\n\nLoop over the format_string and return an iterable of tuples (literal_text, field_name, format_spec, conversion). This is used by vformat() to break the string into either literal text, or replacement fields.\n\nIn addition, the Formatter defines a number of methods that are intended to be replaced by subclasses:\n\nThis function does the actual work of formatting. It is exposed as a separate function for cases where you want to pass in a predefined dictionary of arguments, rather than unpacking and repacking the dictionary as individual arguments using the *args and **kwargs syntax. vformat() does the work of breaking up the format string into character data and replacement fields. It calls the various methods described below.\n\nThe primary API method. It takes a format string and an arbitrary set of positional and keyword arguments. It is just a wrapper that calls vformat() .\n\nThe built-in string class provides the ability to do complex variable substitutions and value formatting via the format() method described in PEP 3101 . The Formatter class in the string module allows you to create and customize your own string formatting behaviors using the same implementation as the built-in format() method.\n\nThe method and the class share the same syntax for format strings (although in the case of , subclasses can define their own format string syntax). The syntax is related to that of formatted string literals, but it is less sophisticated and, in particular, does not support arbitrary expressions.\n\nFormat strings contain “replacement fields” surrounded by curly braces . Anything that is not contained in braces is considered literal text, which is copied unchanged to the output. If you need to include a brace character in the literal text, it can be escaped by doubling: and .\n\nThe grammar for a replacement field is as follows:\n\nIn less formal terms, the replacement field can start with a field_name that specifies the object whose value is to be formatted and inserted into the output instead of the replacement field. The field_name is optionally followed by a conversion field, which is preceded by an exclamation point , and a format_spec, which is preceded by a colon . These specify a non-default format for the replacement value.\n\nSee also the Format Specification Mini-Language section.\n\nThe field_name itself begins with an arg_name that is either a number or a keyword. If it’s a number, it refers to a positional argument, and if it’s a keyword, it refers to a named keyword argument. An arg_name is treated as a number if a call to on the string would return true. If the numerical arg_names in a format string are 0, 1, 2, … in sequence, they can all be omitted (not just some) and the numbers 0, 1, 2, … will be automatically inserted in that order. Because arg_name is not quote-delimited, it is not possible to specify arbitrary dictionary keys (e.g., the strings or ) within a format string. The arg_name can be followed by any number of index or attribute expressions. An expression of the form selects the named attribute using , while an expression of the form does an index lookup using .\n\nThe conversion field causes a type coercion before formatting. Normally, the job of formatting a value is done by the method of the value itself. However, in some cases it is desirable to force a type to be formatted as a string, overriding its own definition of formatting. By converting the value to a string before calling , the normal formatting logic is bypassed.\n\nThree conversion flags are currently supported: which calls on the value, which calls and which calls .\n\nThe format_spec field contains a specification of how the value should be presented, including such details as field width, alignment, padding, decimal precision and so on. Each value type can define its own “formatting mini-language” or interpretation of the format_spec.\n\nMost built-in types support a common formatting mini-language, which is described in the next section.\n\nA format_spec field can also include nested replacement fields within it. These nested replacement fields may contain a field name, conversion flag and format specification, but deeper nesting is not allowed. The replacement fields within the format_spec are substituted before the format_spec string is interpreted. This allows the formatting of a value to be dynamically specified.\n\nSee the Format examples section for some examples.\n\n“Format specifications” are used within replacement fields contained within a format string to define how individual values are presented (see Format String Syntax and f-strings). They can also be passed directly to the built-in function. Each formattable type may define how the format specification is to be interpreted. Most built-in types implement the following options for format specifications, although some of the formatting options are only supported by the numeric types. A general convention is that an empty format specification produces the same result as if you had called on the value. A non-empty format specification typically modifies the result. The general form of a standard format specifier is: If a valid align value is specified, it can be preceded by a fill character that can be any character and defaults to a space if omitted. It is not possible to use a literal curly brace (” ” or “ ”) as the fill character in a formatted string literal or when using the method. However, it is possible to insert a curly brace with a nested replacement field. This limitation doesn’t affect the function. The meaning of the various alignment options is as follows: Forces the field to be left-aligned within the available space (this is the default for most objects). Forces the field to be right-aligned within the available space (this is the default for numbers). Forces the padding to be placed after the sign (if any) but before the digits. This is used for printing fields in the form ‘+000000120’. This alignment option is only valid for numeric types, excluding . It becomes the default for numbers when ‘0’ immediately precedes the field width. Forces the field to be centered within the available space. Note that unless a minimum field width is defined, the field width will always be the same size as the data to fill it, so that the alignment option has no meaning in this case. The sign option is only valid for number types, and can be one of the following: indicates that a sign should be used for both positive as well as negative numbers. indicates that a sign should be used only for negative numbers (this is the default behavior). indicates that a leading space should be used on positive numbers, and a minus sign on negative numbers. The option coerces negative zero floating-point values to positive zero after rounding to the format precision. This option is only valid for floating-point presentation types. Changed in version 3.11: Added the option (see also PEP 682). The option causes the “alternate form” to be used for the conversion. The alternate form is defined differently for different types. This option is only valid for integer, float and complex types. For integers, when binary, octal, or hexadecimal output is used, this option adds the respective prefix , , , or to the output value. For float and complex the alternate form causes the result of the conversion to always contain a decimal-point character, even if no digits follow it. Normally, a decimal-point character appears in the result of these conversions only if a digit follows it. In addition, for and conversions, trailing zeros are not removed from the result. The option signals the use of a comma for a thousands separator for floating-point presentation types and for integer presentation type . For other presentation types, this option is an error. For a locale aware separator, use the integer presentation type instead. Changed in version 3.1: Added the option (see also PEP 378). The option signals the use of an underscore for a thousands separator for floating-point presentation types and for integer presentation type . For integer presentation types , , , and , underscores will be inserted every 4 digits. For other presentation types, specifying this option is an error. Changed in version 3.6: Added the option (see also PEP 515). width is a decimal integer defining the minimum total field width, including any prefixes, separators, and other formatting characters. If not specified, then the field width will be determined by the content. When no explicit alignment is given, preceding the width field by a zero ( ) character enables sign-aware zero-padding for numeric types, excluding . This is equivalent to a fill character of with an alignment type of . Changed in version 3.10: Preceding the width field by no longer affects the default alignment for strings. The precision is a decimal integer indicating how many digits should be displayed after the decimal point for presentation types and , or before and after the decimal point for presentation types or . For string presentation types the field indicates the maximum field size - in other words, how many characters will be used from the field content. The precision is not allowed for integer presentation types. Finally, the type determines how the data should be presented. The available string presentation types are: String format. This is the default type for strings and may be omitted. The available integer presentation types are: Character. Converts the integer to the corresponding unicode character before printing. Hex format. Outputs the number in base 16, using lower-case letters for the digits above 9. Hex format. Outputs the number in base 16, using upper-case letters for the digits above 9. In case is specified, the prefix will be upper-cased to as well. Number. This is the same as , except that it uses the current locale setting to insert the appropriate number separator characters. In addition to the above presentation types, integers can be formatted with the floating-point presentation types listed below (except and ). When doing so, is used to convert the integer to a floating-point number before formatting. The available presentation types for and values are: Scientific notation. For a given precision , formats the number in scientific notation with the letter ‘e’ separating the coefficient from the exponent. The coefficient has one digit before and digits after the decimal point, for a total of significant digits. With no precision given, uses a precision of digits after the decimal point for , and shows all coefficient digits for . If , the decimal point is omitted unless the option is used. Scientific notation. Same as except it uses an upper case ‘E’ as the separator character. Fixed-point notation. For a given precision , formats the number as a decimal number with exactly digits following the decimal point. With no precision given, uses a precision of digits after the decimal point for , and uses a precision large enough to show all coefficient digits for . If , the decimal point is omitted unless the option is used. Fixed-point notation. Same as , but converts to and to . General format. For a given precision , this rounds the number to significant digits and then formats the result in either fixed-point format or in scientific notation, depending on its magnitude. A precision of is treated as equivalent to a precision of . The precise rules are as follows: suppose that the result formatted with presentation type and precision would have exponent . Then, if , where is -4 for floats and -6 for , the number is formatted with presentation type and precision . Otherwise, the number is formatted with presentation type and precision . In both cases insignificant trailing zeros are removed from the significand, and the decimal point is also removed if there are no remaining digits following it, unless the option is used. With no precision given, uses a precision of significant digits for . For , the coefficient of the result is formed from the coefficient digits of the value; scientific notation is used for values smaller than in absolute value and values where the place value of the least significant digit is larger than 1, and fixed-point notation is used otherwise. Positive and negative infinity, positive and negative zero, and nans, are formatted as , , , and respectively, regardless of the precision. General format. Same as except switches to if the number gets too large. The representations of infinity and NaN are uppercased, too. Number. This is the same as , except that it uses the current locale setting to insert the appropriate number separator characters. Percentage. Multiplies the number by 100 and displays in fixed ( ) format, followed by a percent sign. For this is like the type, except that when fixed-point notation is used to format the result, it always includes at least one digit past the decimal point, and switches to the scientific notation when . When the precision is not specified, the latter will be as large as needed to represent the given value faithfully. For , this is the same as either or depending on the value of for the current decimal context. The overall effect is to match the output of as altered by the other format modifiers. The result should be correctly rounded to a given precision of digits after the decimal point. The rounding mode for matches that of the builtin. For , the rounding mode of the current context will be used. The available presentation types for are the same as those for ( is not allowed). Both the real and imaginary components of a complex number are formatted as floating-point numbers, according to the specified presentation type. They are separated by the mandatory sign of the imaginary part, the latter being terminated by a suffix. If the presentation type is missing, the result will match the output of (complex numbers with a non-zero real part are also surrounded by parentheses), possibly altered by other format modifiers.\n\nThis section contains examples of the syntax and comparison with the old -formatting. In most of the cases the syntax is similar to the old -formatting, with the addition of the and with used instead of . For example, can be translated to . The new format syntax also supports new and different options, shown in the following examples. is formed from the real part 'The complex number (3-5j) is formed from the real part 3.0 and the imaginary part -5.0.'

        "document": "The following sections describe the standard types that are built into the interpreter.\n\nThe principal built-in types are numerics, sequences, mappings, classes, instances and exceptions.\n\nSome collection classes are mutable. The methods that add, subtract, or rearrange their members in place, and don’t return a specific item, never return the collection instance itself but .\n\nSome operations are supported by several object types; in particular, practically all objects can be compared for equality, tested for truth value, and converted to a string (with the function or the slightly different function). The latter function is implicitly used when an object is written by the function.\n\nThere are three distinct numeric types: integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers. In addition, Booleans are a subtype of integers. Integers have unlimited precision. Floating-point numbers are usually implemented using double in C; information about the precision and internal representation of floating-point numbers for the machine on which your program is running is available in . Complex numbers have a real and imaginary part, which are each a floating-point number. To extract these parts from a complex number z, use and . (The standard library includes the additional numeric types , for rationals, and , for floating-point numbers with user-definable precision.) Numbers are created by numeric literals or as the result of built-in functions and operators. Unadorned integer literals (including hex, octal and binary numbers) yield integers. Numeric literals containing a decimal point or an exponent sign yield floating-point numbers. Appending or to a numeric literal yields an imaginary number (a complex number with a zero real part) which you can add to an integer or float to get a complex number with real and imaginary parts. Python fully supports mixed arithmetic: when a binary arithmetic operator has operands of different numeric types, the operand with the “narrower” type is widened to that of the other, where integer is narrower than floating point, which is narrower than complex. A comparison between numbers of different types behaves as though the exact values of those numbers were being compared. The constructors , , and can be used to produce numbers of a specific type. All numeric types (except complex) support the following operations (for priorities of the operations, see Operator precedence): absolute value or magnitude of x a complex number with real part re, imaginary part im. im defaults to zero. conjugate of the complex number c\n• None Also referred to as integer division. For operands of type , the result has type . For operands of type , the result has type . In general, the result is a whole integer, though the result’s type is not necessarily . The result is always rounded towards minus infinity: is , is , is , and is .\n• None Not for complex numbers. Instead convert to floats using if appropriate.\n• None Conversion from to truncates, discarding the fractional part. See functions and for alternative conversions.\n• None float also accepts the strings “nan” and “inf” with an optional prefix “+” or “-” for Not a Number (NaN) and positive or negative infinity.\n• None Python defines and to be , as is common for programming languages.\n• None The numeric literals accepted include the digits to or any Unicode equivalent (code points with the property). See the Unicode Standard for a complete list of code points with the property. All types ( and ) also include the following operations: x rounded to n digits, rounding half to even. If n is omitted, it defaults to 0. For additional numeric operations see the and modules. Bitwise operations only make sense for integers. The result of bitwise operations is calculated as though carried out in two’s complement with an infinite number of sign bits. The priorities of the binary bitwise operations are all lower than the numeric operations and higher than the comparisons; the unary operation has the same priority as the other unary numeric operations ( and ). This table lists the bitwise operations sorted in ascending priority: bitwise exclusive or of x and y\n• None Negative shift counts are illegal and cause a to be raised.\n• None A left shift by n bits is equivalent to multiplication by .\n• None A right shift by n bits is equivalent to floor division by .\n• None Performing these calculations with at least one extra sign extension bit in a finite two’s complement representation (a working bit-width of or more) is sufficient to get the same result as if there were an infinite number of sign bits. The int type implements the abstract base class. In addition, it provides a few more methods: Return the number of bits necessary to represent an integer in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros: More precisely, if is nonzero, then is the unique positive integer such that . Equivalently, when is small enough to have a correctly rounded logarithm, then . If is zero, then returns . Return the number of ones in the binary representation of the absolute value of the integer. This is also known as the population count. Example: Return an array of bytes representing an integer. The integer is represented using length bytes, and defaults to 1. An is raised if the integer is not representable with the given number of bytes. The byteorder argument determines the byte order used to represent the integer, and defaults to . If byteorder is , the most significant byte is at the beginning of the byte array. If byteorder is , the most significant byte is at the end of the byte array. The signed argument determines whether two’s complement is used to represent the integer. If signed is and a negative integer is given, an is raised. The default value for signed is . The default values can be used to conveniently turn an integer into a single byte object: However, when using the default arguments, don’t try to convert a value greater than 255 or you’ll get an . \"byteorder must be either 'little' or 'big'\" Changed in version 3.11: Added default argument values for and . Return the integer represented by the given array of bytes. The argument bytes must either be a bytes-like object or an iterable producing bytes. The byteorder argument determines the byte order used to represent the integer, and defaults to . If byteorder is , the most significant byte is at the beginning of the byte array. If byteorder is , the most significant byte is at the end of the byte array. To request the native byte order of the host system, use as the byte order value. The signed argument indicates whether two’s complement is used to represent the integer. \"byteorder must be either 'little' or 'big'\" Changed in version 3.11: Added default argument value for . Return a pair of integers whose ratio is equal to the original integer and has a positive denominator. The integer ratio of integers (whole numbers) is always the integer as the numerator and as the denominator. The float type implements the abstract base class. float also has the following additional methods. Return a pair of integers whose ratio is exactly equal to the original float. The ratio is in lowest terms and has a positive denominator. Raises on infinities and a on NaNs. Return if the float instance is finite with integral value, and otherwise: Two methods support conversion to and from hexadecimal strings. Since Python’s floats are stored internally as binary numbers, converting a float to or from a decimal string usually involves a small rounding error. In contrast, hexadecimal strings allow exact representation and specification of floating-point numbers. This can be useful when debugging, and in numerical work. Return a representation of a floating-point number as a hexadecimal string. For finite floating-point numbers, this representation will always include a leading and a trailing and exponent. Class method to return the float represented by a hexadecimal string s. The string s may have leading and trailing whitespace. Note that is an instance method, while is a class method. where the optional may by either or , and are strings of hexadecimal digits, and is a decimal integer with an optional leading sign. Case is not significant, and there must be at least one hexadecimal digit in either the integer or the fraction. This syntax is similar to the syntax specified in section 6.4.4.2 of the C99 standard, and also to the syntax used in Java 1.5 onwards. In particular, the output of is usable as a hexadecimal floating-point literal in C or Java code, and hexadecimal strings produced by C’s format character or Java’s are accepted by . Note that the exponent is written in decimal rather than hexadecimal, and that it gives the power of 2 by which to multiply the coefficient. For example, the hexadecimal string represents the floating-point number , or : Applying the reverse conversion to gives a different hexadecimal string representing the same number: For numbers and , possibly of different types, it’s a requirement that whenever (see the method documentation for more details). For ease of implementation and efficiency across a variety of numeric types (including , , and ) Python’s hash for numeric types is based on a single mathematical function that’s defined for any rational number, and hence applies to all instances of and , and all finite instances of and . Essentially, this function is given by reduction modulo for a fixed prime . The value of is made available to Python as the attribute of . CPython implementation detail: Currently, the prime used is on machines with 32-bit C longs and on machines with 64-bit C longs. Here are the rules in detail:\n• None If is a nonnegative rational number and is not divisible by , define as , where gives the inverse of modulo .\n• None If is a nonnegative rational number and is divisible by (but is not) then has no inverse modulo and the rule above doesn’t apply; in this case define to be the constant value .\n• None If is a negative rational number define as . If the resulting hash is , replace it with .\n• None The particular values and are used as hash values for positive infinity or negative infinity (respectively).\n• None For a number , the hash values of the real and imaginary parts are combined by computing , reduced modulo so that it lies in . Again, if the result is , it’s replaced with . To clarify the above rules, here’s some example Python code, equivalent to the built-in hash, for computing the hash of a rational number, , or : Assumes m and n are integers, with n positive. # Remove common factors of P. (Unnecessary if m and n already coprime.) # Fermat's Little Theorem: pow(n, P-1, P) is 1, so # pow(n, P-2, P) gives the inverse of n modulo P.\n\nThere are three basic sequence types: lists, tuples, and range objects. Additional sequence types tailored for processing of binary data and text strings are described in dedicated sections. The operations in the following table are supported by most sequence types, both mutable and immutable. The ABC is provided to make it easier to correctly implement these operations on custom sequence types. This table lists the sequence operations sorted in ascending priority. In the table, s and t are sequences of the same type, n, i, j and k are integers and x is an arbitrary object that meets any type and value restrictions imposed by s. The and operations have the same priorities as the comparison operations. The (concatenation) and (repetition) operations have the same priority as the corresponding numeric operations. if an item of s is equal to x, else if an item of s is equal to x, else the concatenation of s and t equivalent to adding s to itself n times slice of s from i to j with step k index of the first occurrence of x in s (at or after index i and before index j) total number of occurrences of x in s Sequences of the same type also support comparisons. In particular, tuples and lists are compared lexicographically by comparing corresponding elements. This means that to compare equal, every element must compare equal and the two sequences must be of the same type and have the same length. (For full details see Comparisons in the language reference.) Forward and reversed iterators over mutable sequences access values using an index. That index will continue to march forward (or backward) even if the underlying sequence is mutated. The iterator terminates only when an or a is encountered (or when the index drops below zero).\n• None While the and operations are used only for simple containment testing in the general case, some specialised sequences (such as , and ) also use them for subsequence testing:\n• None Values of n less than are treated as (which yields an empty sequence of the same type as s). Note that items in the sequence s are not copied; they are referenced multiple times. This often haunts new Python programmers; consider: What has happened is that is a one-element list containing an empty list, so all three elements of are references to this single empty list. Modifying any of the elements of modifies this single list. You can create a list of different lists this way: Further explanation is available in the FAQ entry How do I create a multidimensional list?.\n• None If i or j is negative, the index is relative to the end of sequence s: or is substituted. But note that is still .\n• None The slice of s from i to j is defined as the sequence of items with index k such that . If i or j is greater than , use . If i is omitted or , use . If j is omitted or , use . If i is greater than or equal to j, the slice is empty.\n• None The slice of s from i to j with step k is defined as the sequence of items with index such that . In other words, the indices are , , , and so on, stopping when j is reached (but never including j). When k is positive, i and j are reduced to if they are greater. When k is negative, i and j are reduced to if they are greater. If i or j are omitted or , they become “end” values (which end depends on the sign of k). Note, k cannot be zero. If k is , it is treated like .\n• None Concatenating immutable sequences always results in a new object. This means that building up a sequence by repeated concatenation will have a quadratic runtime cost in the total sequence length. To get a linear runtime cost, you must switch to one of the alternatives below:\n• None if concatenating objects, you can build a list and use at the end or else write to an instance and retrieve its value when complete\n• None if concatenating objects, you can similarly use or , or you can do in-place concatenation with a object. objects are mutable and have an efficient overallocation mechanism\n• None for other types, investigate the relevant class documentation\n• None Some sequence types (such as ) only support item sequences that follow specific patterns, and hence don’t support sequence concatenation or repetition.\n• None raises when x is not found in s. Not all implementations support passing the additional arguments i and j. These arguments allow efficient searching of subsections of the sequence. Passing the extra arguments is roughly equivalent to using , only without copying any data and with the returned index being relative to the start of the sequence rather than the start of the slice. The only operation that immutable sequence types generally implement that is not also implemented by mutable sequence types is support for the built-in. This support allows immutable sequences, such as instances, to be used as keys and stored in and instances. Attempting to hash an immutable sequence that contains unhashable values will result in . The operations in the following table are defined on mutable sequence types. The ABC is provided to make it easier to correctly implement these operations on custom sequence types. In the table s is an instance of a mutable sequence type, t is any iterable object and x is an arbitrary object that meets any type and value restrictions imposed by s (for example, only accepts integers that meet the value restriction ). item i of s is replaced by x slice of s from i to j is replaced by the contents of the iterable t the elements of are replaced by those of t removes the elements of from the list appends x to the end of the sequence (same as ) removes all items from s (same as ) creates a shallow copy of s (same as ) extends s with the contents of t (for the most part the same as ) inserts x into s at the index given by i (same as ) retrieves the item at i and also removes it from s removes the first item from s where is equal to x reverses the items of s in place\n• None If k is not equal to , t must have the same length as the slice it is replacing.\n• None The optional argument i defaults to , so that by default the last item is removed and returned.\n• None raises when x is not found in s.\n• None The method modifies the sequence in place for economy of space when reversing a large sequence. To remind users that it operates by side effect, it does not return the reversed sequence.\n• None and are included for consistency with the interfaces of mutable containers that don’t support slicing operations (such as and ). is not part of the ABC, but most concrete mutable sequence classes provide it.\n• None The value n is an integer, or an object implementing . Zero and negative values of n clear the sequence. Items in the sequence are not copied; they are referenced multiple times, as explained for under Common Sequence Operations. Lists are mutable sequences, typically used to store collections of homogeneous items (where the precise degree of similarity will vary by application). Lists may be constructed in several ways:\n• None Using a pair of square brackets to denote the empty list:\n• None Using the type constructor: or The constructor builds a list whose items are the same and in the same order as iterable’s items. iterable may be either a sequence, a container that supports iteration, or an iterator object. If iterable is already a list, a copy is made and returned, similar to . For example, returns and returns . If no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty list, . Many other operations also produce lists, including the built-in. Lists implement all of the common and mutable sequence operations. Lists also provide the following additional method: This method sorts the list in place, using only comparisons between items. Exceptions are not suppressed - if any comparison operations fail, the entire sort operation will fail (and the list will likely be left in a partially modified state). accepts two arguments that can only be passed by keyword (keyword-only arguments): key specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each list element (for example, ). The key corresponding to each item in the list is calculated once and then used for the entire sorting process. The default value of means that list items are sorted directly without calculating a separate key value. The utility is available to convert a 2.x style cmp function to a key function. reverse is a boolean value. If set to , then the list elements are sorted as if each comparison were reversed. This method modifies the sequence in place for economy of space when sorting a large sequence. To remind users that it operates by side effect, it does not return the sorted sequence (use to explicitly request a new sorted list instance). The method is guaranteed to be stable. A sort is stable if it guarantees not to change the relative order of elements that compare equal — this is helpful for sorting in multiple passes (for example, sort by department, then by salary grade). For sorting examples and a brief sorting tutorial, see Sorting Techniques. CPython implementation detail: While a list is being sorted, the effect of attempting to mutate, or even inspect, the list is undefined. The C implementation of Python makes the list appear empty for the duration, and raises if it can detect that the list has been mutated during a sort. Tuples are immutable sequences, typically used to store collections of heterogeneous data (such as the 2-tuples produced by the built-in). Tuples are also used for cases where an immutable sequence of homogeneous data is needed (such as allowing storage in a or instance). Tuples may be constructed in a number of ways:\n• None Using a pair of parentheses to denote the empty tuple:\n• None Using a trailing comma for a singleton tuple: or\n• None Using the built-in: or The constructor builds a tuple whose items are the same and in the same order as iterable’s items. iterable may be either a sequence, a container that supports iteration, or an iterator object. If iterable is already a tuple, it is returned unchanged. For example, returns and returns . If no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty tuple, . Note that it is actually the comma which makes a tuple, not the parentheses. The parentheses are optional, except in the empty tuple case, or when they are needed to avoid syntactic ambiguity. For example, is a function call with three arguments, while is a function call with a 3-tuple as the sole argument. Tuples implement all of the common sequence operations. For heterogeneous collections of data where access by name is clearer than access by index, may be a more appropriate choice than a simple tuple object. The type represents an immutable sequence of numbers and is commonly used for looping a specific number of times in loops. The arguments to the range constructor must be integers (either built-in or any object that implements the special method). If the step argument is omitted, it defaults to . If the start argument is omitted, it defaults to . If step is zero, is raised. For a positive step, the contents of a range are determined by the formula where and . For a negative step, the contents of the range are still determined by the formula , but the constraints are and . A range object will be empty if does not meet the value constraint. Ranges do support negative indices, but these are interpreted as indexing from the end of the sequence determined by the positive indices. Ranges containing absolute values larger than are permitted but some features (such as ) may raise . Ranges implement all of the common sequence operations except concatenation and repetition (due to the fact that range objects can only represent sequences that follow a strict pattern and repetition and concatenation will usually violate that pattern). The value of the start parameter (or if the parameter was not supplied) The value of the stop parameter The value of the step parameter (or if the parameter was not supplied) The advantage of the type over a regular or is that a object will always take the same (small) amount of memory, no matter the size of the range it represents (as it only stores the , and values, calculating individual items and subranges as needed). Range objects implement the ABC, and provide features such as containment tests, element index lookup, slicing and support for negative indices (see Sequence Types — list, tuple, range): Testing range objects for equality with and compares them as sequences. That is, two range objects are considered equal if they represent the same sequence of values. (Note that two range objects that compare equal might have different , and attributes, for example or .) Changed in version 3.2: Implement the Sequence ABC. Support slicing and negative indices. Test objects for membership in constant time instead of iterating through all items. Changed in version 3.3: Define ‘==’ and ‘!=’ to compare range objects based on the sequence of values they define (instead of comparing based on object identity).\n• None The linspace recipe shows how to implement a lazy version of range suitable for floating-point applications."

        "document": "There are several ways to present the output of a program; data can be printed in a human-readable form, or written to a file for future use. This chapter will discuss some of the possibilities.\n\nSo far we’ve encountered two ways of writing values: expression statements and the function. (A third way is using the method of file objects; the standard output file can be referenced as . See the Library Reference for more information on this.) Often you’ll want more control over the formatting of your output than simply printing space-separated values. There are several ways to format output.\n• None To use formatted string literals, begin a string with or before the opening quotation mark or triple quotation mark. Inside this string, you can write a Python expression between and characters that can refer to variables or literal values.\n• None The method of strings requires more manual effort. You’ll still use and to mark where a variable will be substituted and can provide detailed formatting directives, but you’ll also need to provide the information to be formatted. In the following code block there are two examples of how to format variables: Notice how the are padded with spaces and a negative sign only for negative numbers. The example also prints multiplied by 100, with 2 decimal places and followed by a percent sign (see Format Specification Mini-Language for details).\n• None Finally, you can do all the string handling yourself by using string slicing and concatenation operations to create any layout you can imagine. The string type has some methods that perform useful operations for padding strings to a given column width. When you don’t need fancy output but just want a quick display of some variables for debugging purposes, you can convert any value to a string with the or functions. The function is meant to return representations of values which are fairly human-readable, while is meant to generate representations which can be read by the interpreter (or will force a if there is no equivalent syntax). For objects which don’t have a particular representation for human consumption, will return the same value as . Many values, such as numbers or structures like lists and dictionaries, have the same representation using either function. Strings, in particular, have two distinct representations. The value of x is 32.5, and y is 40000... # The repr() of a string adds string quotes and backslashes: # The argument to repr() may be any Python object: The module contains a class that offers yet another way to substitute values into strings, using placeholders like and replacing them with values from a dictionary, but offers much less control of the formatting. Formatted string literals (also called f-strings for short) let you include the value of Python expressions inside a string by prefixing the string with or and writing expressions as . An optional format specifier can follow the expression. This allows greater control over how the value is formatted. The following example rounds pi to three places after the decimal: 'The value of pi is approximately The value of pi is approximately 3.142. Passing an integer after the will cause that field to be a minimum number of characters wide. This is useful for making columns line up. Other modifiers can be used to convert the value before it is formatted. applies , applies , and applies : 'My hovercraft is full of My hovercraft is full of eels. 'My hovercraft is full of My hovercraft is full of 'eels'. The specifier can be used to expand an expression to the text of the expression, an equal sign, then the representation of the evaluated expression: See self-documenting expressions for more information on the specifier. For a reference on these format specifications, see the reference guide for the Format Specification Mini-Language. Basic usage of the method looks like this: We are the knights who say \"Ni!\" The brackets and characters within them (called format fields) are replaced with the objects passed into the method. A number in the brackets can be used to refer to the position of the object passed into the method. If keyword arguments are used in the method, their values are referred to by using the name of the argument. Positional and keyword arguments can be arbitrarily combined: The story of Bill, Manfred, and Georg. If you have a really long format string that you don’t want to split up, it would be nice if you could reference the variables to be formatted by name instead of by position. This can be done by simply passing the dict and using square brackets to access the keys. This could also be done by passing the dictionary as keyword arguments with the notation. This is particularly useful in combination with the built-in function , which returns a dictionary containing all local variables: __name__: __main__; __doc__: None; __package__: None; __loader__: ... As an example, the following lines produce a tidily aligned set of columns giving integers and their squares and cubes: For a complete overview of string formatting with , see Format String Syntax. Here’s the same table of squares and cubes, formatted manually: # Note use of 'end' on previous line The method of string objects right-justifies a string in a field of a given width by padding it with spaces on the left. There are similar methods and . These methods do not write anything, they just return a new string. If the input string is too long, they don’t truncate it, but return it unchanged; this will mess up your column lay-out but that’s usually better than the alternative, which would be lying about a value. (If you really want truncation you can always add a slice operation, as in .) There is another method, , which pads a numeric string on the left with zeros. It understands about plus and minus signs: The % operator (modulo) can also be used for string formatting. Given (where format is a string), conversion specifications in format are replaced with zero or more elements of values. This operation is commonly known as string interpolation. For example: 'The value of pi is approximately The value of pi is approximately 3.142. More information can be found in the printf-style String Formatting section.\n\nreturns a file object, and is most commonly used with two positional arguments and one keyword argument: The first argument is a string containing the filename. The second argument is another string containing a few characters describing the way in which the file will be used. mode can be when the file will only be read, for only writing (an existing file with the same name will be erased), and opens the file for appending; any data written to the file is automatically added to the end. opens the file for both reading and writing. The mode argument is optional; will be assumed if it’s omitted. Normally, files are opened in text mode, that means, you read and write strings from and to the file, which are encoded in a specific encoding. If encoding is not specified, the default is platform dependent (see ). Because UTF-8 is the modern de-facto standard, is recommended unless you know that you need to use a different encoding. Appending a to the mode opens the file in binary mode. Binary mode data is read and written as objects. You can not specify encoding when opening file in binary mode. In text mode, the default when reading is to convert platform-specific line endings ( on Unix, on Windows) to just . When writing in text mode, the default is to convert occurrences of back to platform-specific line endings. This behind-the-scenes modification to file data is fine for text files, but will corrupt binary data like that in or files. Be very careful to use binary mode when reading and writing such files. It is good practice to use the keyword when dealing with file objects. The advantage is that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised at some point. Using is also much shorter than writing equivalent - blocks: # We can check that the file has been automatically closed. If you’re not using the keyword, then you should call to close the file and immediately free up any system resources used by it. Calling without using the keyword or calling might result in the arguments of not being completely written to the disk, even if the program exits successfully. After a file object is closed, either by a statement or by calling , attempts to use the file object will automatically fail. The rest of the examples in this section will assume that a file object called has already been created. To read a file’s contents, call , which reads some quantity of data and returns it as a string (in text mode) or bytes object (in binary mode). size is an optional numeric argument. When size is omitted or negative, the entire contents of the file will be read and returned; it’s your problem if the file is twice as large as your machine’s memory. Otherwise, at most size characters (in text mode) or size bytes (in binary mode) are read and returned. If the end of the file has been reached, will return an empty string ( ). 'This is the entire file.\n\n' reads a single line from the file; a newline character ( ) is left at the end of the string, and is only omitted on the last line of the file if the file doesn’t end in a newline. This makes the return value unambiguous; if returns an empty string, the end of the file has been reached, while a blank line is represented by , a string containing only a single newline. 'This is the first line of the file.\n\n' 'Second line of the file\n\n' For reading lines from a file, you can loop over the file object. This is memory efficient, fast, and leads to simple code: This is the first line of the file. If you want to read all the lines of a file in a list you can also use or . writes the contents of string to the file, returning the number of characters written. Other types of objects need to be converted – either to a string (in text mode) or a bytes object (in binary mode) – before writing them: returns an integer giving the file object’s current position in the file represented as number of bytes from the beginning of the file when in binary mode and an opaque number when in text mode. To change the file object’s position, use . The position is computed from adding offset to a reference point; the reference point is selected by the whence argument. A whence value of 0 measures from the beginning of the file, 1 uses the current file position, and 2 uses the end of the file as the reference point. whence can be omitted and defaults to 0, using the beginning of the file as the reference point. # Go to the 6th byte in the file # Go to the 3rd byte before the end In text files (those opened without a in the mode string), only seeks relative to the beginning of the file are allowed (the exception being seeking to the very file end with ) and the only valid offset values are those returned from the , or zero. Any other offset value produces undefined behaviour. File objects have some additional methods, such as and which are less frequently used; consult the Library Reference for a complete guide to file objects. Strings can easily be written to and read from a file. Numbers take a bit more effort, since the method only returns strings, which will have to be passed to a function like , which takes a string like and returns its numeric value 123. When you want to save more complex data types like nested lists and dictionaries, parsing and serializing by hand becomes complicated. Rather than having users constantly writing and debugging code to save complicated data types to files, Python allows you to use the popular data interchange format called JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). The standard module called can take Python data hierarchies, and convert them to string representations; this process is called serializing. Reconstructing the data from the string representation is called deserializing. Between serializing and deserializing, the string representing the object may have been stored in a file or data, or sent over a network connection to some distant machine. The JSON format is commonly used by modern applications to allow for data exchange. Many programmers are already familiar with it, which makes it a good choice for interoperability. If you have an object , you can view its JSON string representation with a simple line of code: Another variant of the function, called , simply serializes the object to a text file. So if is a text file object opened for writing, we can do this: To decode the object again, if is a binary file or text file object which has been opened for reading: JSON files must be encoded in UTF-8. Use when opening JSON file as a text file for both of reading and writing. This simple serialization technique can handle lists and dictionaries, but serializing arbitrary class instances in JSON requires a bit of extra effort. The reference for the module contains an explanation of this. Contrary to JSON, pickle is a protocol which allows the serialization of arbitrarily complex Python objects. As such, it is specific to Python and cannot be used to communicate with applications written in other languages. It is also insecure by default: deserializing pickle data coming from an untrusted source can execute arbitrary code, if the data was crafted by a skilled attacker."

In this tutorial we will cover Python string operations: concatenation, multiplication, indexing and slicing. If you’re just joining us, you might want to check out our previous tutorial introducing strings.\n\nThink of strings like beads on a necklace. In fact, let’s make a string necklace right now. First, we need an empty string. We create strings by wrapping quotation marks around a value. I’m calling my string and I’m declaring it with two quotation marks with nothing in-between.\n\nThe interpreter returns an empty string. Even though there is nothing to display, an empty string is still a string. See for yourself…\n\nAnd it still holds a place in memory (remember: your memory location will be different than mine):\n\nA blank space is considered a character so a single space is also a string. Try it:\n\nLet’s add our first bead. We do so using the + operator and any character so long as it is wrapped in quotation marks…\n\nGreat! Now we have one bead on our necklace, or, rather, character on our string.\n\nThe operation we performed there wasn’t addition, though. It’s what in computer programming is referred to as concatenation. Concatenation is the joining of two strings end-to-end.\n\nBut wait a minute! Why did I add to itself? Because strings are immutable, which means they can’t be changed. Unlike numerical values, a string can’t be changed after it is declared. In order to store the value of a string operation, we need to assign it to a new variable. In this case, I am assigning to the value currently stored in , ‘’, an empty string, plus the value ‘O’.\n\nTry adding another character without assigning our string value to a new variable.\n\nThat gave us the output we expected. But as you will see, it didn’t store that value. Call again:\n\nLet’s add another bead to our necklace with an assignment statement:\n\nThat’s more like it. But at this rate it’s going to take forever to make a nice, long string of characters. Let’s speed up the process with the * operator.\n\nBecause a string is a sequence, we can access a single character or slices of it with the index operator, [ ]. I like to think of the index operator like the claw crane game you find in an arcade. Let’s create a new string, ‘sock monkey’, assigned to the variable , for string.\n\nI drop my index claw into my variable, like so:\n\nAnd I pull out the zeroth element, ‘s’.\n\nWhat happens if I grab the 4th element?\n\nMy index claw grabs the blank, which, though it doesn’t look like much, is still a valid and very important character.\n\nGrabbing individual letters from a string is fun… the first few times. So let’s extract larger chunks. We can pass more than one value to the index operator, defining the range of the slice we want to extract. I want the monkey without the sock, so…\n\nThis is the same as:\n\nIf we want everything beyond our starting index, we don’t need to specify our end point.\n\nIt works in the other direction, too.\n\nDid you notice something odd there? We declared index 4, and though our interpreter returned four characters, it only returned those from the indices 0, 1, 2 & 3, not 4. This is how slicing works in Python. The operation returns everything up to the specified index.\n\nLet’s verify this by calling the indices individually:\n\nWe can also access indices backwards with negative integers:\n\nCool, right? It gets better. Next up? String methods!"

It’s especially useful for text manipulation and data parsing.\n\nLet’s take a quick example of string slicing:\n\nExplanation: In this example, we used the slice s[0:5] to obtain the substring “Hello” from the original string.\n• end (optional): Stopping index (exclusive). Defaults to the end of the string if omitted.\n• step (optional): Interval between indices. A positive value slices from left to right, while a negative value slices from right to left.

If indices exceed the string length, the slice returns only available characters without raising an error.\n\nExample: The slice s[3:15] starts at index 3 and attempts to reach index 15, but if string ends at index 8 then it will return only the available elements.\n\nNegative indexing is useful for accessing elements from the end of the String. The last element has an index of -1, the second last element -2, and so on.\n\nBelow example shows how to use negative numbers to access elements from the string starting from the end. Negative indexing makes it easy to get items without needing to know the exact length of the string.\n\nTo reverse a string, use a negative step value of -1, which moves from the end of the string to the beginning.\n\nExplanation: The slice s[::-1] starts from the end and steps backward through the string, which effectively reversing it.
