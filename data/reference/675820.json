        "document": "I am using Azure Analysis Service with Power BI and I am using a matrix visual where I have used 5 fields as ROWS, 1 field as COLUMN which will work as column name and finally 1 field which is used as VALUES. For 2 data entries, those 5 fields(ROWS) have exactly the same value therefore in Power BI it is coming as a single row and value is showing as \"First value\". When I used summarization at Azure Analysis Service and passed it to Power BI, those 2 entires are still coming as a single row but the values are now getting summed up/aggregated. Can anyone help me with this how I can avoid this aggregation in Power BI and get two separate entries of the row without getting their values getting summed up?\n\nNote: I am using Azure Analysis Service for all the calculations. In Azure Analysis Service, they are coming in 2 separate rows as 2 individual entries, but when it comes to power bi, VALUES are getting summed up.\n\nFirst image is with the value 32 which is the first value.\n\nTo solve this I did enable summarization in Azure Analysis Service and passed it to Power BI. Hence the second image is with the value 66 which is the summed up value (We have 2 entries with individual values as 32 and 34 but in Power BI it is coming as a single row with 32+34 = 66 as the aggregated value)"

Please refer screenshot below for the output i require.\n\nTo achieve my objective, I used the approach from following URL to create a static custom table - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52632713/custom-aggregate-column-in-power-bi-matrix. This same approach is suggested univerally on many platforms.\n\nThis approach works fine when there's one measure used in \"Value\" field of the Matrix. In my case, i have two measures to be used i.e. of Sales & % Profit. I can't have single measure because it'd lead to a mix up between Sales & % Profit values while drilling up/down on the Matrix.\n\nHaving these two measures in Value field of Matrix leads to the two red cells shown in my screenshot below to have the header names of Sales & % Profit itself, carried from Value field of Matrix. Instead, I want to use custom column names of Budget & Gross Profit.. This is where am stuck with. I am unable to find a way to change the red cells to my custom column header names."

        "document": "In this blog post, we’ll delve into the new layouts available for Matrix visual layouts in Power BI. We’ll explore different layouts, their purposes, and demonstrate how to create simple reports like cash flows or P&L reports using these new features. This update is part of Power BI’s May 2024 feature updates and aims to enhance the user experience, especially for those familiar with Excel pivot tables. Let’s get started!\n\nPower BI has introduced new layout options for Matrix visuals, mimicking the Excel pivot table experience. These layouts are designed to be more intuitive for users transitioning from Excel to Power BI. Let’s explore these options in detail.\n\nThe compact layout is the new default setting for Matrix visuals. It uses indentation to represent hierarchical data, similar to the stepped layout previously available. This layout is efficient in terms of space, allowing more data to be visible on the report page without scrolling.\n• None Navigate to the Format pane, select Layout, and choose Compact.\n\nThe outline layout removes the indentation and displays hierarchical data in separate columns. This layout is reminiscent of early Matrix visuals in Power BI, offering a clear and organized view of your data.\n• None Navigate to the Format pane, select Layout, and choose Outline.\n• None Adjust the row subtotals to appear at the top or bottom as needed.\n\nThe tabular layout is similar to the outline layout but eliminates the blank rows between categories, making the visual more compact. This layout is ideal for reports where space is a premium and a cleaner look is preferred.\n• None Navigate to the Format pane, select Layout, and choose Tabular.\n\nNow that we’ve covered the new layouts, let’s create a simple cash flow report using the Matrix visual.\n• Prepare Your Data : Ensure you have a dataset with revenue, expenses, and categories.\n• Create the Matrix Visual\n• None Add your data fields to the Matrix (e.g., Revenue, Expenses, Categories).\n• None Organize your fields in the Rows and Columns wells.\n• Format the Matrix Visual\n• None Enable row subtotals and position them at the bottom.\n• None Change the layout to Outline or Tabular for a cleaner look.\n• Customize Subtotals\n• None Rename row subtotals to more descriptive labels like “Subtotal” and “Net Profit”.\n\nThe new Matrix visual layouts in Power BI offer flexibility and familiarity for Excel users, making data presentation more intuitive and efficient. By using these new layouts, you can create detailed and organized reports like cash flows and P&L statements with ease."
