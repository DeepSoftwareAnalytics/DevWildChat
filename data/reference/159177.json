        "document": "The following sections describe the standard types that are built into the interpreter.\n\nThe principal built-in types are numerics, sequences, mappings, classes, instances and exceptions.\n\nSome collection classes are mutable. The methods that add, subtract, or rearrange their members in place, and don’t return a specific item, never return the collection instance itself but .\n\nSome operations are supported by several object types; in particular, practically all objects can be compared for equality, tested for truth value, and converted to a string (with the function or the slightly different function). The latter function is implicitly used when an object is written by the function.\n\nThere are three distinct numeric types: integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers. In addition, Booleans are a subtype of integers. Integers have unlimited precision. Floating-point numbers are usually implemented using double in C; information about the precision and internal representation of floating-point numbers for the machine on which your program is running is available in . Complex numbers have a real and imaginary part, which are each a floating-point number. To extract these parts from a complex number z, use and . (The standard library includes the additional numeric types , for rationals, and , for floating-point numbers with user-definable precision.) Numbers are created by numeric literals or as the result of built-in functions and operators. Unadorned integer literals (including hex, octal and binary numbers) yield integers. Numeric literals containing a decimal point or an exponent sign yield floating-point numbers. Appending or to a numeric literal yields an imaginary number (a complex number with a zero real part) which you can add to an integer or float to get a complex number with real and imaginary parts. Python fully supports mixed arithmetic: when a binary arithmetic operator has operands of different numeric types, the operand with the “narrower” type is widened to that of the other, where integer is narrower than floating point, which is narrower than complex. A comparison between numbers of different types behaves as though the exact values of those numbers were being compared. The constructors , , and can be used to produce numbers of a specific type. All numeric types (except complex) support the following operations (for priorities of the operations, see Operator precedence): absolute value or magnitude of x a complex number with real part re, imaginary part im. im defaults to zero. conjugate of the complex number c\n• None Also referred to as integer division. For operands of type , the result has type . For operands of type , the result has type . In general, the result is a whole integer, though the result’s type is not necessarily . The result is always rounded towards minus infinity: is , is , is , and is .\n• None Not for complex numbers. Instead convert to floats using if appropriate.\n• None Conversion from to truncates, discarding the fractional part. See functions and for alternative conversions.\n• None float also accepts the strings “nan” and “inf” with an optional prefix “+” or “-” for Not a Number (NaN) and positive or negative infinity.\n• None Python defines and to be , as is common for programming languages.\n• None The numeric literals accepted include the digits to or any Unicode equivalent (code points with the property). See the Unicode Standard for a complete list of code points with the property. All types ( and ) also include the following operations: x rounded to n digits, rounding half to even. If n is omitted, it defaults to 0. For additional numeric operations see the and modules. Bitwise operations only make sense for integers. The result of bitwise operations is calculated as though carried out in two’s complement with an infinite number of sign bits. The priorities of the binary bitwise operations are all lower than the numeric operations and higher than the comparisons; the unary operation has the same priority as the other unary numeric operations ( and ). This table lists the bitwise operations sorted in ascending priority: bitwise exclusive or of x and y\n• None Negative shift counts are illegal and cause a to be raised.\n• None A left shift by n bits is equivalent to multiplication by .\n• None A right shift by n bits is equivalent to floor division by .\n• None Performing these calculations with at least one extra sign extension bit in a finite two’s complement representation (a working bit-width of or more) is sufficient to get the same result as if there were an infinite number of sign bits. The int type implements the abstract base class. In addition, it provides a few more methods: Return the number of bits necessary to represent an integer in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros: More precisely, if is nonzero, then is the unique positive integer such that . Equivalently, when is small enough to have a correctly rounded logarithm, then . If is zero, then returns . Return the number of ones in the binary representation of the absolute value of the integer. This is also known as the population count. Example: Return an array of bytes representing an integer. The integer is represented using length bytes, and defaults to 1. An is raised if the integer is not representable with the given number of bytes. The byteorder argument determines the byte order used to represent the integer, and defaults to . If byteorder is , the most significant byte is at the beginning of the byte array. If byteorder is , the most significant byte is at the end of the byte array. The signed argument determines whether two’s complement is used to represent the integer. If signed is and a negative integer is given, an is raised. The default value for signed is . The default values can be used to conveniently turn an integer into a single byte object: However, when using the default arguments, don’t try to convert a value greater than 255 or you’ll get an . \"byteorder must be either 'little' or 'big'\" Changed in version 3.11: Added default argument values for and . Return the integer represented by the given array of bytes. The argument bytes must either be a bytes-like object or an iterable producing bytes. The byteorder argument determines the byte order used to represent the integer, and defaults to . If byteorder is , the most significant byte is at the beginning of the byte array. If byteorder is , the most significant byte is at the end of the byte array. To request the native byte order of the host system, use as the byte order value. The signed argument indicates whether two’s complement is used to represent the integer. \"byteorder must be either 'little' or 'big'\" Changed in version 3.11: Added default argument value for . Return a pair of integers whose ratio is equal to the original integer and has a positive denominator. The integer ratio of integers (whole numbers) is always the integer as the numerator and as the denominator. The float type implements the abstract base class. float also has the following additional methods. Return a pair of integers whose ratio is exactly equal to the original float. The ratio is in lowest terms and has a positive denominator. Raises on infinities and a on NaNs. Return if the float instance is finite with integral value, and otherwise: Two methods support conversion to and from hexadecimal strings. Since Python’s floats are stored internally as binary numbers, converting a float to or from a decimal string usually involves a small rounding error. In contrast, hexadecimal strings allow exact representation and specification of floating-point numbers. This can be useful when debugging, and in numerical work. Return a representation of a floating-point number as a hexadecimal string. For finite floating-point numbers, this representation will always include a leading and a trailing and exponent. Class method to return the float represented by a hexadecimal string s. The string s may have leading and trailing whitespace. Note that is an instance method, while is a class method. where the optional may by either or , and are strings of hexadecimal digits, and is a decimal integer with an optional leading sign. Case is not significant, and there must be at least one hexadecimal digit in either the integer or the fraction. This syntax is similar to the syntax specified in section 6.4.4.2 of the C99 standard, and also to the syntax used in Java 1.5 onwards. In particular, the output of is usable as a hexadecimal floating-point literal in C or Java code, and hexadecimal strings produced by C’s format character or Java’s are accepted by . Note that the exponent is written in decimal rather than hexadecimal, and that it gives the power of 2 by which to multiply the coefficient. For example, the hexadecimal string represents the floating-point number , or : Applying the reverse conversion to gives a different hexadecimal string representing the same number: For numbers and , possibly of different types, it’s a requirement that whenever (see the method documentation for more details). For ease of implementation and efficiency across a variety of numeric types (including , , and ) Python’s hash for numeric types is based on a single mathematical function that’s defined for any rational number, and hence applies to all instances of and , and all finite instances of and . Essentially, this function is given by reduction modulo for a fixed prime . The value of is made available to Python as the attribute of . CPython implementation detail: Currently, the prime used is on machines with 32-bit C longs and on machines with 64-bit C longs. Here are the rules in detail:\n• None If is a nonnegative rational number and is not divisible by , define as , where gives the inverse of modulo .\n• None If is a nonnegative rational number and is divisible by (but is not) then has no inverse modulo and the rule above doesn’t apply; in this case define to be the constant value .\n• None If is a negative rational number define as . If the resulting hash is , replace it with .\n• None The particular values and are used as hash values for positive infinity or negative infinity (respectively).\n• None For a number , the hash values of the real and imaginary parts are combined by computing , reduced modulo so that it lies in . Again, if the result is , it’s replaced with . To clarify the above rules, here’s some example Python code, equivalent to the built-in hash, for computing the hash of a rational number, , or : Assumes m and n are integers, with n positive. # Remove common factors of P. (Unnecessary if m and n already coprime.) # Fermat's Little Theorem: pow(n, P-1, P) is 1, so # pow(n, P-2, P) gives the inverse of n modulo P.\n\nThere are three basic sequence types: lists, tuples, and range objects. Additional sequence types tailored for processing of binary data and text strings are described in dedicated sections. The operations in the following table are supported by most sequence types, both mutable and immutable. The ABC is provided to make it easier to correctly implement these operations on custom sequence types. This table lists the sequence operations sorted in ascending priority. In the table, s and t are sequences of the same type, n, i, j and k are integers and x is an arbitrary object that meets any type and value restrictions imposed by s. The and operations have the same priorities as the comparison operations. The (concatenation) and (repetition) operations have the same priority as the corresponding numeric operations. if an item of s is equal to x, else if an item of s is equal to x, else the concatenation of s and t equivalent to adding s to itself n times slice of s from i to j with step k index of the first occurrence of x in s (at or after index i and before index j) total number of occurrences of x in s Sequences of the same type also support comparisons. In particular, tuples and lists are compared lexicographically by comparing corresponding elements. This means that to compare equal, every element must compare equal and the two sequences must be of the same type and have the same length. (For full details see Comparisons in the language reference.) Forward and reversed iterators over mutable sequences access values using an index. That index will continue to march forward (or backward) even if the underlying sequence is mutated. The iterator terminates only when an or a is encountered (or when the index drops below zero).\n• None While the and operations are used only for simple containment testing in the general case, some specialised sequences (such as , and ) also use them for subsequence testing:\n• None Values of n less than are treated as (which yields an empty sequence of the same type as s). Note that items in the sequence s are not copied; they are referenced multiple times. This often haunts new Python programmers; consider: What has happened is that is a one-element list containing an empty list, so all three elements of are references to this single empty list. Modifying any of the elements of modifies this single list. You can create a list of different lists this way: Further explanation is available in the FAQ entry How do I create a multidimensional list?.\n• None If i or j is negative, the index is relative to the end of sequence s: or is substituted. But note that is still .\n• None The slice of s from i to j is defined as the sequence of items with index k such that . If i or j is greater than , use . If i is omitted or , use . If j is omitted or , use . If i is greater than or equal to j, the slice is empty.\n• None The slice of s from i to j with step k is defined as the sequence of items with index such that . In other words, the indices are , , , and so on, stopping when j is reached (but never including j). When k is positive, i and j are reduced to if they are greater. When k is negative, i and j are reduced to if they are greater. If i or j are omitted or , they become “end” values (which end depends on the sign of k). Note, k cannot be zero. If k is , it is treated like .\n• None Concatenating immutable sequences always results in a new object. This means that building up a sequence by repeated concatenation will have a quadratic runtime cost in the total sequence length. To get a linear runtime cost, you must switch to one of the alternatives below:\n• None if concatenating objects, you can build a list and use at the end or else write to an instance and retrieve its value when complete\n• None if concatenating objects, you can similarly use or , or you can do in-place concatenation with a object. objects are mutable and have an efficient overallocation mechanism\n• None for other types, investigate the relevant class documentation\n• None Some sequence types (such as ) only support item sequences that follow specific patterns, and hence don’t support sequence concatenation or repetition.\n• None raises when x is not found in s. Not all implementations support passing the additional arguments i and j. These arguments allow efficient searching of subsections of the sequence. Passing the extra arguments is roughly equivalent to using , only without copying any data and with the returned index being relative to the start of the sequence rather than the start of the slice. The only operation that immutable sequence types generally implement that is not also implemented by mutable sequence types is support for the built-in. This support allows immutable sequences, such as instances, to be used as keys and stored in and instances. Attempting to hash an immutable sequence that contains unhashable values will result in . The operations in the following table are defined on mutable sequence types. The ABC is provided to make it easier to correctly implement these operations on custom sequence types. In the table s is an instance of a mutable sequence type, t is any iterable object and x is an arbitrary object that meets any type and value restrictions imposed by s (for example, only accepts integers that meet the value restriction ). item i of s is replaced by x slice of s from i to j is replaced by the contents of the iterable t the elements of are replaced by those of t removes the elements of from the list appends x to the end of the sequence (same as ) removes all items from s (same as ) creates a shallow copy of s (same as ) extends s with the contents of t (for the most part the same as ) inserts x into s at the index given by i (same as ) retrieves the item at i and also removes it from s removes the first item from s where is equal to x reverses the items of s in place\n• None If k is not equal to , t must have the same length as the slice it is replacing.\n• None The optional argument i defaults to , so that by default the last item is removed and returned.\n• None raises when x is not found in s.\n• None The method modifies the sequence in place for economy of space when reversing a large sequence. To remind users that it operates by side effect, it does not return the reversed sequence.\n• None and are included for consistency with the interfaces of mutable containers that don’t support slicing operations (such as and ). is not part of the ABC, but most concrete mutable sequence classes provide it.\n• None The value n is an integer, or an object implementing . Zero and negative values of n clear the sequence. Items in the sequence are not copied; they are referenced multiple times, as explained for under Common Sequence Operations. Lists are mutable sequences, typically used to store collections of homogeneous items (where the precise degree of similarity will vary by application). Lists may be constructed in several ways:\n• None Using a pair of square brackets to denote the empty list:\n• None Using the type constructor: or The constructor builds a list whose items are the same and in the same order as iterable’s items. iterable may be either a sequence, a container that supports iteration, or an iterator object. If iterable is already a list, a copy is made and returned, similar to . For example, returns and returns . If no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty list, . Many other operations also produce lists, including the built-in. Lists implement all of the common and mutable sequence operations. Lists also provide the following additional method: This method sorts the list in place, using only comparisons between items. Exceptions are not suppressed - if any comparison operations fail, the entire sort operation will fail (and the list will likely be left in a partially modified state). accepts two arguments that can only be passed by keyword (keyword-only arguments): key specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each list element (for example, ). The key corresponding to each item in the list is calculated once and then used for the entire sorting process. The default value of means that list items are sorted directly without calculating a separate key value. The utility is available to convert a 2.x style cmp function to a key function. reverse is a boolean value. If set to , then the list elements are sorted as if each comparison were reversed. This method modifies the sequence in place for economy of space when sorting a large sequence. To remind users that it operates by side effect, it does not return the sorted sequence (use to explicitly request a new sorted list instance). The method is guaranteed to be stable. A sort is stable if it guarantees not to change the relative order of elements that compare equal — this is helpful for sorting in multiple passes (for example, sort by department, then by salary grade). For sorting examples and a brief sorting tutorial, see Sorting Techniques. CPython implementation detail: While a list is being sorted, the effect of attempting to mutate, or even inspect, the list is undefined. The C implementation of Python makes the list appear empty for the duration, and raises if it can detect that the list has been mutated during a sort. Tuples are immutable sequences, typically used to store collections of heterogeneous data (such as the 2-tuples produced by the built-in). Tuples are also used for cases where an immutable sequence of homogeneous data is needed (such as allowing storage in a or instance). Tuples may be constructed in a number of ways:\n• None Using a pair of parentheses to denote the empty tuple:\n• None Using a trailing comma for a singleton tuple: or\n• None Using the built-in: or The constructor builds a tuple whose items are the same and in the same order as iterable’s items. iterable may be either a sequence, a container that supports iteration, or an iterator object. If iterable is already a tuple, it is returned unchanged. For example, returns and returns . If no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty tuple, . Note that it is actually the comma which makes a tuple, not the parentheses. The parentheses are optional, except in the empty tuple case, or when they are needed to avoid syntactic ambiguity. For example, is a function call with three arguments, while is a function call with a 3-tuple as the sole argument. Tuples implement all of the common sequence operations. For heterogeneous collections of data where access by name is clearer than access by index, may be a more appropriate choice than a simple tuple object. The type represents an immutable sequence of numbers and is commonly used for looping a specific number of times in loops. The arguments to the range constructor must be integers (either built-in or any object that implements the special method). If the step argument is omitted, it defaults to . If the start argument is omitted, it defaults to . If step is zero, is raised. For a positive step, the contents of a range are determined by the formula where and . For a negative step, the contents of the range are still determined by the formula , but the constraints are and . A range object will be empty if does not meet the value constraint. Ranges do support negative indices, but these are interpreted as indexing from the end of the sequence determined by the positive indices. Ranges containing absolute values larger than are permitted but some features (such as ) may raise . Ranges implement all of the common sequence operations except concatenation and repetition (due to the fact that range objects can only represent sequences that follow a strict pattern and repetition and concatenation will usually violate that pattern). The value of the start parameter (or if the parameter was not supplied) The value of the stop parameter The value of the step parameter (or if the parameter was not supplied) The advantage of the type over a regular or is that a object will always take the same (small) amount of memory, no matter the size of the range it represents (as it only stores the , and values, calculating individual items and subranges as needed). Range objects implement the ABC, and provide features such as containment tests, element index lookup, slicing and support for negative indices (see Sequence Types — list, tuple, range): Testing range objects for equality with and compares them as sequences. That is, two range objects are considered equal if they represent the same sequence of values. (Note that two range objects that compare equal might have different , and attributes, for example or .) Changed in version 3.2: Implement the Sequence ABC. Support slicing and negative indices. Test objects for membership in constant time instead of iterating through all items. Changed in version 3.3: Define ‘==’ and ‘!=’ to compare range objects based on the sequence of values they define (instead of comparing based on object identity).\n• None The linspace recipe shows how to implement a lazy version of range suitable for floating-point applications."

Python’s robust frameworks and libraries make it an ideal platform for building a feature-rich and secure ecommerce site. In this blog, we’ll explore the steps to create an ecommerce website using Python.\n\nPython is a high-level, multipurpose, and readable computer language that has a reputation for being clear and easy to understand. Guido van Rossum was the creator, and it was originally published in 1991. Python’s design philosophy emphasizes code readability and a clean, easy-to-understand syntax, which makes it an excellent language for both beginners and experienced developers.\n• None Readable and Clean Syntax: Python uses indentation and whitespace for structuring code, which enforces a clean and readable style. This helps make the code more human-friendly and reduces the potential for errors.\n• None Interpreted Language: Python is an interpreted language, meaning you can run code directly without the need for compilation. This makes development and debugging faster and more straightforward.\n• None High-Level Language: Python abstracts a lot of low-level details since it is a high-level language. This abstraction simplifies programming and allows developers to focus on solving problems rather than dealing with hardware-specific issues.\n• None Cross-Platform Compatibility: Python is available on a wide range of platforms, including Windows, macOS, and various flavors of Unix, making it a versatile choice for developing applications that can run on different operating systems.\n• None Rich Standard Library: Python comes with an extensive standard library that provides pre-written modules and functions to perform various tasks. This library makes it easier to do typical programming activities and minimizes the need to start from scratch.\n• None Python is dynamically typed, so you don’t have to explicitly specify the kinds of your variables.\n• None Python interprets the variable type at runtime, which can lead to more flexibility in coding.\n• None Strongly Typed: Despite being dynamically typed, Python is also strongly typed. This means that variable-type conversions must be handled explicitly, which helps avoid unexpected behavior.\n• None Open Source: Python is open-source, and it has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its growth and improvement. This community support results in numerous third-party libraries, frameworks, and tools.\n• None Versatile Usage: Python is used in various domains, including web development (with frameworks like Django and Flask), scientific computing (with libraries like NumPy and SciPy), data analysis (with pandas), machine learning and artificial intelligence (with TensorFlow and PyTorch), automation, and more.\n• None Extensibility: Python can be extended by integrating with other languages like C, C++, and Java, allowing developers to optimize performance-critical code when needed.\n\nAdvantages Of Using Python For Ecommerce Store Development\n\nPython offers several advantages for developing ecommerce stores, making it a strong choice for building robust and efficient online retail platforms. Here are some key advantages of using Python for ecommerce store development:\n• None Ease of Learning and Readability: Python’s clean and readable syntax makes it accessible to both beginners and experienced developers. This means that your development team can be more productive and onboard new developers quickly.\n• None Large and Active Community: Python has a vast and active developer community. This results in extensive documentation, a wealth of third-party libraries, and a strong ecosystem of tools and resources to support ecommerce development.\n• None Versatility: Python is a versatile language that can be used for various components of an ecommerce site, including the backend, frontend, data analysis, and machine learning. You can build, maintain, and scale your entire ecommerce ecosystem using Python.\n• None Extensive Standard Library: Python comes with a rich standard library that provides a wide range of modules and functions, reducing the need for developers to build everything from scratch. This library includes modules for handling data, working with databases, and interacting with web services, all of which are essential for ecommerce development.\n• None Powerful Frameworks: Python boasts powerful web development frameworks such as Django and Flask. These frameworks provide pre-built components for user authentication, database management, and routing, which significantly accelerates development and helps maintain code consistency.\n• None Scalability: Python’s scalability is a critical advantage for ecommerce stores. You can scale your ecommerce website both vertically (by adding more resources to a single server) and horizontally (by adding more servers). Python’s asynchronous programming capabilities and tools like Celery make it well-suited for handling increased loads.\n• None Security: Python is known for its strong security features, and it is often used for developing high-security applications.

Here are some of the key cost considerations when developing an ecommerce store with Python:\n• None Development Team: The most significant cost factor is the development team’s expenses. This includes the salaries or fees for developers, designers, and any other professionals you need, such as UX/UI designers, project managers, and quality assurance testers.\n• None Ecommerce Platform: The choice of ecommerce platform or framework matters. Python-based frameworks like Django and Flask are open-source and free to use. However, if you require customizations or decide to use a paid platform like Shopify or WooCommerce, there will be associated licensing and subscription costs.\n• None Hosting and Infrastructure: Hosting costs can vary depending on your site’s expected traffic and performance requirements. Shared hosting is typically more affordable, but for larger stores with more traffic, dedicated hosting or cloud services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud may be necessary, which can incur higher costs.\n• None Domain Name and SSL Certificate: Registering a domain name and obtaining an SSL certificate for secure transactions are ongoing costs associated with running an ecommerce website.\n• None Third-Party Services: Ecommerce sites often rely on third-party services for various functions, such as payment gateways, shipping providers, and analytics tools. These services may charge fees based on transaction volumes or usage.\n• None Customization and Features: The complexity of your ecommerce store’s features and customizations will significantly impact costs. For example, implementing advanced search functionality, product recommendations, and a personalized user experience can be more expensive.\n• None Design and User Experience: Creating an attractive and user-friendly design is important for ecommerce. Costs for design and user experience (UX) services can vary, especially if you need custom designs or branding.\n• None Testing and Quality Assurance: Ensuring that your ecommerce site functions correctly and is free of bugs and security vulnerabilities is crucial. Testing and quality assurance processes require time and resources.\n• None Maintenance and Updates: Post-launch, your ecommerce site will require ongoing maintenance, updates, and security patches. The cost of maintaining your site can be a recurring expense.\n• None Marketing and Promotion: Attracting customers to your ecommerce store requires marketing and promotion efforts, which can include digital marketing, social media advertising, and search engine optimization (SEO).\n• None Legal and Compliance: Legal aspects, such as privacy policies, terms and conditions, and compliance with regulations like GDPR, may require legal consultation and documentation, incurring additional costs.\n• None Content Creation: Creating product descriptions, images, and other content can also be a significant cost, especially for large inventories.\n\nHow To Create An Ecommerce Store Using Python?\n\nCreating an ecommerce store using Python involves several steps, from setting up your development environment to deploying the final site.\n• None Before you start coding, it’s crucial to plan your ecommerce store thoroughly. Define your goals, target audience, product catalog, and any unique features you want to include. Document the technical requirements and select the appropriate Python web framework for your project, such as Django or Flask.\n\nTo develop your ecommerce store using Python, you’ll need to set up a development environment. This typically involves the following:\n• None Install Python: Download and install the latest version of Python from the official website (\n• None Choose a Code Editor: Select a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or Sublime Text for writing your Python code.\n• None Set Up a Virtual Environment: It’s best practice to create a virtual environment for your project to isolate dependencies. You can use Python’s built-in venv module or tools like virtualenv or conda.\n\nSelect a Python web framework for your project. Two popular options for ecommerce development are:\n• None Django: Django is a high-level web framework known for its robust features, including an admin panel, built-in authentication, and an extensive ecosystem of plugins and libraries.\n• None Flask: Flask is a micro-framework that provides more flexibility and allows you to build a custom solution tailored to your project’s requirements.\n• None Design the database schema for your ecommerce store. Define the tables and relationships required to store product data, user information, orders, and any other relevant information. You can use Django’s Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for database management or SQLAlchemy with Flask.\n• None Implement user authentication to allow users to register, log in, and manage their accounts. Both Django and Flask provide tools and libraries for user authentication, making it easier to handle this critical aspect of your ecommerce store.\n• None Create the front end of your ecommerce store, including the user interface, product pages, and shopping cart. You can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build responsive and attractive web pages. Choose a frontend framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js if needed, or use template engines like Django’s built-in system or Jinja2 with Flask.\n• None Develop a product catalog to showcase your items with details like price, descriptions, images, and categories. Implement a search functionality that allows users to easily find products. Ensure that the product information is stored in your database.\n• None Create a shopping cart where users can add and remove items, and implement a smooth checkout process. This includes options for shipping, payment methods, and order confirmation. Integrate payment gateways like PayPal, Stripe, or others for secure transactions.\n• None Implement security measures to protect your ecommerce website. Use SSL encryption to secure data transmission, validate user inputs to prevent SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, and configure security headers for added protection.\n• None Before launching your ecommerce store, thoroughly test it for bugs, usability, and security vulnerabilities. Conduct several testing methods, such as user acceptability testing, integration testing, and unit testing.\n• None Once testing is complete and your site is ready, deploy it to a production server. You can use cloud services like AWS, Azure, or Heroku, or traditional web hosting providers.\n• None After launching your ecommerce store, be prepared for ongoing maintenance, updates, and security patches. Continuously monitor and improve your site to provide the best possible experience for your customers.\n\nHow Appic Softwares Can Help You Create An E-commerce Store Using Python?\n• None Python App Development: If you want to build an application using the Python programming language, Appic Softwares can provide development services.

        "document": "But the eponymous character from Quentin Tarantino’s masterpiece isn’t the only badass Django in town.\n\nSo is the popular Python framework of the same name.\n\nToday, I’m leaving the realm of JavaScript frameworks for a quick venture into Django e-commerce.\n\nIn this post, I’ll answer legitimate questions you might have when starting a new e-commerce project, such as:\n\nThen, I’ll show you our homemade recipe for Django-powered e-commerce success with a step-by-step Wagtail CMS tutorial:\n• Creating new products for your Django store.\n\nOne of the main reasons to pick Django as a framework is its Python foundation.\n\nA general purpose, dynamic programming language, Python was developed by ex-Googler Guido van Rossum in the late 80’s. A fan of Monthy Python, he took one-half of the name to baptize his programming project.\n\nHe wasn’t joking though. To say that Python has become “popular” is an understatement.\n\nToday, it’s used by hundreds of thousands of developers all over the world. As StackOverflow puts it:\n• It has a fast learning curve for newcomers.\n• It’s now the standard language for data science & machine learning.\n\nWhat about the Django framework?\n\nDjango is an open source, high-level Python web framework. Its emphasis on reusable components makes it faster for developers to build web apps on top of Python. It presents itself as a web framework for perfectionists with deadlines.\n\nNow maintained by the Django Software Foundation, it was originally written by two brilliant Lawrence Journal-World developers. Oh, and while Python draws its name from comedy icons, Django got his from a versatile guitar legend: Django Reinhardt!\n\nAs a full-stack framework, it overshadows pretty much any alternative tool out there. It’s fast, fully loaded, secure, scalable & versatile. All characteristics you’ll probably want to apply to your e-commerce setup!\n\nWhy use Django for e-commerce?\n\nWhile you can do a lot with Django, let’s keep the focus on what it brings to e-commerce and the different tools available to put together an online store.\n\nFirst, here are some Django features to consider if you’re looking for the right framework to build a shop.\n\nDjango is perfect for e-commerce startups, as it’s a good fit for small websites, but also has scales perfectly with business growth. You can rely on Django to handle hundreds/thousands of visitors at a time. It’s built with independent components you can unplug or replace depending on your needs at any specific time.\n\nWith e-commerce, you want to make sure merchants and clients alike feel safe through your shopping experience. Django prevents a whole lot of common security mistakes which often are what weakens traditional PHP CMSs. For instance, Django hides your site’s source code from direct viewing on the web by dynamically generating web pages.\n\nCompared to most frameworks, Django comes with way more features out-of-the-box. It allows you to build an app right off the bat. Perfect for supporting your online store with functionalities such as user authentification, content management or RSS feed. If something seems to be missing, you can count on Django’s community and plugins ecosystem to extend your app!\n\nSEO is paramount for any online business. While other frameworks don’t natively play well with search engines (mainly JavaScript frameworks, like Vue or React), at least Django advocates best practices for SEO. Human-readable URLs and sitemap features are sure to please any marketing team.\n\nOh and also, it’s fast. Which is always great for both customer experience and SEO.\n\nIt has been crowd-tested for a while now, and the community surrounding it is largely supportive. It’s continuously updated by active developers; maybe you’ll even find yourself contributing. ;)\n\nThere are a few noteworthy e-commerce solutions in the Python/Django ecosystem:\n\nYou can explore more options through this extensive list of the best e-commerce packages.\n\nNow let me present you another cool stack for a complete and custom e-commerce setup with Django.\n\nWagtail is a developer-first Django content management system. Free and open source, it was developed by the good-hearted folks at Torchbox. It’s elegant, flexible, and, IMHO, kicks ass.\n\nIn the following Wagtail tutorial, the CMS will be in charge of creating and managing products that users will then be able to buy through a shopping cart.\n\nBy the end of it, you’ll have a solid Django-powered e-commerce site up and running.\n\nMake sure you have Wagtail installed. If not, refer to their installation documentation.\n\nWe have an extra step to complete the Wagtail setup, and it’s to install the plugin that we'll require later on.\n\nIn your new Wagtail project, open the file located in folder. Then, add to the array.\n\nThe first thing you need to do is create your Page models. Wagtail uses these Django models to generate a page type.\n\nOpen the file located in the folder of your product. This is where you'll define all your custom models.\n\nLet’s make sure you can update the Snipcart API key directly from Wagtail’s dashboard. You’ll need to add site settings to do so.\n\nSite settings are special fields that you can add to your models file. They’ll appear in the Wagtail Settings section of the dashboard.\n\nNow that your models are created, you’ll need to generate database migrations and run them.\n\nIn your terminal, use the command:\n\nYou should see the following output:\n\nOnce the migrations are generated, apply them on your database with the command:\n\nIt will take a couple of seconds; Wagtail will set up its own database schema along with the models you just defined.\n\nFinally, create your first CMS user with the command:\n\nDon’t forget the username and password you picked — you will need them to log into Wagtail’s dashboard.\n\nStart by firing up your dev server with the Django dev server command:\n\nNow open your browser and navigate to: . Use the credentials you set up earlier to log in.\n\nSelect the page in Wagtail's menu. Then click on the .\n\nYou’ll be asked to pick a type of page, select .\n\nEnter the product details, then publish your new product:\n\nYou can create as many products as you wish.\n\nRemember the class you created? You'll be able to configure your API key by expanding the Settings menu and going to Snipcart settings.\n\nOpen Snipcart’s dashboard and get your public API key (Test or Live). Go back to Wagtail and paste it in the API key field.\n\nYour backend is now ready, your API key is configured, and your first products are created. Time to start building the site.\n\nFor this demo, I decided to use Spectre.css CSS framework. It’s straightforward and lightweight.\n\nYou’ll need to add references for Spectree.css and Snipcart. Add these lines in the of your document:\n\nThe Snipcart API key that you configured previously is available via:\n\nThen, add the navbar and some other layout elements.\n\nReplace the content of the whole by these lines:\n\nThe first template you need is your index, where products will be listed.\n\nYou’ll have to make your products available in your home page context. In any Wagtail Page, you can override a method name .\n\nYou can add the data that the view will receive in parameters. In my case, I want to set the context variable.\n\nOpen the file in folder and update the class:\n\nThen, open the file located in the folder.\n\nLet’s create a simple page that will show each product image with a link to the product details.\n\nThe last template is the one showing individual product details along with the Snipcart buy button.\n\nAlso, it would be nice to be able to select product options directly on this page, before adding it to the cart. So I’ll add a way to choose all custom fields with options directly in the template.\n\nBefore writing some HTML, you have to update the view context. Django templates don’t give us 100% access to all Python methods and objects, so things like splitting a string do not work very well.\n\nI decided to override the method again. Maybe there's a better way to do that—let me know in the comments below! ;)\n\nOpen from the and add this method in the class:\n\nA array will be available in the template.\n\nCreate a file named in folder. This is the template that will be associated with the page model.\n\nThen, add some JavaScript to update the Snipcart buy button when a custom field selection is made on the page.\n\nAdd the following snippet before the statement:\n\nThis code updates the button data attributes when the value changes.\n\nIf you click on the button beside any product, you should see its details:\n\nYou now have pretty strong foundations to start your e-commerce project using Django and Wagtail!\n\nThese frameworks are very powerful. You could quickly add some search functionalities, product suggestions, reviews, etc.\n\nI really enjoyed working with Wagtail, as it’s simple and intuitive. I have to say that their documentation feels incomplete at times, though. At first, I wanted to make some changes on how routing would work and haven’t found anything in their docs about that.\n\nI didn’t have Python installed on my laptop at the start, so setting up everything and having this demo up and running took me about a day, including hosting the demo. I figure it would be way faster for avid Python developers!\n\nFor further exploration, I think Wagtail could be a great headless CMS, especially with their built-in API. I think it could be cool to leverage it and strap it to tools like Nuxt or Gatsby to handle the front end.\n\nIf you’ve enjoyed this post, please take a second to share it on Twitter.

        "document": "Ecommerce product pages’ SEO needs special attention because these pages are the cornerstones of an ecommerce store. They convey information about products and help convert visitors into buyers. You can consider product pages as your sales pitch to attract website visitors.\n\nThere are a substantial number of ecommerce websites available on the internet, out of which, how many are your competitors? Well, you must be having ample competitors with similar product-line. Thus, to survive competition, you need to apply more reliable strategies that assist your ecommerce store to stand out and earn more loyal customers.\n\nRight from content and visual elements to the links on the product pages, myriad factors need to be optimized in order to boost user experience, visibility among users, and ranking in search engines.\n\nRead the article to know SEO for ecommerce product pages including best practices and mistakes that you must avoid.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE: Ecommerce UX Best Practices\n\nWhen it comes to ecommerce SEO, it is not about a single page, but a whole big site with several product pages. And obviously, they impact one another’s performances which is why every page optimization is necessary.\n\nSearch engines review your entire ecommerce website; not a single page will be left behind unless you’ve kept any page under noindex tag or page have some certain issues. While optimizing product pages, do not overlook category and product pages competing for the same keywords. It will impact page ranking.\n\nMoreover, ecommerce product pages require regular updates by removing expired or discontinued products and almost alike product variants. Updating all this information on time in each product page can be overwhelming but mandatory for product page SEO.\n\nThe immense popularity of ecommerce stores makes this industry more competitive. Reaching your target audience and persuading them to buy from your ecommerce store is not an easy task anymore. You need to follow SEO best practices and keep executing them in a loop to maintain the store’s performance.\n\n1. Keyword strategy should be aligned with product names\n\nThe more accurate keywords you will use in your product pages; the more potential traffic will land on these pages.\n\nInstead of using one- or two-words keywords, try including more information in keywords to make it comprehensive for users. For example, if you are dealing into cosmetics, you can use keyword for a lipstick brand as ‘Maybeline 234 Lilac Matt’, which is a good keyword from SEO point of view. Here Maybeline is brand name, 234 is its model number, lilac is colour and matt is its variant. Thus, if a user will search for lilac color lipstick, the product can appear for that query.\n\nAlso, product pages and category pages should not compete for similar keywords. To avoid such situations, pages must be optimized for product specific queries.\n\nKeeping URLs simple and relevant helps users and Google understand your site structure easily. If your snippets will reflect users’ queries, they are most likely to click on your URLs. And most importantly, URLs should be self-explanatory for users and search engines.\n\nYou can add brand names and some other specifications along with product name to make URLs more descriptive. If an URL has the primary keyword, Google is more likely to rank higher such product pages.\n\nCheck auto numbers, and characters and remove them to protect the unwanted length of the URLs.\n\nTo optimize product titles, include product names and keywords in them. Try to keep titles within 60 characters; thus, they will appear unbroken in search snippets. A descriptive title gives a clear idea of the products to the users, and they are most likely click on such titles.\n\nAny idea, why your product pages are not performing well in SERPs, even after putting in much effort?\n\nThe reason can be poor presentation or incomplete/wrong description. A well-written product description helps users understand the products and persuades them to make up their mind to buy the product. Adding most relevant primary keyword into product description is a SEO practice; however, over-stuffing of keywords can be harmful.\n\nSimilarly, a purchase intent meta description attracts users and makes them click on the link. Meta descriptions must be concise, optimized, and straightforward. If product and meta description is unique, it helps your product pages to rank higher in SERPs.\n\nStructured data in SEO is important because it provides extra context to search engines that help your product pages to stand out. This is called structured data and it works in your favor by helping search engines to understand the content and purpose of product pages, provides a more prominent appearance in organic search listings.\n\nProduct pages must have a FAQ section, where you list down all the common queries about products. It helps customers to clear their doubts before they purchase the product. FAQ is a handy guide for customers to understand more about a product.\n\nDon’t hesitate to share reviews and comments from real customers. A product with more reviews is likely to sell more than products with fewer reviews. Potential customers check reviews before they buy a new product. The reviews give them a sense of assurance that the products and brands are reliable.\n\n8. All media files should be optimized.\n\nAdding visual content on product pages makes them more appealing. But make sure you optimize all the media files to avoid performance issues. Images, infographics, charts, videos, diagrams, GIFs, screenshots, etc. must be optimized for SEO. Search engine ranks such optimized content which has relevant visual elements that demonstrate the features and benefits of products.\n\nBreadcrumbs are the navigational links that help users to navigate through your ecommerce product pages and they appear on the top of the page. Breadcrumbs let users know where they are in your ecommerce store, and they can easily return to any place if they’ve to go back. It also generates internal links among pages and boosts product page SEO.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE: Breadcrumbs in Web Design\n\n10. Encompass more product options with ‘You may also like’ section\n\nThis section is a promising idea to engage those visitors who are confused or wish to see more products. They might find some additional products interesting and buy them. Related products not only increase sales, but they also have additional SEO value. They are the links to given products pages, which build robust internal linking.\n\nThis functionality can be implemented with model windows to offer a quick look of a product with its information in it to save user’s time. Quick view provides more content and context to search engines and users and improves SEO of the product page.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE: Customer Experience vs User Experience\n\nIf a user lands on your category page and if first product in the product list is not favourable for you, then somewhere you are lacking in encashing the opportunities if the user will leave the page without taking an action. Design such algorithms that help you put profit-enhancing products before others in the product lists.\n\nYou can measure some metrics like sales statistics, percentage margin, stock availability, user’s location, etc. to decide how to list the products.\n\nYou should audit your ecommerce product pages every now and then to make sure there is no technical error that will influence the SEO of your website. Issues like duplicate content, broken links, 404 error, wastage on crawl budget, etc. harm ecommerce SEO badly.\n• Ensure to implement XML sitemap and robots.txt files to let Google know about your product pages.\n• To avoid the duplicate content issue, add canonical tags. These tags improve product pages’ SEO by informing Google that a specific URL has original information. This is helpful for huge ecommerce websites with several pages and colossal data.\n• Optimize your ecommerce crawl budget to get better rankings in SERPs.\n• Fix all the broken links and errors (like 404, 302. etc.).\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE: Technical SEO for Ecommerce\n• Don’t remove the seasonal pages once the deal or season has passed. If that seasonal page builds ranking and traffic for your ecommerce website, then use that page to continue with some other content or deals.\n• Don’t use automated optimization because it may have some unwanted variables and automation is also not unique.\n• Don’t pull out-of-stock pages; let such pages be live and link them with other product pages until the product is back in stock.\n\nOptimizing product pages is essential in order to have a thriving ecommerce business. Your ecommerce store cannot have good ranking in search engines if you avoid technical and on-page SEO.\n\n“SEO is like a resume, you polish it, so you have your best foot forward.” - Matt Cutts\n\nThus, start polishing your ecommerce product pages’ SEO to get the most out of it!\n\nEcommerce SEO is complex and should be done by experienced SEOs.

If not, refer to their installation documentation.\n\nWe have an extra step to complete the Wagtail setup, and it's to install the plugin that we'll require later on.\n\nIn your new Wagtail project, open the file located in folder. Then, add to the array.\n\nThe first thing you need to do is create your Page models. Wagtail uses these Django models to generate a page type.\n\nOpen the file located in the folder of your product. This is where you'll define all your custom models.\n\nLet's make sure you can update the Snipcart API key directly from Wagtail's dashboard.\n\nYou'll need to add site settings to do so.\n\nSite settings are special fields that you can add to your models.py file. They'll appear in the section of the dashboard.\n\nNow that your models are created, you'll need to generate database migrations and run them.\n\nIn your terminal, use the command:\n\nYou should see the following output:\n\nOnce the migrations are generated, apply them to your database with the command:\n\nIt will take a couple of seconds; Wagtail will set up its own database schema along with the models you just defined.\n\nFinally, create your first CMS user with the command:\n\nIt will ask for an email address, a username, and to create a password. Don't forget the username and password you picked; you will need them to log into Wagtail's dashboard.\n\nStart by firing up your dev server with the Django dev server command:\n\nNow open your browser and navigate to . Use the credentials you set up earlier to log in.\n\nSelect the page in Wagtail's menu. Then click on the .\n\nYou'll be asked to pick a type of page, select and give it a name.\n\nGo back to the page menu and click under your newly created page.\n\nOnce again, you'll be asked to pick a type of page, this time select .\n\nEnter the product details, then publish your new product:\n\nYou can create as many products as you wish.\n\nRemember the class you created? You'll be able to configure your API key by expanding the menu and going to .\n\nOpen Snipcart's dashboard and get your public API key (Test or Live), go back to Wagtail, and paste it in the API key field.\n\nYour backend is now ready, your API key is configured, and your first products are created—time to start building the site.\n\nFor this demo, I decided to use the Tailwind CSS framework. It enables you to build any design directly in your HTML rapidly.\n\nCreate a new directory within your Django project, in which you’ll install Tailwind CSS like in any Vanilla.js project setup:\n\nIn this file located in , add:\n\nIn this tailwind.css file, add this:\n\nNow, add a script in your jstoolchain/package.json (create a package.json if it’s not already there) file to create the build process and specify the output file, such as:\n\nThis should run without error, and tailwind-output.css should now be filled with thousands of lines.\n\nNow you can actually use Tailwind CSS classes by including the outputted CSS file into a Django template file along with Django’s call to load the static files:\n\nTo ease development, what’s missing now is to auto-reload the Django development server when an HTML file is changed and saved. For this, I installed django-livereload-server. Just follow setup instructions. This will work as expected out of the box, without any special configuration.\n\nWhen you’re ready to deploy, to ensure the CSS output file is not bloated with useless classes, go to jstoolchain/tailwind.config.js file, and add:\n\nYour backend is now ready, your API key is configured, and your first products are created—time to start building the site.\n\nYou'll need to add references for tailwind-output.css and Snipcart. Add these lines in the of your document :\n\nThe Snipcart API key that you configured previously is available via:\n\nThen, add the navbar and some other layout elements.\n\nReplace the with these lines:\n\nThe first template you need is your index, where products will be listed.\n\nYou'll have to make your products available in your home page context. In any Wagtail Page, you can override a method name .\n\nYou can add the data that the view will receive in parameters. In my case, I want to set the context variable.\n\nOpen the file in the folder and update the class:\n\nThen, open the file located in the folder.\n\nLet's create a simple home page with a button linking to our shop page.\n\nNow we want to display our products on the shop page with a button linking to the product page.\n\nAdd this to the before :\n\nThe last template is the one showing individual product details along with the Snipcart buy button.\n\nAlso, it would be nice to be able to select product options directly on this page before adding them to the cart. So I'll add a way to choose all custom fields with options directly in the template.\n\nBefore writing some HTML, you have to update the view context. Django templates don't give us 100% access to all Python methods and objects, so things like splitting a string do not work very well.\n\nI decided to override the method again. Maybe there's a better way to do that—let me know in the comments below! 😉\n\nAlso, it would be nice to select product options directly on this page before adding them to the cart.

This is the template that will be associated with the page model.\n\nThen, add some JavaScript to update the Snipcart buy button when a custom field selection is made on the page.\n\nAdd the following snippet before the statement:\n\nThis code updates the button data attributes when the value changes.\n\nYou now have pretty strong foundations to start your e-commerce project using Django and Wagtail!\n\nThese frameworks are very powerful; you could quickly add search functionalities, product suggestions, reviews, etc.\n\nI really enjoyed working with Wagtail; it's simple and intuitive. I have to say that their documentation feels incomplete at times, though. At first, I wanted to change how routing would work and haven't found anything in their docs.\n\nOn the other hand, Tailwind CSS was a joy to work with. Their documentation is beautiful, intuitive, and well documented.\n\nI didn't have the latest version of Python installed on my laptop (a Mac) at the start, so setting up everything and having this demo up and running took me some time. The hosting of the demo was also a bit of a hurdle. I figure it would be way faster for avid Python developers!\n\nFor further exploration, I think Wagtail could be a great headless CMS, especially with its built-in API.\n\nOverall I enjoyed my little venture with Django, Wagtail CMS, and Tailwind CSS. I think it could be cool to leverage it and strapping it to tools like Next.js or Gatsby to handle the front end.\n\nLet me know in the comments your experience using these tools."
