        "document": "As I work a lot with Large Language Models (LLMs), I often have to deal with flaky test cases, because LLMs are not always consistent and deterministic in their responses. Thus, sometimes, a test passes maybe a few times in a row, but then, once in a while, it fails.\n\nMaybe some prompt tweaks will make the test pass more consistently, lowering the temperature too, or using techniques like few-shot prompting will help the model better understand what it has to do. But in some circumenstances, you can’t find ways around those weird failures, and the sole solution I found was to make a test retryable.\n\nIf a test fails, let’s retry a few more times (2 or 3 times) till it passes. But if it fails everytime in spite of the retries, then it’ll just fail as expected.\n\nI wrote JUnit Rules in the past for such situations, but that was in the JUnit 4 days. Now, I’m using JUnit 5, and although it’s possible to make JUnit 4 tests run under JUnit 5, I thought it was a great opportunity to try creating a JUnit 5 extension, which is the more powerful mechanism that replaces JUnit 4 rules.\n\nIt all starts with a failing test case\n\nLet’s say you have an hypothetical flaky test that fails a few times in a row:\n\nThe first 3 executions will see an assertion failure, but the 4th would succeed as the counter is then equal to .\n\nI’d like to annotate this test method with a custom annotation that indicates the number of times I’m ready to retry that test:\n\nThis annotation indicates that I’m registering a JUnit 5 extension. And is a custom annotation that I’ve created.\n\nNote that can be at the class-level, but it can also live at the method level.\n\nLet’s have a look at the annotation:\n\nBy default, I attempt the test 3 times, if no number is provided for the annotation value.\n\nNow it’s time to see how the extension code works:\n\nLet’s go through the code step by step:\n• The extension has a counter to count the number of executions\n• a method is used to report the assertion failure or exception\n• That interface requires the method to be implemented\n• This method is invoked when a test throws some exception\n• If an exception is thrown, let’s see if the method is annotated with the annotation\n• and let’s retrieve the number of attempts demanded by the developer\n• Then let’s loop to do some more executions of the test method, until it passes or up to the number of attempts\n\nI thought a extension would be pretty common, and that it would be integrated in JUnit 5 directly. Or at least, some library would provide common JUnit 5 extensions? But my search didn’t yield anything meaningful. Did I overlook or miss something?\n\nAt least now, I have a solution to work around some flaky tests, thanks to this retryable extension!\n\nIf you want to learn more about JUnit 5 extensions, there were a few resources that helped me develop this extension. First of all, two artciles from Baeldung on Migrating from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5 to understand the changes since JUnit 4, and this Guide to JUnit 5 Extensions. And of course, the JUnit 5 documentation on extensions.\n\nI’m glad I shared this article on Twitter, because I immediately got a response! Thanks @donal_tweets for your answer! The JUnit Pioneer library provides a JUnit 5 extension pack, which includes a powerful retrying extension. Replace the usual annotation with . You can specify the number of attempts, the minimum number of successes, or some wait time before retries. There’s also a rerunner extension that is quite similar. My friend @aheritier also suggested that Maven Surefire can be configured to automatically retry failing tests a few times, thanks to a special flag: In my case, I don’t want to retry all failing tests, but only a specific one that I know is flaky. For those who prefer Gradle over Maven, there’s a Gradle plugin as well: test-retry. You can configure the behavior in your file: Someone also suggested me to use fuzzy assertions, but my test is very binary as it either fails or succeeds. There’s no threshold, or value that would fit within some bounds."

As JUnit 5.0.0 was released nearly 1 year ago, it is unclear if and when it will be supported in Maven.\n\nAnd, even if it will be supported in Maven in the future, it could be good to have a special annotation to specify that only some tests are expected to be flaky, and not all of them.\n\nAt the moment, the workaround is to stick with JUnit 4, which is a kind of a shame as JUnit 5 has a lot of interesting features :( (which I can only use in projects with no flaky tests)"

        "document": "In this article, we’re going to take a look at the extension model in the JUnit 5 testing library. As the name suggests, the purpose of Junit 5 extensions is to extend the behavior of test classes or methods, and these can be reused for multiple tests.\n\nBefore Junit 5, the JUnit 4 version of the library used two types of components for extending a test: test runners and rules. By comparison, JUnit 5 simplifies the extension mechanism by introducing a single concept: the Extension API.\n\nJUnit 5 extensions are related to a certain event in the execution of a test, referred to as an extension point. When a certain life cycle phase is reached, the JUnit engine calls registered extensions.\n\nFive main types of extension points can be used:\n\nWe’ll go through each of these in more detail in the following sections.\n\nFirst, let’s add the project dependencies we will need for our examples. The main JUnit 5 library we’ll need is junit-jupiter-engine:\n\nAlso, let’s also add two helper libraries to use for our examples:\n\nThe latest versions of junit-jupiter-engine, h2 and log4j-core can be downloaded from Maven Central.\n\nTo create a JUnit 5 extension, we need to define a class which implements one or more interfaces corresponding to the JUnit 5 extension points. All of these interfaces extend the main Extension interface, which is only a marker interface.\n\nThis type of extension is executed after an instance of a test has been created. The interface to implement is TestInstancePostProcessor which has a postProcessTestInstance() method to override.\n\nA typical use case for this extension is injecting dependencies into the instance. For example, let’s create an extension which instantiates a logger object, then calls the setLogger() method on the test instance:\n\nAs can be seen above, the postProcessTestInstance() method provides access to the test instance and calls the setLogger() method of the test class using the mechanism of reflection.\n\nJUnit 5 provides a type of extension that can control whether or not a test should be run. This is defined by implementing the ExecutionCondition interface.\n\nLet’s create an EnvironmentExtension class which implements this interface and overrides the evaluateExecutionCondition() method.\n\nThe method verifies if a property representing the current environment name equals “qa” and disables the test in this case:\n\nAs a result, tests that register this extension will not be run on the “qa” environment.\n\nIf we do not want a condition to be validated, we can deactivate it by setting the junit.conditions.deactivate configuration key to a pattern that matches the condition.\n\nThis can be achieved by starting the JVM with the -Djunit.conditions.deactivate=<pattern> property, or by adding a configuration parameter to the LauncherDiscoveryRequest:\n\nThis set of extensions is related to events in a test’s lifecycle and can be defined by implementing the following interfaces:\n• BeforeAllCallback and AfterAllCallback – executed before and after all the test methods are executed\n• BeforeEachCallBack and AfterEachCallback – executed before and after each test method\n• BeforeTestExecutionCallback and AfterTestExecutionCallback – executed immediately before and immediately after a test method\n\nIf the test also defines its lifecycle methods, the order of execution is:\n\nFor our example, let’s define a class which implements some of these interfaces and controls the behavior of a test that accesses a database using JDBC.\n\nWe will also need a utility class that creates a Connection based on a .properties file:\n\nLet’s create our extension which implements some of the lifecycle interfaces:\n\nEach of these interfaces contains a method we need to override.\n\nFor the BeforeAllCallback interface, we will override the beforeAll() method and add the logic to create our employees table before any test method is executed:\n\nNext, we will make use of the BeforeEachCallback and AfterEachCallback to wrap each test method in a transaction. The purpose of this is to roll back any changes to the database executed in the test method so that the next test will run on a clean database.\n\nIn the beforeEach() method, we will create a save point to use for rolling back the state of the database to:\n\nThen, in the afterEach() method, we’ll roll back the database changes made during the execution of a test method:\n\nTo close the connection, we’ll make use of the afterAll() method, executed after all the tests have finished:\n\nIf a test constructor or method receives a parameter, this must be resolved at runtime by a ParameterResolver.\n\nLet’s define our own custom ParameterResolver that resolves parameters of type EmployeeJdbcDao:\n\nOur resolver implements the ParameterResolver interface and overrides the supportsParameter() and resolveParameter() methods. The first of these verify the type of the parameter, while the second defines the logic to obtain a parameter instance.\n\nLast but not least, the TestExecutionExceptionHandler interface can be used to define the behavior of a test when encountering certain types of exceptions.\n\nFor example, we can create an extension which will log and ignore all exceptions of type FileNotFoundException, while rethrowing any other type:\n\nNow that we have defined our test extensions, we need to register them with a JUnit 5 test. To achieve this, we can make use of the @ExtendWith annotation.\n\nThe annotation can be added multiple time to a test, or receive a list of extensions as a parameter:\n\nWe can see our test class has a constructor with an EmployeeJdbcDao parameter which will be resolved by extending the EmployeeDaoParameterResolver extension.\n\nBy adding the EnvironmentExtension, our test will only be executed in an environment different than “qa”.\n\nOur test will also have the employees table created and each method wrapped in a transaction by adding the EmployeeDatabaseSetupExtension. Even if the whenAddEmployee_thenGetEmploee() test is executed first, which adds one record to the table, the second test will find 0 records in the table.\n\nA logger instance will be added to our class by using the LoggingExtension.\n\nFinally, our test class will ignore all FileNotFoundException instances, since it is adding the corresponding extension.\n\nIf we want to register an extension for all tests in our application, we can do so by adding the fully qualified name to the /META-INF/services/org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.Extension file:\n\nFor this mechanism to be enabled, we also need to set the junit.jupiter.extensions.autodetection.enabled configuration key to true. This can be done by starting the JVM with the –Djunit.jupiter.extensions.autodetection.enabled=true property, or by adding a configuration parameter to LauncherDiscoveryRequest:\n\nAlthough registering extensions using annotations is a more declarative and unobtrusive approach, it has a significant disadvantage: we can’t easily customize the extension behavior. For example, with the current extension registration model, we can’t accept the database connection properties from the client.\n\nIn addition to the declarative annotation-based approach, JUnit provides an API to register extensions programmatically. For example, we can retrofit the JdbcConnectionUtil class to accept the connection properties:\n\nAlso, we should add a new constructor for the EmployeeDatabaseSetupExtension extension to support customized database properties:\n\nNow, to register the employee extension with custom database properties, we should annotate a static field with the @RegisterExtension annotation:\n\nHere, we’re connecting to an in-memory H2 database to run the tests.\n\nJUnit registers @RegisterExtension static fields after registering extensions that are declaratively defined using the @ExtendsWith annotation. We can also use non-static fields for programmatic registration, but they will be registered after the test method instantiation and post processors.\n\nIf we register multiple extensions programmatically, via @RegisterExtension, JUnit will register those extensions in a deterministic order. Although the ordering is deterministic, the algorithm used for the ordering is non-obvious and internal. To enforce a particular registration ordering, we can use the @Order annotation:\n\nHere, extensions are ordered based on priority, where a lower value has greater priority than a higher value. Also, extensions with no @Order annotation would have the lowest possible priority.\n\nIn this tutorial, we have shown how we can make use of the JUnit 5 extension model to create custom test extensions."

        "document": "JUnit is one of the most popular unit testing frameworks in the Java ecosystem. The JUnit 5 version (also known as Jupiter) contains many exciting innovations, including support for new features in Java 8 and above. However, many developers still prefer to use the JUnit 4 framework since certain features like parallel execution with JUnit 5 are still in the experimental phase.\n\nBarring a few minor things aside, JUnit 5 still represents a major step forward in test framework evolution as it provides advanced annotations that let you test reactive applications. As per my experience, JUnit 5 is the best JUnit version yet. The new framework also brings in an extensible architecture and a brand-new extension model that makes it super easy to implement custom features.\n\nIn this JUnit Tutorial, we deep dive into JUnit 5 extensions – one of the major features of the JUnit 5 framework. To delve deeper into the realm of JUnit, explore our dedicated hub focusing on Junit interview questions.\n\nIf you have used the JUnit 4 framework, you would agree that there are reduced (or minimal) possibilities of extending or customizing the JUnit 4 framework. This is one of the biggest bottlenecks in that version of the JUnit framework. In JUnit 4, extensions like Runners can be created by simply annotating the test class with @RunWith(MyRunner.class) so that JUnit can use them.\n\nThe downside of this approach is that you use only one Runner for a test class. This makes it difficult to compose with multiple runners. However, the shortcomings posed by Runners with JUnit 4 can be overcome using the below options:\n• JUnit 4 uses the Rules in addition to Runners that provides you a flexible solution to add or redefine the behavior of each test method.\n• Rules can be created to annotate fields of the test class. However, Rules suffers from a constancy problem. In simple terms, Rules can only be executed before and after a test is run but can’t be implemented within the test.\n\nSo, how does the JUnit 5 framework solve this lingering problem of JUnit 4? JUnit 5 offers an extension mechanism that opens third-party tools or APIs through the extension model. It consists of a single and coherent concept of Extension APIs to overcome the limitations of competing JUnit 4’s extension points (i.e., Runner, TestRule, and MethodRule).\n\nNow that we have covered a gist about JUnit 5 Extensions, here are the immediate set of questions that pops up for Java developers:\n• Why should we use extensions?\n• How much effort is involved in coming with JUnit 5 extensions?\n• Is the extension model better than the “Programming Model”?\n\nHere is what is mentioned in JUnit 5’s core principles:\n\nThe previous versions of the JUnit framework (i.e., till JUnit 4) were delivered in a single jar. However, JUnit 5 is architecturally different from the earlier JUnit versions. Therefore, JUnit 5 is delivered in different modules to meet the new architecture that separates API, Execution engine, Execution, and Integration.\n\nJUnit 5 can only be used with Java versions greater than or equal to 8. Here are the three modules that make up the JUnit 5 framework:\n• JUnit Platform: Provides an API for tools to discover and run tests. It defines an interface between JUnit and customers who want to run the tests from IDEs, build tools, or console.\n• JUnit Jupiter: Provides an annotation-based API to write JUnit 5 unit tests, along with a test engine that lets you run them.\n• JUnit Vintage: Offers a test engine to run JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 tests, thereby ensuring backward compatibility (with earlier versions of the JUnit framework).\n\nThe goal of this architecture is to separate the responsibilities of testing, execution, and extensions. It also facilitates the integration of other test frameworks with the JUnit framework.\n\nIf you are a QA engineer who writes tests on a regular basis, you are sure to use the programming model. On the other hand, the Extension model provides several interfaces as extension APIs that can be implemented by extension providers (developers or tool vendors) to extend the core functionality of JUnit 5.\n\nAs seen in the JUnit 5 architecture shown above, the extension model is a part of the Jupiter module that lets you extend the core features of JUnit 5 through flexible and powerful extensions. In addition, the JUnit 5 extension overcomes the limitations of the JUnit 4 extension by replacing Runners and Rules, its competing extension mechanisms. Finally, since JUnit 5 provides backward compatibility, you can still run JUnit 4 tests with JUnit 5.\n\nThe extension model of JUnit Jupiter is exposed through a small interface in org.junit.jupiter.api.extension package that can be used by developers or extension providers.\n\nNow that we have covered the essentials of JUnit 5 Extensions let’s get our hands dirty with code that illustrates a JUnit 5 extension example. For doing so, let’s create a Java project with three test cases in a Java class using the Eclipse IDE:\n\nIn case you are familiar with other Java IDE (apart from Eclipse), you can check our detailed blog that deep-dives into How to run JUnit from the Eclipse IDE. After adding the JUnit 5 library to the build path (or adding dependencies for the Maven project), we see that the JUnit 5 extension is in the org.junit.jupiter.api in the org.junit.jupiter.api.extension package as shown below:\n\nHere is a sample Java implementation that showcases a simple JUnit 5 extension example:\n\nAs seen in the above implementation, we have used JUnit annotations related to the test execution lifecycle, which we will discuss at a later point in time.\n\nLambdaTest has come up with free JUnit certification for Java developers that would help accelerate your career in Java development and testing. A short glimpse of the JUnit certification from LambdaTest:\n\nExtension registration in JUnit 5 is done to register one or more extensions via Java’s ServiceLoader mechanism. There are three ways of registering extensions: Declaratively, Programmatically, and Automatically.\n\nRegistration of one or more extensions can be done using annotations on the test interface, test class (or its field), or test method depending on the type of registration:\n• Declarative registration: The @ExtendWith(classReference.class) annotation\n\n should be used for applying the extension to class fields, test interfaces, test methods, or custom composed annotations To demonstrate this using a JUnit 5 extension example, we have used a sample that shows the handling of test result exceptions: We have used @ExtendWith (AdditionalOutputExtension.class) annotation to register the above class so that the JUnit framework can use it at a later stage.\n• Programmatic registration: We can use the @RegisterExtension annotation by applying them to fields in test classes: public class WebServerDemo { @RegisterExtension static WebServerExtension server = WebServerExtension.builder() .enableSecurity(false) .build(); @Test void getProductList() { WebClient webClient = new WebClient(); String serverUrl = server.getServerUrl(); // Use WebClient to connect to web server using serverUrl and verify response assertEquals(200, webClient.get(serverUrl + \"/products\").getResponseStatus()); } } // Use WebClient to connect to web server using serverUrl and verify response\n• Automatic registration: We can use java.util.ServiceLoader to auto-detect and register third-party extensions.\n\nFor starters, conditional test execution allows test cases to be run (enabled) or skipped (disabled) based on certain conditions via the org.junit.jupiter.api.condition API. Let’s look at how annotations of the condition package can be used for realizing conditional test execution in JUnit 5.\n\nOperating system conditions can be used with @EnabledOnOs and @DisabledOnOs annotations. The conditions help in running the JUnit 5 test on a particular platform (or operating system).\n\nTest cases can be run under certain conditions related to JRE (Java Runtime Environment) or on a certain range of the JRE version’s range using @EnabledOnJre, @DisabledOnJre, and @EnabledForJreRange annotations.\n\nTest cases can be enabled or disabled based on the system property using the @EnabledIfSystemProperty and/or @DisabledIfSystemProperty annotations.\n\nJUnit 5 test cases can be enabled or disabled based on the condition (or value) of the environment variables. This can be done using @EnabledIfEnvironmentVariable and @DisabledIfEnvironmentVariable annotations in the JUnit 5 framework.\n\nCustom conditions can be set to enable or disable test cases via the ExecutionCondition extension API. Here are the two ways through which you can implement test cases that run under particular (custom) conditions:\n• Combine built-in annotations to create a custom annotation that can be used later as a test condition. The combined built-in annotations inside the test condition can be used as an annotation inside a test class. It will help to define conditions under which the test should be performed. public class CustomBuiltInTest { @RunOnlyOn64bitWindows10 void runOnlyOn64bitWindows10() { System.out.println(\"Run only this on 64-bit Windows 10 System.\"); } } \"Run only this on 64-bit Windows 10 System.\"\n• Custom annotation can be created from scratch using the ExecutionCondition extension API. Using this approach, you can get around without using the built-in annotations. To demonstrate custom annotations using the JUnit 5 extension example, we run tests under the condition of the runtime environment (i.e., the environment could be development, QA, or production) as shown below: Here, the condition to run the add () test is executed in the test or development environment (not live). Here is how you can create the @Environment annotation from scratch and implement it in the JUnit 5 extension example:\n• We create an Environment.java file and set the enabledFor attribute to add parameters on it. Next, the created annotation must register the condition extension through the EnvironmentExecutionCondition file using the @ExtendWith annotation.\n• Create the EnvironmentExecutionCondition file where all the conditions are going to be specified on implementation of the ExecutionCondition API.\n\nWhen running tests in the Dev or QA environment, the “add” test will be active and executed, whereas the tests will not run if you are in the Prod environment.\n\nTo execute the tests in a given environment, run the appropriate command on VM arguments under the “run configurations” parameter:\n\nRead – How To Run Junit Tests From The Command Line\n\nHow to create JUnit 5 extensions by implementing TestInstanceFactory\n\nWe can create JUnit 5 extensions by implementing the TestInstanceFactory API for creating test class instances. These should run before the execution of each test method.\n\nThe created test instance can then be acquired from a dependency injection framework or by invoking a static factory method to create it.\n\nThe following JUnit 5 extension example demonstrates the use of test instance factories on outer and inner classes:\n\nHow to test lifecycle callbacks in JUnit 5\n\nLifecycle callbacks are functions that are automatically executed before or after certain model methods. For example, you can use lifecycle callbacks to automatically compute the value of a ‘full name’ attribute before creating or updating a user record.\n\nIn the primary test instance lifecycle, JUnit 5 defines class and method’s lifecycle driven by the following annotations:\n\nMethods annotated with @BeforeAll and @AfterAll should be executed before and after all test methods in the class. On the other hand, methods annotated by @BeforeEach and @AfterEach should be executed respectively before and after each test method.\n\nJUnit creates a new instance for the test class before running each test in the test instance lifecycle. This behavior aims to run each test separately and thus avoid the side effects of running other tests.\n\nThe above execution gives the following result:\n\nFrom the test execution result, the default behavior is the ‘Per Method Lifecycle’:\n\nThe default behavior of the test life cycle can be changed using the @org.junit.jupiter.api.TestInstance API, which allows the change of the default lifecycle (for a test class or a test method). This can be done by adding @TestInstance(TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_CLASS) annotation to the test class.\n\nHere is the updated execution result after the modification of default behavior (of the test life cycle):\n\nFrom the test execution result, the modified behavior gives the ‘Per Class Lifecycle’:\n\nIn addition to the per class and per method lifecycle, JUnit 5 Jupiter offers different interfaces that define APIs for extending tests at various points in the execution lifecycle. JUnit 5, therefore, calls extensions callbacks to implement the behavior.\n\nThe APIs are a part of the org.junit.jupiter.api.extension package. Here are the APIs that define the extension lifecycle:\n\nWe can create an extension applied to a test class by implementing the BeforeAllCallback, AfterAllCallback, BeforeEachCallback, and AfterEachCallback interfaces.\n\nHere is how to apply the said extension point to a test class:\n\nHere is the execution result:\n\nThe Juniper extensions model provides the ability to post-process test instances after creating test instances by implementing the TestInstancePostProcessor interface. As per the test instance factory, it can invoke the initialization method on the test instance by using, for example, injection dependencies into the instance to use the test instance post-procession.\n\nTo illustrate this, We take the case of a logging system from the log4j API, which executes and writes logs after each test execution. Let’s check further details in this JUnit 5 exception example:\n\nThe extension model also defines the API for extensions that need to be processed between the test instances and their final destruction. For example, the test instance pre-destroy callback is commonly used in cases like dependencies injection cleanup after their usage in a test instance.\n\nMost of the test methods don’t have parameters. We use the ParameterResolver interface when using parameters, which defines the API org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ParameterResolver for extensions. It provides the functionality to resolve parameters at runtime dynamically.\n\nThe following constructors and annotated methods of a test class can then have one or more parameters:\n\nThe parameter resolution can be made through name, type, annotation, or a combination of the same. JUnit 5 implements dependency injection using parameters for constructors and methods of test classes to make this possible.\n\nThese parameters must be resolved at runtime by an instance of the ParameterResolver type that needs to be registered previously.\n\nBy default, JUnit 5 automatically registers ParameterResolver using the three-built-in resolvers:\n• TestInfoParameterResolver: Used to resolve, inject an instance of type TestInfo, and obtain information about the test whose execution is in progress.\n• RepetitionInfoParameterResolver: Used to inject an instance of type RepetitionInfo only for repeated tests.\n• TestReporterParameterResolver: Used to inject an instance of type TestReporter by allowing it to add useful information to the test report.\n\nIn case you are using JUnit 4, you can check out our detailed blog that deep dives into Parameterization in JUnit for Selenium Automation.\n\nThe TestExecutionExceptionHandler interface defines the API that implements extensions that let you fully customize the behavior of a test case when an exception is thrown.\n\nIn continuation to the earlier JUnit 5 extension example, we have used the ArithmeticException on the divide test case to create a test class as shown below:\n\nIt is extended to an exception handler class for handling the exception that is thrown by the divide operation (when handling with the division by zero):\n\nIt is possible to use the traditional method of throwing an exception (using try…catch, Rules, etc.) or through annotations by implementing the TestExecutionExceptionHandler interface.\n\nThe principle behind JUnit is to provide an easily extensible basic framework that allows users to act faster than API developers. This feature makes it possible to build APIs that serve as a basis for third-party libraries.\n\nThough JUnit 5 has a number of third-party extensions, we will cover the following extensions as they are widely used by the developer community:\n\nJUnit 5 is best suited for running unit tests. However, when performing integration testing between modules (or interdependent resources) and interaction verification, stubs or mocks are used to simulate (or represent) the dependent or unavailable resources. Mockito is a framework that allows the creation of mock objects for integration testing.\n\nHere are the major ways in which you can use MockitoExtension:\n• Using JUnit 5 extensions that are available in the mockito-junit-jupiter artifact (Most preferred option)\n\nThe use of the Mockito extension can be seen by applying the extension by adding @ExtendWith to the test class and annotating the simulated fields with @Mock.\n\nFor example, if we need to test the class SERVICE and mock the database, we need to use the following code:\n\nThe test class then will look like this:\n\nBy combining the strength of Selenium, the most popular web browser testing framework, and the power of JUnit 5, selenium-jupiter allows creating Selenium tests using local and/or remote browsers. With this, you can run different types of tests for verifying the functionality of web and mobile applications. In addition, the selenium-jupiter extension can be used for Selenium automation testing.\n\nThe following dependency should be used for Maven Projects:\n\nSelenium-Jupiter can be used by simply using the @ExtendWith annotation on the SeleniumJupiter interface for performing cross browser compatibility testing. Here is a sample demonstration:\n\nRead – Automated Testing With JUnit And Selenium For Browser Compatibility\n\nHow to use Selenium-Jupiter for Selenium Automation Testing\n\nSelenium-Jupiter supports testing remote web browsers on a Selenium Grid through the combination of DriverCapabilities & RemoteWebDriver. You can also perform parallel testing in Selenium by running tests on different browser & platform combinations using LambdaTest.\n\nHow to use Selenium-Jupiter for Mobile Device Testing\n\nTo create an instance of ApiumDriver to drive mobile devices, the annotation DriverCapabilities. Selenium-Jupiter will automatically start an instance of the Appium server.\n\nHow to use Selenium-Jupiter to perform Selenium Automation testing on Cloud Grid\n\nSelenium-Jupiter lets you run Selenium automation tests on a cloud-based cross browser testing platform like LambdaTest. The major benefits of cloud testing are improved browser coverage, elimination of environment-related schedule delays, improved product quality, and reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). Check out our cloud testing tutorial covering the innumerable benefits of migrating tests to a cloud Selenium Grid like LambdaTest.\n\nAfter you create an account on LamdaTest, note the username & access from the LambdaTest profile section. These credentials are required for accessing the cloud grid. Then, you can generate the desired capabilities using the LambdaTest Capabilities Generator.\n\nShown below is an example of running JUnit 5 test on the LambdaTest Grid:\n\nHere is the execution snapshot that indicates that the test execution was successful.\n\nIntroduced in Spring 5, Spring TestContext is a Spring framework that offers full integration with the JUnit 5 Jupiter programming model. It can be found in the org.springframework.test.context.junit.jupiter.SpringExtension package.\n\nIt can be used by simply annotating the JUnit Jupiter test class with any one of the following annotations:\n\nShown below is a JUnit 5 Extension Example that demonstrates the usage of Spring TestContext:\n\nThe JUnit 5 extension model built into Jupiter has solved inherent problems in JUnit 4 extension points. The model implements multiple built-in extension points and allows their customization and grouped use. This allows extension developers to implement interfaces in one of the existing ones to incorporate extra capabilities for JUnit 5.\n\nJUnit 5 extensions allow enhancing and extending JUnit capabilities. However, some frameworks also have fully integrated and adapted JUnit extension points allowing their reuse, making the Jupiter extension model more powerful, and simplifying tests according to the environments and situations. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to use the extension points, whether integrated or customized, to make the tests more reliable.\n\nThis article does not exhaustively present all the extension points integrated with JUnit 5 or even all the extensions of third-party libraries. Therefore, if you are interested in an extension point or a third-party extension framework that is not shown here, you can let us know to complete this guide according to the readers’ interests.\n\nWe can also develop a little more in detail those which do not seem clear to you in this guide. We are also interested in your feedback on using JUnit Jupiter extension points in your respective projects. The source code of the above examples can be found on GitHub."

        "document": "To integrate JUnit 5 into your Java project, you need to add the appropriate dependencies to your build file. JUnit 5 is available on Maven Central, so you can easily add it to your Maven or Gradle project.\n\nTo write a JUnit 5 test, you need to create a test class and add test methods to it. Test classes are annotated with @Test and test methods are annotated with @Test as well. Here is an example of a simple JUnit 5 test:\n\nIn this example, we have created a test class called MyTest with a single test method called test(). The assertEquals() method is used to check that the expected value (2) is equal to the actual value (1 + 1).\n\nParameterized tests allow you to run the same test with different inputs. This is useful for testing methods that take different inputs and produce different outputs. In JUnit 5, you can use the @ParameterizedTest annotation to create parameterized tests. Here is an example:\n\nIn this example, we have used the assertEquals() method to check that the expected value (7) is equal to the actual value (3 + 4). We have also used the assertTrue() method to check that the string str starts with the letter \"J\", and the assertArrayEquals() method to check that the expected array is equal to the actual array.\n\nJUnit 5 provides several lifecycle callbacks that allow you to perform setup and teardown operations before and after each test method. These callbacks are annotated with @BeforeEach, @AfterEach , @BeforeAll, and @AfterAll. Here is an example:\n\nIn this example, we have used the @BeforeAll and @AfterAll annotations to perform setup and teardown operations before and after all tests. We have also used the @BeforeEach and @AfterEach annotations to perform setup and teardown operations before and after each test method. The output of running this test class would be:\n\nJUnit 5 allows you to group tests using test suites and tag them based on categories. Test suites are created using the @Suite annotation and tags are created using the @Tag annotation. Here is an example:\n\nIn this example, we have created a test suite called MyTestSuite that includes two test classes ( MyTest1 and MyTest2). We have also tagged the test suite with the @Tag(\"fast\") annotation to indicate that these tests are fast.\n\nDynamic tests allow you to create tests dynamically at runtime. This is useful for testing scenarios where the number of tests is not known in advance. In JUnit 5, you can use the @TestFactory annotation to create dynamic tests. Here is an example:\n\nJUnit 5 extensions are reusable components that can be added to your test classes to provide additional functionality. Extensions can be used to add new annotations, modify the behavior of existing annotations, or provide additional functionality to your tests. Some popular JUnit 5 extensions include Mockito, JUnitParams, and JUnit5-extensions-junit-jupiter-params.\n\nTo use an extension, you need to add it to your test class using the @ExtendWith annotation. Here is an example of using the Mockito extension to create a mock object:\n\nIn this example, we have added the Mockito extension to our test class using the @ExtendWith annotation. We have also used the @Mock and @InjectMocks annotations to create a mock object and inject it into our test class. You can also create your own custom extensions by implementing the org.junit.jupiter.engine.extension.Extension interface. Custom extensions can be used to add new functionality to your tests or modify the behavior of existing annotations."
