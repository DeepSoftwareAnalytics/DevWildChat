        "document": "Crash reports are a very important part of troubleshooting issues with your game or server. They contain a lot of information about the crash, and can help you find the cause of the crash.\n\nCrash reports are stored in the folder in your game directory. If you are using a server, they are stored in the folder in the server directory.\n\nFor third party launchers, you should refer to their documentation on where to find crash reports.\n\nCrash reports can be found in the following locations:\n\nCrash reports are very long, and can be very confusing to read. However, they contain a lot of information about the crash, and can help you find the cause of the crash.\n\nFor this guide, we will be using this crash report.\n\n// There are four lights! are in unnamed module of loader are in unnamed module of loader A detailed walkthrough of the error, its code path and all known details is as follows: Is Modded: Definitely; Client brand changed to\n\nCrash reports consist of several sections, each separated using a header:\n• , the summary of the report. This section will contain the main error that caused the crash, the time it occurred, and the relevant stack trace. This is the most important section of the crash report as the stack trace can usually contain references to the mod that caused the crash.\n• , this section isn't really useful unless the crash occurred during a resource reload ( ). This section will contain the time of the last reload, and the relevant stack trace of any errors that occurred during the reload process. These errors are usually caused by resource packs, and can be ignored unless they are causing issues with the game.\n• , this section contains information about your system, such as the operating system, Java version, and the amount of memory allocated to the game. This section is useful for determining if you are using the correct version of Java, and if you have allocated enough memory to the game.\n• In this section, Fabric will have included a custom line that says , followed by a list of all the mods you have installed. This section is useful for determining if any conflicts could have occurred between mods.\n\nNow that we know what each section of the crash report is, we can start to break down the crash report and find the cause of the crash.\n\nUsing the example linked above, we can analyze the crash report and find the cause of the crash, including the mods that caused the crash.\n\nThe stack trace in the section is the most important in this case, as it contains the main error that caused the crash. In this case, the error is java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke \"net.minecraft.class_2248.method_9539()\" because \"net.minecraft.class_2248.field_10540\" is null .\n\nWith the amount of mods mentioned in the stack trace, it can be difficult to point fingers, but the first thing to do is to look for the mod that caused the crash.\n\n// There are four lights! are in unnamed module of loader are in unnamed module of loader A detailed walkthrough of the error, its code path and all known details is as follows: Is Modded: Definitely; Client brand changed to\n\nIn this case, the mod that caused the crash is , as it is the first mod mentioned in the stack trace.\n\nHowever, with the amount of mods mentioned, it could mean there are some compatibility issues between the mods, and the mod that caused the crash may not be the mod that is at fault. In this case, it is best to report the crash to the mod author, and let them investigate the crash.\n\nWhen a mixin crashes, it will usually mention the mixin in the stack trace, and the class that the mixin is modifying.\n\nMethod mixins will contain in the stack trace, where is the mod's ID, and is the name of the mixin handler.\n\nYou can use this information to find the mod that caused the crash, and report the crash to the mod author.\n\nWhat to Do with Crash Reports ​\n\nThe best thing to do with crash reports is to upload them to a paste site, and then share the link with the mod author, either on their issue trackers or through some form of communication (Discord etc.).\n\nThis will allow the mod author to investigate the crash, potentially reproduce it, and solve the problem that caused it.\n\nCommon paste sites that are used frequently for crash reports are:"
