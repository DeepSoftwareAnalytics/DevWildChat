        "document": "I've not used DSP blocks for TI MCUs so far but you can fix this problem by changing the solver of your model. go to Simulation > Model Configuration....> Solver then change the \"Solver options\" to \"Fixed-step\" and \"Solver\" to \"discrete (no continuous state)\".\n\nThen in your model, the sample time for each block must be a discrete value or \"-1\".\n\nIf my post answered your question, please click on \"Verified answer\" button."
