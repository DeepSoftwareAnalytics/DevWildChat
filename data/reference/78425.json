However, unifying incompatible architectures poses significant challenges. Therefore, following best practice is paramount to ensure a seamless and successful integration process that meets the evolving needs of modern enterprises.\n\nThe primary goal of any integration is to break down data and workflow silos by seamlessly connecting custom and existing software. When done well, this unlocks efficiency gains, unified analytics, and superior customer experiences.\n\nHowever, hurdles around compatibility, change management, complexity, and compliance often arise from poor planning and execution. This guide explores proven approaches across analysis, design, security, testing, and deployment to enable smooth integration between custom-built and current software solutions.\n\nThe following best practice insights, compiled by our team of experts at Idea Maker, will equip you as IT leaders to realize long-term value from custom software investments. By taking an informed strategic approach, your organization can pave the way for a seamless custom software integration.\n\nCustom software integration refers to the process of connecting software applications specifically built to meet your organization’s needs with your existing systems, for example Enterprise Resource Planning systems (ERPs), Custom Relationship Management systems (CRMs) and databases. Unlike off-the-shelf software, which offers limited flexibility, custom systems are tailored to fit the unique workflows and requirements of your company.\n\nIntegrating such bespoke solutions enables you to extend your capabilities and automate processes across departments. These integrated systems can seamlessly share data and interoperate without requiring complex manual interventions. The aim is to provide your users with a unified interface instead of disparate systems, thereby enhancing productivity and decision-making processes.\n\nAs a business, you must invest significant resources in custom software integrations to maximize your return on investment (ROI) of software development by enhancing adoption across the organization. When executed correctly, integration unlocks opportunities for growth through new capabilities, deeper insights from unified data, and increased operational efficiency.\n\nHowever, custom integrations also present engineering challenges due to the specialized nature of custom systems and the need to account for legacy architectures. By following these system integration best practices, and with expert guidance, your organizations can ensure that their integration initiatives deliver maximum value.\n\nBest Practices For Integrating Custom Software With Existing Systems\n\nIntegrating new and old systems requires meticulous planning and skilled execution. The following guidelines can help your organization seamlessly integrate custom software with your existing systems.\n\nBefore diving into the complexities of custom software integration, it is essential to conduct a thorough needs analysis. This critical phase lays the groundwork for your entire integration process.\n\nFirstly, understand your requirements. Your IT teams should begin by clearly defining your goals and objectives for integration. This involves identifying problem areas within your current workflows and understanding how your new software will address these issues. It is also important to specify which systems require integration to ensure a targeted approach. Utilizing user research can greatly assist in accurately capturing these needs and objectives.\n\nYou should also assess your current infrastructure. Having a deep understanding of your existing architectures and system capabilities is essential before designing an integration strategy. This assessment should cover various aspects, including technical limitations, security protocols, proprietary APIs, and dependency issues.\n\nBy thoroughly analyzing your existing infrastructure constraints, you can tailor integration solutions to seamlessly align with your organization’s needs and objectives.\n\nOnce you have gained a clear understanding of the requirements and existing systems, it’s time to design a detailed integration plan. This phase is crucial for outlining how your new system will seamlessly sync, exchange data, and operate with other applications. Mapping out your integration involves defining the specifics of these interactions, then determining the sequence of actions across all systems based on various use cases and data flows.\n\nSelecting the appropriate integration method is important. There are several techniques available, such as API-based, messaging-based, or database-level integration, as well as the utilization of middleware tools. Your choice of software integration strategy should align with factors such as the specific use case, desired flexibility, complexity of interactions, and existing APIs.\n\nChoose the Right Tools and Technologies for Integration\n\nWhen choosing the right tools and technologies for integration, several key factors should be considered to ensure a seamless integration between new and legacy applications:\n• Integration Capabilities: The selected integration tool should possess the necessary pre-built connectors, APIs, messaging, and data transformation features to facilitate the mapped integrations. It should also support various integration methods such as API, web services, or database integrations as required.\n• Security: It’s crucial that the tool selected supports standard protocols like SSL/TLS to ensure secure communications between applications. Additionally, robust access controls, encryption, and other security measures should be in place to safeguard sensitive data.\n• Scalability: Your chosen tool should be capable of handling large volumes of data and requests from integrated systems without experiencing performance issues. Ideally, it should offer scalability in terms of bandwidth and throughput to accommodate future growth.\n• Compatibility: The integration tool vendor should have experience with the applications being connected and can confirm that the tool is appropriate for your specific integration. It’s essential that the tool offers connectors, APIs, and support for both modern and legacy systems to ensure seamless integration.\n• Ease of Use: You should choose tools with intuitive interfaces and workflows that empower users to manage integrations without heavy reliance on developers. This not only reduces maintenance overhead but also saves time and cuts costs.\n• Monitoring and Analytics: You will need to identify tools that provide real-time integration monitoring dashboards and logs to track the integration process and overall performance. This feature is invaluable for detecting issues early and proactively addressing them.\n• Error Handling: Capabilities for handling errors such as network failures or missing responses without disrupting initialized processes are essential for smooth integration.\n\nIn summation, selecting the right tools and technologies with these considerations in mind forms the foundation of a successful integration of custom software with existing systems. These factors play a pivotal role in ensuring that your integration process is efficient, secure, and scalable, leading to a seamless and optimized operational environment.\n\nPrioritizing security and compliance is important when integrating custom software with your existing systems. This entails implementing robust security measures to mitigate potential risks introduced by additional data flows and system access required for integration. By restricting access to what is necessary, encrypting data transfers, implementing strong authentication mechanisms, and adhering to other security best practices tailored to your infrastructure, you can safeguard sensitive information effectively.\n\nAdditionally, ensuring compliance with regulations concerning data protection, privacy, and industry standards relevant to the systems being integrated is essential. Non-compliance with these regulations can result in legal and financial consequences for your organization. It is therefore essential to ensure you are up-to-date with the latest regulations and proactively ensure your integration meets these standards.\n\nWhen integrating custom software, it’s crucial that you plan for the future, looking forward 3-5 years as well as addressing your immediate integration needs. As your business grows in terms of users, transactions, and data, your integration solution should have the flexibility built in to scale up accordingly without major rework.\n\nYour integration architecture and tools should have sufficient capacity to handle higher data volumes, request rates and any new API connections to emerging applications/services without performance lags or disruption.\n\nGoogle advises incorporating documented integration patterns into your integration strategy to deploy scalable and resilient software. These patterns encompass modular integration, leveraging cloud-based integration platforms, containerization through Docker/Kubernetes, and employing APIs and loose coupling between integrated systems.\n\nYou should thoroughly test your integration identifying bugs, gaps, and risks before proceeding with full rollout. You can do this by employing a range of testing strategies from the list below:\n• Unit Testing: Validate individual components and functions as expected. This helps you catch early issues and detect bottlenecks.\n• Integration Testing: Verify seamless workings between newly integrated applications. It’s useful to mimic real-world user cases.\n• User Testing: Conduct controlled testing across groups of end-users to validate usability, workflows, and to identify unanticipated gaps in your integration. User testing can also gather invaluable user feedback.\n• Performance Testing: Validate your ability to handle expected data volumes and request rates after integration. This process is crucial to determine system performance during peak demand and under stressful conditions.\n• Security Testing: Identify vulnerabilities that may be introduced post-integration.\n• Regression Testing: Check for problems caused by changes and new integrations through iterated testing.\n\nFixing problems identified during testing is significantly cheaper and easier than waiting to remediate post-rollout. You should allocate sufficient time for testing to minimize the chances of problems post-rollout.\n\nDeploying your new software solution demands a strategic approach to ensure integration with your existing software is seamless. One of the most effective methods is a phased deployment. With this strategy, your custom software is initially rolled out to a small group of users or user groups to monitor adoption and performance aiming to address any potential issues before a wider implementation.\n\nImplementing real-time monitoring and logging tools before full deployment is crucial for maintaining system health and security. These tools provide insights into performance metrics, enabling quick response to any arising issues.\n\nIntegrating custom software can have a significant impact on established workflows, potentially disrupting end users and service delivery. To mitigate these challenges and ensure a smooth transition, you must include a change management plan in your deployment strategy.\n\nCommunication is key throughout the integration process. You must inform all stakeholders early enough about how the integration will affect operations and workflows. By clearly explaining the benefits of the integration, your dedicated development team secures buy-in from your stakeholders and encourages them to provide valuable feedback, which can inform adjustments to the implementation plan.\n\nOngoing maintenance of your custom software is just as important as the initial integration. Proper maintenance ensures that your new software continues to meet your company’s evolving needs and meets stakeholder expectations. It is therefore essential that you allocate resources for tasks such as minor bug fixes, implementing new features, future upgrades, and responding to user change requests.\n\nAside from proactive maintenance, having technical experts on standby to provide hands-on support is crucial, especially during the early stages of your custom software integration. These experts can prove invaluable in troubleshooting integration issues as they arise, ensuring timely resolutions and minimizing potential disruptions to your business.\n\nEvery successful custom software integration requires comprehensive documentation and user training to ensure effective adoption and management of the integrated system. You must provide up-to-date documentation of architecture diagrams, API specifications, operating procedures, and troubleshooting guides, among essential resources for the integration solution.\n\nThe effectiveness of an integrated custom software solution hinges on how well users can learn to utilize it. Therefore, your company should invest in training your users to ensure proficiency in using and managing the integrated system effectively. Proper training not only enhances your users’ understanding of the system but also drives successful adoption, maximizing the benefits of integration.\n\nThough internal IT teams are capable of handling certain aspects of your custom software integration process, the expertise of specialized integration consultants and tool vendors such as Idea Maker is often indispensable for achieving optimal results. When selecting integration partners, you must evaluate potential partners based on the following:\n• Expertise with the applications being connected\n\nPartnering with experienced integration experts not only helps mitigate potential risks but also expedites the realization of ROI.

        "document": "Following system integration best practices it is possible for organisations to improve efficiency, increase performance and reduce costs. In this article we discuss data integration best practices for enterprise architects including challenges, methods and planning. Download the free digital transformation roadmap as a starting point when planning your integration project.\n\nSystem integration is the process of integrating a wide range of business systems, databases and applications together so that data can be pushed and pulled between them.\n\nSystem integration needs to be able to cater for a wide range of scenarios as business will usually rely on and want to use multiple systems and applications.\n\nThese can include large legacy systems, third-party applications, enterprise applications, B2B environments, web services, micro apps and electronic data interchange solutions – whether on-premises or cloud-based.\n\nOnce all these are connected, organisations can then automate numerous data exchanges, workflows, notifications and reporting procedures.\n\nWhen do you need system integration?\n\nImproving business performance is the fundamental reason that many businesses implement system integration.\n\nThere are many driving factors for this. It could be that the organisation needs to reduce costs due to the economic environment. Alternatively, it could be driven by large growth and success.\n\nThe one thing that both scenarios have in common though, is the reliance on data.\n\nAccording to Gartner, data has become one of the most valuable commodities available to organisations and increasing access to good quality information enables them to improve operational efficiencies, gain greater insight into performance, and ultimately improve decision making.\n\nThe issue that many face though is the lack of synchronisation between systems, which leads to the inconsistency of this data.\n\nOrganisations are regularly adopting new and different applications to manage day-to-day operations, whether this is for sales, accounting and marketing or development, production and distribution.\n\nThe breadth and scale of applications now available is quite mind-boggling; there seems to be an app for everything, and they are being widely adopted.\n\nWhilst all these applications do make processing data for that particular role or department much easier, the applications often become isolated. This subsequently means that the data is also isolated, which can have serious implications for an organisation, as it can make it much harder for a company to gain insight into performance, business trends or opportunities.\n\nThese information silos therefore need to be synchronised to help improve business efficiency and streamline operational processes. As a result, all applications and systems within a business need to be integrated. Download the workbook below to help you establish in-house systems, data processes and day-to-day operations that require business process automation.\n\nSome organisations may not necessarily be early adopters of lots of new applications, relying solely on legacy systems to run the business. However, the same analogy applies. And to be honest, it won’t be long before they will be adopting new technology. They will have to in order to stay competitive and to service the needs of their customers, partners or suppliers.\n\nThe beauty of system integration though is that it will help prolong the life of these legacy systems, many of which will have received significant investment over the years and likely hold a wealth of data.\n\nImplementing system integration will enable organisations to add to their existing IT environment without ripping everything out. This is even more significant if an organisation acquires another business.\n\nQuite often each organisation will have its own dedicated infrastructure. For example, one organisation could be using an ERP system like Microsoft Dynamics, but the company that has acquired it is using SAP Business One. Without system integration, this could create significant operational issues.\n\nIn a similar vein, having a system integration plan in place will also be much easier to incorporate and link up with partner systems if required.\n\nThis is especially relevant for many B2B businesses, especially within the manufacturing and wholesale industries, that need to exchange business critical documents and messages.\n\nEven smaller businesses are now trading with the likes of Amazon, B&Q, Wayfair etc., and will therefore require some form of EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) integration.\n\nSystem integration therefore makes organisations much more agile, with the ability to quickly adapt to new scenarios or opportunities.\n• Adding a new application to the business\n\nGoing back to increasing efficiency, improving performance and cutting costs, organisations need to look at automating business processes, and this can only be achieved by integrating systems.\n\nManual data entry not only consumes valuable resources, it can also lead to inconsistent data and be susceptible to errors. Automating this type of activity will alleviate this issue and improve the synchronisation of data, leading to greater insight and analysis of information and the potential to pursue new opportunities.\n\nImage: System integration enables organisations to integrate a wide range of business systems, databases and applications together\n\nWhat is the biggest challenge in system integration?\n\nSystem integration can either be very straightforward or extremely complicated. It really depends on the size of the company, the existing IT environment and the integration required. The common challenges of system integration may include:\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for a lot of older companies is that they are more than likely running operations using old monolithic, legacy systems. These have usually expanded over time, with different modules for specific tasks built in and interwoven into the fabric of the software. Often containing a huge amount of data (we’ll discuss data integration challenges later) organisations are, obviously, reluctant to replace them.\n\nThe complexity of these systems can often make them difficult to integrate with, especially if they are using old language formats or have been heavily customised.\n\nIn fact, it’s not that uncommon for businesses to have built a completely bespoke business system to manage day-to-day activities. This makes it even more challenging, especially if the developer is no longer working for the company.\n\nAnother challenge is the number of systems, applications and tools that are being used in the organisation. Again, these can widely differ on the type of connections required to integrate.\n\nSome may even have existing integration connectors that need to be ripped out and replaced, adding further complications to an integration project.\n\nWhereas system integration used to be fairly straightforward being contained on-premises within the enterprise, the widespread adoption of cloud-based applications and services has added another challenge to the mix.\n\nAny integration projects therefore need to be able to cater for hybrid integration scenarios, with the ability to connect on-premises business systems with cloud applications.\n\nIn fact, the rapidly changing environment of cloud-based software means that system integration solutions need to be flexible enough to accommodate a wide range of applications and services. The long-term scalability of any system integration solution needs to be considered, as well as future project scenarios.\n\nThis is where some cheap, quick fix plug-ins fail. Although they can integrate certain applications quite quickly together, they are fairly limited in their scope and flexibility and often fall short of providing a more comprehensive service, usually only providing a basic connection.\n\nThey don’t usually have the capacity to transform data, access other data repositories or perform lookups. They tend to be quite rigid. Additionally, if anything breaks it can cause significant issues.\n\nIronically, many expensive, renowned solutions also suffer from this inflexibility, simply providing a fixed connection and lacking the customisation capabilities that many organisations require.\n\nIn rapidly changing environments, organisations need total control over design in order to adapt to business change, different requirements or new opportunities. The ability to modify an existing integration is therefore essential.\n\nAnother challenge that arises is the use of different messaging protocols and programming languages. As we have discussed, organisations usually have multiple systems, applications and web services that need to be connected. Each will utilise a particular integration method, whether this is via an API (SOAP or REST), EDI (electronic data interchange) or web hook.\n\nSecurity is another factor that needs to be considered, especially in regard to the management of data and the concerns regarding data breaches.\n\nAn integration solution ideally needs to adhere to the best practices of the software vendor that it is connecting to, and ideally have some form of accreditation. It should also provide advanced authentication protocols, such as OpenID Connect, Azure Active Directory and OAuth2, to provide secure access for all users.\n\nThe whole point of system integration is to improve the management and synchronisation of data.\n\nData does, however, bring its own challenges, as you can imagine.\n\nThe quality of data is essential for any successful integration project. As we have discussed, organisations are using a multitude of different applications and systems which means that there are multiple data repositories. Collating all of this data suddenly becomes a massive undertaking.\n\nAdditionally, if an organisation hasn’t implemented a data integration plan before, a lot of these data repositories could contain duplicate information, or even the wrong information. Data will therefore need to be cleansed before it can become useful.\n\nSometimes the data may not even be located where it should be, causing further delays to integration. It could be saved in a spreadsheet on an employee’s desktop, hidden away in some dark corner of the database, or a multitude of different reasons.\n\nApplications and systems can also generate different data formats which may not necessarily be compatible with each other. Some systems may write formats as XML, whereas the target system may require the format as a CSV (Command Separated Value) or JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) to read the data.\n\nThe data will therefore need to be converted into an understandable format for the receiving system or application to process. This is another tricky and time-consuming activity that not all integration solutions can manage.\n\nWhen organisations are looking to integrate systems they also need to consider how the data is processed. Some solutions only process data one way. However, for data integration to have real impact they really need to consider bi-directional data flows. Download the brochure below to discover over 200 ways your organisation can benefit from business process automation.\n\nIn light of all the above, one of the biggest challenges to system integration is ensuring that the planning is watertight.\n\nIneffectual planning is one the biggest downfalls in system integration projects. Far too many integration projects fail to deliver or don’t return an expected outcome due to a lack of research and forward planning.\n\nWithout proper planning and a quantifiable approach to system integration it could quite quickly unravel. A great deal needs to be considered before embarking on an integration project.\n• What are you trying to achieve?\n• What is the purpose of the integration?\n• Which systems are essential to integrate?\n• What data needs to be processed and managed?\n\nEveryone, or at least each department, within the organisation needs to have some sort of input into the planning process to ensure that the project delivers what is actually needed.\n\nIn line with this, there also needs to be a level of accountability so that the project can run smoothly, whether this is the project manager or the actual systems integrator.\n\nOne issue that really does make system integration challenging is when an organisation requires the integration process to be immediate. Time constraints on projects can obviously be a massive challenge for integration projects – especially as it can reduce the planning time as discussed above.\n\nAn integration solution therefore needs to be extremely flexible, with the ability to quickly adapt to a changing environment and the demands of the project. Use the downloadable project management workbook below to help you detail your system integration requirements.\n\nAs you may have gathered from reading this article, the method that you choose for system and data integration has a significant impact on performance, speed, security and flexibility.\n\nPrior to the release of APIs, manual integration was the only real option. Developers would have to write bespoke code to connect two different systems or data sources together. They would then need to collect and cleanse the data and then convert it into the relevant format in order to upload it into the specified application or system.\n\nThis is an extremely time-consuming process, which takes up a lot of resource, and is prone to errors. Once written and applied it is extremely difficult to adapt or customise, which, as we have mentioned before, can be further compounded if the person who has written the code has stopped working for the company.\n\nIt is a very rigid and locked method of connecting data sources, and is only really recommended for handling a small amount of data that does not need constantly changing.\n\nThe development of APIs, however, has made the integration process a lot simpler. Although still requiring developers to connect the systems, application integration, also known as point-to-point integration, uses a set of common API protocols to connect and transfer data automatically.\n\nThe APIs can be connected to each other by either in-house development or by using a simple plug-in. Whilst this is a vast improvement on manual integration, it still has its limitations.\n\nAgain, the integration tends to be quite rigid and doesn’t always provide the flexibility that many organisations require, such as the ability to customise the connection or data flows without significant disruption.\n\nScalability is therefore restricted with this method and constantly requires dedicated technical management onsite to ensure that it runs smoothly at all times.\n\nThe integration is also singular, simply deployed for one particular connection, making it only a small component of an often-required wider integration strategy.\n\nMiddleware integration tools, on the other hand, is a much more flexible option for system and data integration. As the name suggests, middleware sits in the middle of an IT environment connecting all the various systems, databases and web services that an organisation uses, whether on-premises or in the cloud.\n\nModern middleware solutions also provide a much more intuitive way of connecting systems and adjusting workflows by using a visual, graphical user interface, with minimal reliance on coding. Data flows, as well as being automated, are easily adapted and reconfigured using drag and drop technology.\n\nA competent middleware solution can also handle a multitude of data formats, with the ability to convert data from one source into a format that the receiving system can read. This makes it especially useful for connecting legacy systems with newer applications and services.\n\nAlthough middleware may have a greater initial outlay, the ROI can often be quite instantaneous. It also provides a much more flexible and scalable option for future projects.\n\nElectronic data interchange (EDI) is another common integration approach that is widely used by many organisations, especially B2B businesses that need to share business information and documents in an electronic format, such as manufacturers, retailers, suppliers, carriers and 3PLs.\n\nEDI is achieved by either a direct connection between the two businesses, or via a VAN (value-added network) maintained by a third-party.\n\nEDI technology uses various protocols, including FTP/ SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol), HTTP/HTTPS-based protocols, mModem (asynchronous and synchronous), AS1/2/4 (Applicability Statement), SOAP etc., to exchange purchase orders, invoices, dispatch and delivery notes, debit and credit notes etc., in a standard format.\n\nDespite the ability to connect directly, many organisations are actually now using a middleware solution to integrate other business applications with EDI systems, as well as to increase business process automation capability.\n\nHow do you implement system integration?\n\nSo what are system integration best practices? Well, the first action to undertake is to assemble a project management team.\n\nEvery organisation will have a different approach, depending on the size, structure and the knowledge of the employees responsible for the integration project.\n\nSome organisations may have a dedicated IT department or person that is fully capable of managing the entire process. Others may rely on an IT partner or systems integrator to implement and guide them through the project.\n\nWhichever scenario is applicable, the project management team will then need to embark on a 5-step plan of action, including:\n\nAs we discussed earlier in the article, system integration planning is extremely important, and could determine its success or failure.\n\nFrom the outset, everyone needs to know the objectives of the project – what is trying to be achieved and the ultimate goal for system integration. This needs to tie in with an overall business automation strategy that will help improve efficiencies, increase performance and ultimately enable growth.\n\nAt this stage, it is advisable to get input from each and every employee or department that will be relying on the integration and subsequent data management to ensure that the right information is going to be available.\n• What are the business cases – what needs resolving?\n• What data needs to be accessed and managed?\n• What processes need to be automated?\n• What are the priority objectives?\n• What are the future requirements?\n\nThe objectives will usually determine the type of integration that is required and the level of investment to be expected. It will also assist with prioritising the stages of the project. Use the downloadable project management workbook below to help you determine your system integration plan.\n\nOnce the objectives have been agreed, the project management team then need to carry out a detailed analysis of the existing infrastructure – the systems, applications and processes already in place and where the data is located. This will help determine what integration method is required and what processes need to be automated.\n• What systems need to be integrated?\n• Are there existing integrations that need replacing?\n• Which processes are going to be automated?\n• How much data needs to be processed?\n• What business rules are in place?\n\nOnce these questions have been assessed the systems integrator, IT partner or internal developer will be able to provide a detailed recommendation of what is achievable, in a particular timeframe, and an estimated cost.\n\nWith the objectives agreed and a detailed analysis performed, the project management team can then select the right integration solution(s) to progress with the project.\n\nThis will provide the platform for the team to start designing the architecture and mapping the business processes.\n\nA good way of achieving this is by documenting the desired business processes into BPMN (business process model and notation) process flow diagrams. These flow charts provide a visual representation of the actual processes that technical or non-technical people can understand.\n\nThese process flow charts can help map out administrative processes such as:\n\nThe process flow charts will also enable the team to ensure business rules are followed and help identify any potential issues or bottlenecks that might arise.\n\nImage: Process flow diagrams can help map out the integration required and the processes that need automating\n\nOnce the integration and processes are mapped out, the systems integrator or IT partner can then start building the connections and business process automation tasks.\n\nThe type of system integration selected will ultimately determine the length of time that this will take to complete. In many instances, manual integration will potentially take months due to the bespoke coding required. Using a middleware solution, however, can reduce this time to just a few weeks.\n\nOnce the connections and tasks are in place the system will need to be vigorously tested before going live to ensure a smooth transition to automated processing.\n\nOne of the benefits of using a dedicated middleware solution over bespoke manual integration is the flexibility and scalability that is offered. New applications, web services or even new central business systems can easily be incorporated into an IT environment.\n\nData workflows can also be managed from one central location and easily adapted to react to any business changes.\n\nUpgrades will also be applied without affecting any system connections or causing any interruptions to data flows. This would be relatively impossible with manual integration.\n\nSupport and training should also be available, enabling IT employees to manage the business processes internally.\n\nSystem integration and applying automation to numerous business processes, enables organisations to easily improve business efficiency, reduce costs and increase the visibility of critical information. Following the system integration best practices outlined above will ensure the smooth deployemnt of any integration project and help to achieve agreed business objectives.\n\nFor more information on the benefits of system integration and how it can help your business, download the brochure below or call us on +44(0) 330 99 88 700."

        "document": "Using various IT components for distinct tasks is a prevalent approach. However, as business operations grow, organizations may find themselves overwhelmed by tons of disjointed software incapable of exchanging data and collaborating. This is where the system integration steps into consideration.\n\nTo help organizations meld separate pieces of software effectively, this article covers everything about software integration, including components, benefits, and best practices.\n\nIntegration refers to the process of connecting multiple software into one cohesive infrastructure, with the purpose of streamlining business processes and making them more efficient.\n\nDisjointed software solutions often result in data being overlooked and insights failing to be shared among teams. Thus, the common use of software integration services is for businesses to create seamless communication between multiple platforms, such as a banking app connected to ATM systems for cardless withdrawal. In this case, engaging a software development team to help out with the necessary architecture is worth considering.\n\nSoftware integration can be categorized in different ways; one of the common methods to achieve connectivity between separate systems is through “connectors”:\n• Application programming interfaces (APIs) are among the more frequently deployed system integration technologies. They offer a direct method of connecting two systems, enabling the transmission of data and functionality in a standardized manner.\n• Integration services components (ISCs) utilize a server to connect various systems with their localized management tools. This method of systems integration is suitable for companies seeking access to their complete dataset without importing large files.\n• Webhooks, also known as HTTP callbacks, are real-time messages sent from one system to another upon the occurrence of specific events.\n• Orchestration is the most automated system integration methodology, managing complex scheduling duties across various subsystems, significantly enhancing operational efficiency, and simplifying data flows.\n\nMany corporations rely on outdated software to execute essential business operations, which cannot simply be replaced due to its vital role in daily workflow. Instead, legacy systems can be modernized by using APIs, webhooks, and shared connection components to synchronize existing investments with new tools.\n\nExample: Connecting a legacy CRM system to an online banking system.\n\nSome categories of enterprise application integration include vertical or horizontal integration and point-to-point integration. The objective here is to provide multiple functions from separate apps in a singular environment.\n\nExample: creating one ecosystem of banking platforms, including Mobile Banking Systems, Fraud Detection Systems, ATM Connections, and Loan Organization Systems.\n\nGoal: broadening the functionality of the existing software.\n\nThis is an ideal option for organizations aiming to upgrade their software’s functionality without investing in an entirely new platform.\n\nExample: integrating an existing banking application with online payment systems (PayPal, WebMoney), online video streaming services (YouTube), etc.\n\nB2B integration streamlines transactions and document sharing between companies, fostering improved collaboration and trade with suppliers, customers, and partners.\n\nExample: connecting online banking systems with loan organization systems from other financial institutions.\n\nIntegration enhances business efficiency by facilitating improved communication and sharing of relevant information among different systems. Often, integration reduces errors and minimizes redundant tasks, optimizing productivity. Additionally, integration simplifies the workflows by providing easy access to customer data and enabling seamless interactions through a unified interface.\n\nIn the banking industry, software integration delivers a win-win scenario for both banks and customers.\n• Up-to-date data availability: Through integrated banking systems, banks acquire real-time and precise information across many departments, facilitating collaboration and informed decision-making. Fintech integration ensures timely access to accurate information when needed, helping eliminate outdated and disparate information.\n• Decreased manual errors: Efficient data flow between systems reduces the requirement for manual data entry, thus minimizing the likelihood of human errors. This improves data accuracy and reliability, ultimately enhancing operational efficiency and compliance with regulations.\n• Improved decision-making capabilities: Integrated banking solutions offer consolidated data and extensive insights, resulting in a complete perspective on the institution’s performance and customer behavior. With this information, banks can make strategic decisions driven by data, streamline processes, and quickly adjust to market shifts.\n• Personalization: With centralized customer data from separate systems, financial institutions can gain comprehensive knowledge about their users’ preferences and behaviors, which allows businesses to customize their service efforts and target offers that resonate with each individual customer.\n• Seamless digital experience: Integrated software streamlines transaction processes, enhancing the speed and convenience of banking experiences. This seamless process also helps users save time and effort.\n\nOrganizations can achieve automation and complete visibility into their business operations through data and process integration. However, integration projects can be among the most difficult to implement since they often involve diverse user groups and technical challenges, spanning from data migration and integration management to process automation and service management.\n\nTo ensure effective integration and expedite return on investments, it’s essential to follow a few critical steps.\n\nEvery integration process begins with the evaluation of the software to be integrated and mapping out a realistic strategy. Therefore, businesses should clearly identify the platforms that need to be integrated and the shared data, possible risks related to the integrations (i.e., data loss), as well as the budget and available resources for the integration project.\n\nFor the BFSI industry, having a thorough strategy is an advantage, A well-defined bank integration strategy is important before initiating any integrated bank technology project. This includes conducting a comprehensive assessment of current systems, defining bank integration objectives, and outlining a step-by-step implementation roadmap.\n\nYour integrations probably hold sensitive business data and personally identifiable information (PII). Unauthorized access to either type of data may compromise your compliance with data privacy regulations, damaging your organization’s reputation.\n\nTo reduce potential issues, proactive security measures can be implemented, which comprise encrypting data during transmission and storage, utilizing secure authentication methods like OAuth 2.0, and maintaining logs to audit integrations over time.\n\nTo ensure seamless interaction among different modules and accurate data transmission, it’s essential for businesses to perform integration testing regularly. Companies can use System Integration Testing ( SIT) to validate the interactions of software and all the system parts.\n• Testing the integration with the payment gateway\n• Verifying the interaction between the app and the ATM system to ensure seamless functions such as cash withdrawal and deposit, account balance inquiry, cash, and check deposits.\n• Testing the integration between the UI and the policy management system.\n\nWhen developing integrations for customer interaction, software engineers may encounter challenges in meeting the diverse demands of customers. Since users may seek connections with various app categories, and within each category, they may use multiple apps, it can be challenging to keep pace.\n\nTo address customer integration requirements efficiently, investing in a unified API solution is worth considering.\n\n5. Consider Engaging a Trusted Partner to Help with Integrations\n\nEngaging an expert partner can support the execution of an effective integration strategy, which is particularly vital if your internal resources lack the necessary skills.\n\nIf you’re aiming to elevate your business through updated systems, collaborating with professionals in software integration services is worth considering.

        "document": "Integrating business systems can have many benefits. One of the main reasons for integrating business systems is to improve communication and collaboration within an organization. This can help to streamline processes and improve efficiency, leading to increased productivity and potentially higher profits. Integration can also help reduce the risk of errors and improve data accuracy, as information can be entered and accessed in a single, centralized system. Additionally, integration can help to provide a more complete and accurate view of the business, enabling better decision-making and strategic planning.\n\nThere are many reasons why integration projects can fail. Common causes include poor communication and coordination among team members, inadequate planning and risk management, a lack of clear goals and objectives, and technical challenges. Additionally, integration projects can fail if there is a lack of support or buy-in from key stakeholders or if changes in the business environment are not anticipated. In some cases, integration projects may also fail if the teams involved are not adequately trained or do not have the necessary expertise to complete the project successfully. Let us look at some best practices to follow when integrating your systems:\n\nBefore starting the integration process, planning and preparing carefully is crucial. This phase involves several activities, including defining the project’s goals and objectives, identifying the teams and individuals involved, and developing a detailed plan for how the project will be carried out. It is also essential to identify potential risks and develop strategies for mitigating those risks. Additionally, during the planning and preparation phase, teams should establish clear lines of communication and ensure that all team members understand their roles and responsibilities. It may also be helpful to conduct training to ensure everyone has the necessary skills and knowledge to complete the project successfully.\n\nThe integration process can impact many departments and teams. It is essential to involve all relevant stakeholders in the planning and execution of the integration to ensure that their needs and concerns are addressed. These may include project sponsors, project managers, and members of the project team, as well as business leaders and other key decision-makers. Additionally, stakeholders may include customers, vendors, and other external partners affected by the project. It is crucial to identify all stakeholders early in the project planning process and to involve them in critical decision-making and planning activities. This can help ensure that the project aligns with the goals of all stakeholders and that they are committed to supporting the project’s success.\n\nBefore integrating your systems, it is essential to comprehensively analyze your existing systems to understand their capabilities and limitations. This involves identifying the existing systems and processes that will be affected by the project and evaluating their capabilities and limitations. This analysis should include a thorough review of the current systems, including their architecture, data structures, and integration points. It may also be helpful to conduct a gap analysis to identify areas where the existing systems do not meet the project’s requirements or might need additional functionality. This analysis can help project teams identify potential challenges and opportunities and develop a plan to integrate the systems to maximize their capabilities and minimize disruption.\n\nWhen integrating your systems, It is essential to analyze how the integrated system will need to evolve and adapt over time to support the changing needs of the business. This may involve identifying areas where the current systems could be more scalable and flexible enough to accommodate future growth and developing strategies for addressing those limitations. It may also include considering how the integrated system will work with new technologies or processes in the future and developing a plan for how to handle those changes. Additionally, it is essential to involve key stakeholders in this planning process to ensure that the integrated system will meet their needs and support the business’s long-term growth.\n\nOnce your systems are integrated, it is essential to thoroughly test and verify the integration to ensure that it is working as expected. This involves thoroughly reviewing the integrated system to ensure that it functions as intended and meets the project’s goals and objectives. It may include unit testing, which focuses on individual components or modules of the system, and integration testing, which focuses on how the different components of the system work together. It may also include functional testing, which ensures that the system performs the tasks it was designed to do, and performance testing, which evaluates the system’s speed and reliability. Testing should be conducted throughout the project, with regular checks to ensure that the system is functioning as expected. This can help identify and fix any problems before they impact the project’s success."

        "document": "SaaS sprawl is a challenge for every enterprise. The more applications and systems in the workforce, the wider the communication gap between teams.\n\nThe only solution is to explore viable enterprise applications integration tools to create an interconnected web of work management systems and CRMs (customer relationships management).\n\nDone right, enterprise integration applications can make collaborations silky smooth. Done wrong, it could create more issues for the involved teams and enterprises.\n\nTo help you ace the integration of enterprise applications, I’ll cover everything worth knowing about this topic. You’ll find out the benefits, challenges, use cases, and best practices to follow.\n\nEnterprise application integration is the process of using a custom script, API middleware, or a third-party tool to connect multiple systems used within or across organizations to create an interconnected ecosystem.\n\nCompanies depend on EAI for smooth cooperation between teams and cross-company collaborations with MSPs, suppliers, and clients.\n\nThe integration solution, by bridging the compatibility and communication gap between systems, also helps exchange data and provide real-time updates.\n\nWhat are the Goals of Enterprise Applications Integration?\n\nThe specific goal of using enterprise data integration applications varies by company and objectives. Some of them include:\n• Data integration between systems to unify formats and avoid duplication. This, for instance, can include syncing sales data between Salesforce and Jira. Data formats in these systems can be “ ” or “ ”. So, unifying them makes sure the data stays and means the same on both sides.\n• Workflow integration between teams or organizations to increase productivity and efficiency of collaborations. IT teams can improve service management by syncing data from the support team’s ServiceNow instance.\n• Interface integration between both sides of the integration in order to provide a unified view, with either of them having to leave their respective environments.\n\nLet’s use a sample connection scenario between Salesforce and ServiceNow to explore how enterprise application integration works.\n\nOn one end, you have a Salesforce org. On the other end, you have a ServiceNow instance. But since both platforms cannot interact natively, you’d need an integration solution to mediate between them.\n\nSo here is a breakdown of what happens:\n• The Sales team (using Salesforce) creates a Case for a customer.\n• The third-party integration solution analyzes the newly created entity to determine if it meets the conditions for synchronization. It then interacts with the Salesforce API to fetch the response.\n• The solution converts the record from Salesforce to a ServiceNow-readable format.\n• A ServiceNow Incident, Change Request, or Problem is created to replicate the Salesforce Case based on the custom mappings.\n• The support agents can now escalate the new Incident to the development team via Jira Service Management while making sure the Sales team gets timely updates with the designated fields in the Salesforce Case.\n\nWhat are the Types of Enterprise Applications Integration?\n\nThe working mechanism differs for several EAI solutions. Here they are:\n• Point-to-point integration: Also called peer-to-peer integration, this involves connecting the endpoints of two separate software applications or systems directly to exchange data and communicate without intermediaries.\n• Hub-and-spoke integration: This involves a central hub and different spokes. The central hub connects with multiple systems simultaneously to process the data upon request. Hub-and-spoke integrations are usually unidirectional. So, if the MSP has a system integrated with clients, the flow of updates goes only from the MSP to the client and not the other way around.\n• Microservices integration: This involves breaking down the entire system architecture into small, lightweight applications. It allows you to integrate only the needed services instead of the entire system. For example, you can integrate only the ticketing system in Zendesk with Jira instead of the entire solution.\n• Enterprise service bus (ESB) integration: This is a variation of the hub-and-spoke approach that allows applications to interact with each other and perform message transformation, protocol transformation, routing, and authentication.\n\nOrganizations explore integrating their enterprise applications for various generic and specific reasons.\n\nOverall, more than 83% of organizations have implemented it.\n\nOne drawback of having SaaS applications isolated within an organization is that data gets siloed. But by integrating these systems, your company can break down these siloes and get all the teams to access data freely according to their permissions.\n\nIf a process involves multiple enterprise applications—say the sales enablement team uses both Salesforce and Jira—integrating them would make the sales process more efficient.\n\nSo your team would have access to all the sales and customer data in order to streamline the process and avoid duplication of efforts.\n\nConstruction company Nevaris Build used an EAI tool to improve workflow efficiency between their QA experts and devs. The result was decreased issue-handling times.\n\nInstead of paying to onboard new applications, teams can continue using their existing enterprise application.\n\nFor instance, when you integrate ServiceNow and Zendesk, either side won’t have to pay the extra licensing and infrastructure fees to get the data they need.\n\nPiotr Radtke confirmed the cost savings as the Senior Project manager at Netguru.\n\nThe company significantly reduced license costs and connected DevOps with its ITSM and business teams.\n\nWhen all the teams have a clear view of customer data, they’ll be able to provide a consistent experience on all channels. The admins will also have access to information in real time to get updates.\n\nDaniel Miks, the Atlassian Solutions Expert at WirelessCar, explained how Exalate helped them improve the user experience.\n\nWirelessCar was able to improve the experience of the brands working with them. They synced their internal Jira with their customers’ ServiceNow instances for efficient ticket handling.\n\nTools for integrating enterprise applications come with cutting-edge technologies, such as AI-powered scripting assistants. These tools can optimize and automate syncs and workflows between systems and teams.\n\nYou can consult the AI assistant with your prompt or query to generate a script that will help you map the statuses between the two systems.\n\nWhat are the Use Cases of Enterprise Application Integration?\n\nThe general application of EAI is to connect multiple systems to share data. But to understand what this entails, let’s go through some common use cases for enterprise applications integration:\n\nIntegrating ERPs and digital inventories allows organizations to manage supply chains, coordinate supply and delivery, and track product inventory.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, connecting CRMs and sales software can help the sales team learn more about customers and deals.\n\nIntegrating the SLA details from Jira with the user information field in Salesforce will provide more insights about the deal value and the customer priority.\n\nThe IT team can manage services with ServiceNow by logging incidents, problems, requests, and other concerns.\n\nFor internal syncs, the team using Jira Service Management can get updates from the ServiceNow instance to learn the status of their concern.\n\nFor external syncs, the MSP using ServiceNow will send timely progress updates to customers in their system (Zendesk or Jira Service Management, for example) in real time without going back and forth.\n\nMarketing managers can set up the sync to be triggered whenever a high-priority ticket comes into Zendesk from Jira. They can also map the statuses, so when the ticket is set to Open, the Jira issue is set as To Do. When the ticket is Resolved, the issue is marked as Done.\n\nThe right integration solution can let you synchronize legacy systems with modern enterprise applications.\n\nSometimes, this would require modernizing the legacy system first. But other times, the application solution can address the disparity in architecture to create a functional synchronization.\n\nWhat are the Key Considerations in Enterprise Application Integration?\n\nHere are things to bear in mind when choosing an EAI platform.\n\nYou need a robust security framework to ensure that the data stages of the synchronization are secure, whether in transit or at rest.\n\nSome integration security measures to implement include multi-factor authentication, role-based access controls, firewalls, endpoint detection, and much more.\n\nIn general, stay up to date with compliance regulations to maintain top-notch privacy and security.\n\nThe solution should be accessible to every team member regardless of technical expertise. This means that they can set up and configure syncs independently without external help.\n\nThis can get tricky when scripting is involved.\n\nHowever, with features like AI Assist, users can generate context-relevant scripts in minutes by relying on user prompts.\n\nThe EAI solution should be able to scale with your infrastructure as the number of users, platforms, and operations increase. Once the solution can distribute the load across the system, the performance will stay consistent and flexible to demand.\n\nWhether you decide to build or buy the integration solution, the cost should be within your budget and needs. Look for solutions that offer features you actually need to achieve your integration goals.\n\nOnly go for enterprise application integration, which your available team can configure and set up. This will reduce the overhead cost of hiring engineers and training staff to use it.\n\nHere are some of the best applications for enterprise integration.\n\nExalate is a bidirectional integration solution that supports two-way syncs between work management systems and CRMs such as Jira, Salesforce, Azure DevOps, Zendesk, and ServiceNow.\n\nExalate comes in two configuration modes: the Basic mode and the Script mode.\n\nWith the Basic mode, you get pre-built sync mappings that cannot be configured. For instance, you can create a Jira issue from a Salesforce case and only sync the basic fields. This mode is available for free.\n\nThe Script mode allows you to set up simple to advanced use cases, such as connecting multiple Zendesk tickets to a single Jira issue.\n\nIt comes with a Groovy scripting engine and an embedded AI chatbot. This AI-enabled integration feature is helpful if you want to generate scripts based on the prompts you provide.\n\nYou can also set up triggers for automating synchronization events, which you can manage in the Sync Queue where all active and pending connections can be viewed.\n\nSnapLogic is an iPaaS that supports the connection of enterprise cloud services, SaaS applications, and legacy systems.\n\nIt comes with API management solutions and SnapLogic Autosync for automated data ingestion. You can also integrate applications with pre-built connectors or “Snaps”.\n\nSnapAI includes several modules that use artificial intelligence, such as AutoSuggest, GenAI Builder, SnapGPT, and AutoPrep.\n\nHarmony is an EAI platform that allows you to build applications and establish automated connections between systems and interfaces.\n\nThe Harmony API manager speeds up API creation. Harmony EDI also helps users manage electronic data interchange between organizations through a repository of pre-built connectors.\n\nZapier is a no-code enterprise application integration platform used to connect over 7000 applications.\n\nThe main selling point of Zapier is that it allows the integration of systems without writing any code. You can use custom workflow automation called Zaps to connect multiple systems.\n\nZapier also supports custom workflow visualization pages called Interfaces and AI chatbots, highlighting the future of AI Chatbots with smooth customer conversations.\n\nWorkato is an enterprise integration solution that allows businesses to automate workflows and connect all cloud and on-premise apps.\n\nWhen using Workato, you can connect the Enterprise iPaaS feature to integrate business data and processes. You can manage API and orchestrate data exchange between platforms.\n\nWorkato Workbots can also improve response time, while Recipes allow you to create automated triggers and actions for complex workflows.\n\nWhat are some Challenges of Implementing Enterprise Application Integration?\n\nThe first challenge associated with implementing EAI platforms is complexity. Since the underlying technologies are complex and different, you need to account for these variations when choosing or building an integration solution.\n\nAnother challenge is legacy applications. If you don’t have a dedicated engineering team to understand the legacy system’s infrastructure, the sync might end up leading to data loss and inaccuracies.\n\nSecurity is also a major challenge when implementing EAI systems. Since sensitive business and customer data is being exchanged across systems, they are vulnerable to external threats.\n\nWhether for external or internal practices, both sides must employ robust security and data encryption measures to guarantee safety and privacy.\n\nWhat are the Best Practices of Enterprise Integration?\n\nIf you want the enterprise integration to work smoothly, here are some best practices to follow:\n• Carry out an extensive evaluation to discover the best approach for integrating the involved systems. Involve stakeholders on both sides of the connection to make sure they share their concerns and ideas.\n• Run tests before implementing any integration on a broader scale. This will help you fix minor issues before they snowball into company-wide disasters. If you map the wrong fields or values, data could get lost.\n• Document every process and action pertaining to the EAI implementation to guarantee smooth continuity.\n• Conduct extensive training exercises to ensure your team members understand the necessary security measures and configuration rules required to achieve the best results.\n• Analyze usage and performance data to determine if the integration is performing as expected. This will also show you areas of improvement and suggestions for optimization.\n\nEnterprises, suppliers, outsourcing companies, MSPs, and e-commerce entities rely on Exalate to connect their applications.\n\nExalate uses AI to make scripting easier and more accurate:\n• Aida is a standalone AI documentation assistant that you can use to fetch vital information from the Exalate documentation.\n• AI Assist is a dedicated AI script builder intrinsically embedded in the configuration console.\n\nBoth systems accept user prompts and process them in order to generate code snippets for scripting connections and mappings, but the expected output from each can be different.\n\nIf you have specific enterprise applications you want to integrate using Exalate, contact our solutions engineers for a free demo."

Why is Integration Testing Important For Your Enterprise?\n\nIntegration testing plays a crucial role in the success and reliability of software projects within an enterprise. Here are the key reasons why it is important:\n• Early Detection of Issues: This testing helps businesses discover defects at the early stages of development. This proactive approach helps ensure a smoother and more efficient development cycle.\n• Improved Product Quality: When individual modules are tested together, integration testing ensures that they work seamlessly as a cohesive unit. Higher product quality translates to fewer bugs and a better user experience, ultimately enhancing the reputation of the enterprise.\n• Efficient Collaboration: For large projects involving multiple development teams or third-party vendors, integration testing facilitates better coordination and communication. It ensures that all components, regardless of their origin, work together harmoniously.\n• Validation of Interfaces and Data Flow: This testing phase confirms that the interfaces between modules are correctly defined and implemented. It verifies that data flows accurately between components, ensuring consistent and reliable data handling across the system.\n• Continuous Improvement: Integration testing encourages a culture of constant testing and feedback. This ongoing process leads to continuous improvements in the software.\n\n3. What Are the Differences Between Unit Testing And Integration Testing?\n\nUnit testing and integration testing are two fundamental testing approaches in software development, each serving distinct purposes and focusing on different aspects of an application.\n• Unit testing focuses on individual components or functions in isolation, ensuring they work correctly on their own.\n• Integration testing, on the other hand, examines how different components of an application work together, including their interactions and dependencies.\n\nEnsures that various components function as expected in conjunction\n\nLevel of IsolationUses mock objects and stubs to simulate interactions with other unitsUtilizes real data and actual components to test real-world interactionsExecutionGenerally quick and simple to execute due to the limited scopeSlower and more complex due to the involvement of multiple integrated componentsMaintenanceIt is easier to maintain as changes in one unit do not affect othersMore challenging to maintain due to dependencies between integrated componentsCostLower cost due to limited scope and simpler setupHigher cost due to complexity and the need for a more comprehensive setupDevelopment PhaseUsually performed during the early stages of development to catch bugs earlyConducted after unit testing, during later stages of development, to ensure integrated system functionalityTest TechniqueWhitebox Testing: tests internal structures or workings of an enterprise application, as opposed to its functionality.Blackbox Testing: examines the functionality of an enterprise application without peering into its internal structuresTest SpeedTypically faster because it tests individual units or components in isolationGenerally slower as it involves testing multiple components or systems togetherBug IdentificationIdentifies bugs at a granular level, pinpointing issues in specific units of codeIdentifies issues related to the interaction between components or systemsTest CoverageFocuses on individual units, leading to detailed testing of small code segmentsCovers the interaction between units, leading to broader test coverage of combined functionality\n\nVarious approaches can be employed to conduct integration testing, each with its own set of advantages and challenges.

How To Do Integration Testing?\n\nIntegration testing is a key step in the software development lifecycle. Here’s a detailed guide on how to conduct integration testing effectively:\n\nCreating an integration testing plan is the foundational step in the integration testing process. This plan should be comprehensive and detailed, capable of answering all questions related to units, key goals, and functionalities.\n• Scope: Specify which modules will be integrated and tested together.\n• Approach: Choose one of these strategies above for integration testing.\n• Resources: Identify the team members who will be involved in the testing process, including their roles and responsibilities.\n• Criteria for Success: Define what constitutes a successful test. This might include specific performance metrics, error thresholds, and other qualitative factors.\n• Testing Objectives: Outline the primary goals of the integration testing, such as verifying the seamless interaction between modules and identifying interface defects.\n• Testing Environment: Detail the environment in which the tests will be conducted (hardware, software, network configurations, and any necessary test data).\n• Schedule: Develop a timeline that maps out each phase of the testing process.\n• Testing Tools: List the tools and technologies that will be used for testing. Some popular automation testing tools include Katalon Studio, Appium, Selenium, etc.\n\nExamining and prioritizing relevant use cases is for making sure that integration testing focuses on the most important aspects of the system:\n• Identification: Start by listing all possible use cases for the system. Use cases are descriptions of how users will interact with the system to achieve specific goals.\n• Prioritization: Determine which use cases are most critical to the system’s functionality and user satisfaction. Consider factors such as the frequency of use, business impact, and potential risks associated with each use case.\n\nAccording to the defined plan, there are several integration tests available such as risky-hardest, top-down, etc. Then, continuously monitor the test execution to ensure it proceeds as expected. This involves observing the system’s behavior and identifying any anomalies or issues that arise during testing.\n\nDetecting and analyzing errors during integration testing is essential for identifying and resolving issues:\n• Error Detection: Utilize automated tools and manual methods to scan for errors. Automated tools can quickly identify common issues, such as interface mismatches and data handling errors, while manual testing can uncover more subtle problems.\n• Analysis: Once errors are detected, analyze them to determine their root causes. This involves understanding whether the issue lies within the code, the integration points, or the environment setup.\n\nAfter identifying and fixing errors, you need to retest to check whether the fixes address the identified issues. It means rerunning the specific test cases that previously failed to confirm that the errors have been resolved.\n\nThe final step is to ensure all errors have been addressed and the system is fully functional:\n• Validation: This includes testing for performance, security, and usability to ensure the system is robust and reliable.\n• Sign-off: Obtain formal sign-off from stakeholders once the system passes all integration tests and meets the defined success criteria. This indicates that the system is ready for deployment and further stages of development or production.\n\nWhen performing integration testing in a banking application, the top priority is to verify how different components interact to ensure seamless operation.\n• Check Balance Adjustments After a Transaction: Confirm that when a user transfers money, their balance decreases by the appropriate amount, and the recipient’s balance increases by the correct amount, considering any applicable fees.\n• Validate Accurate Account Updates Post-Transaction: Ensure that any transactions, such as deposits or withdrawals, correctly update the user’s account balance and are properly recorded in the transaction history.\n• Check Correct Generation of Account Statements: Verify that account statements are generated accurately, reflecting the transaction history and any interest earned.\n• Confirm Data Consistency Across Transactions: Make sure that data remains consistent after transactions, without causing unexpected conflicts or errors.\n• Test Bonus Points System: For banks with a bonus point system, verify that bonus points increase correctly after specific activities are recorded.\n\nTo ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of integration testing, adhering to these best practices:\n• Start integration testing early: Early integration testing helps in identifying and addressing issues at the initial stages, preventing the accumulation of defects and reducing the cost and effort of fixing them later. Teams can catch integration-related issues as soon as new code is integrated.\n• Testing in small batches: This is another effective approach. Instead of integrating and testing the entire system at once, break down the system into smaller, manageable modules and test them incrementally. This approach, often referred to as incremental integration, makes it easier to pinpoint the source of defects and reduces the complexity of debugging.\n• A well-structured integration testing plan: This plan should include clearly defined test cases, test data, testing environment, and timelines. It should also specify the order in which modules will be integrated and tested.\n• Utilizing mock objects and stubs: Mock objects and stubs also enable testing of scenarios that might be difficult to reproduce with real dependencies, such as error conditions or edge cases.\n\nBy thoroughly testing the integrations, businesses can identify and resolve issues that unit tests might miss. It ultimately enhances the reliability and performance of their applications.\n\nKMS Solutions focuses on delivering thorough and efficient testing processes that ensure all components of your system work harmoniously together. Our approach focuses on minimizing risks associated with integration failures, optimizing performance, and ensuring that your systems work harmoniously together, regardless of their complexity.\n\nAdditionally, we also provide a wide range of integration testing solutions designed to address the unique challenges of enterprise applications.

        "document": "Third-party integrations with accounting software like NetSuite or QuickBooks allow your finance team to collect and share information between applications and systems. Essentially, this gives them the ability to complete multiple business functions in a single place, through consolidated data.\n\nData integrity is the cornerstone of effective integrations. With quality or format issues, you run the risk of having trouble with more than just your accounting software – it could impact your entire business.\n\nThankfully, there are several ways to overcome data issues in third-party integrations.\n\nProblems with your data can significantly affect the efficiency, reliability, and effectiveness of your business.\n\nFormatting problems arise when the structure in which data is stored, processed, and transmitted across integrations does not match. After all, each format has its own standards dictating how information is encoded.\n\nCompatibility issues arise when two or more systems can’t exchange information because the data is incompatible. This could be due to a number of reasons, including:\n• Duplications from various sources may lead to duplication of your records, especially if you’ve been using a combination of local and cloud databases. This can wreak havoc with your data analysis.\n• Inaccuracies . Accurate data isn’t just essential in finance – it’s vital for every department. Unfortunately, it can be caused by a number of factors, including human error, data drift or decay, or inefficient integrations.\n• Downtime . If you can’t access the information you need, because the data is unreliable or not available, you can lose valuable time. Moreover, the costs of data retrieval and system maintenance can rack up quickly.\n\nThe reason for these challenges is mainly due to diverse data standards between systems. When platforms use different formats, they may not translate well across systems. Moreover, with constant technological advances, it can be difficult to keep systems synchronized, especially when combining older platforms with new integrations.\n\nThe potential impact on your business operations\n\nIncompatible accounting data can lead to gaps in financial reporting, skewed metrics, or trouble visualizing your data for decision-making. In a nutshell, this can negatively impact your bottom line, through operational delays and increased costs. This, in turn, can reduce efficiency across departments. More importantly, not handling data correctly during integration can lead to data loss or corruption.\n\nNot only can this impair decision-making and analysis, but it can lead to a loss of trust on the part of your clients or customers, and severe reputational damage.\n\nWhen it comes to third-party integrations with your accounting software, it’s crucial to ensure your data is formatted to be compatible with all systems accessing the information.\n\nThird-party integration with your accounting software generally leads to the same kinds of format issues. These can be structural or semantic. Structural discrepancies occur when data formats don’t align, including dates or currencies. Semantic inconsistencies happen when data values misrepresent the same entity, such as with abbreviations.\n• Date formats : Depending on your region and software, programs can encode dates in one of three ways; MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, or YYYY-MM-DD.\n• CSV, XML and JSON : CSV (Comma-Separated Values) doesn’t support metadata or complex hierarchies the way XML and JSON do. Also, these systems use different delimiters (like commas and semicolons), and parse differently.\n• Decimals : Numbers can easily be misrepresented if you have different rules for decimals in your software. This is particularly problematic between geographic regions – for example, in the US we use 1,000.00, while in Europe the same number is written as 1.000,00.\n• Character encoding : Mismatches between UTF-8, ASCII, or ISO 8859-1 can lead to corrupted text data, especially for characters not in English, including in currency exchanges.\n• Binary formats : Depending on the integration you use, your system might need to make use of binary (such as images or proprietary file formats). However, these formats are usually encoded differently.\n\nIncompatible data during third-party integrations can affect your day-to-day accounting and business operations. For starters, it can result in data loss, which can severely delay the integration process. This can have a knock-on effect on your operations. Also, having to reformat or clean up your data can be an expensive and time-consuming process.\n\nMore importantly, data troubles can have a serious effect on your company’s legal and tax compliance.\n\nDepending on your existing software, and what applications you plan to integrate, you can run into a number of compatibility changes.\n\nFor example, if you have different versions of software, they may include different features or data structures. Also, some features may be specific to a certain platform, so any changes to these may mean you will lose access to information.\n\nYour finance team might also encounter problems with limitations or differences between APIs. After all, not all accounting software provides comprehensive APIs, which could lead to variations in functionality across platforms.\n\nAnother aspect to consider is security. Security protocols like encryption or authentication may differ across integrated platforms, leaving you with a vulnerable system, or one which causes endless frustration.\n\nCustomization can add another level of complications. While accounting systems can feature a range of tailored solutions for your business, this can cause problems when synchronizing data across multiple platforms.\n\nFinally, one of the most important factors to consider is expert assistance. Whether you need help training your staff on the best ways to use new integrations, or assistance with the process itself, Fusion CPA can manage your software integration process. Our team of software pros can also help you create and integrate custom solutions that can help streamline your financial management while ensuring your data is accurate and compatible.\n\nWhen converting file formats, you’ll need to begin with the right integration method. This can be either schema-based or schema-less. The former relies on predefined mappings to align your data sources. The latter uses techniques such as fusing, matching, or clustering your data to reconcile it.\n\nThen, you can begin the conversion process. Start by defining your conversion criteria and objectives for transforming data, depending on how it will be used.\n\nThere are various tools and techniques available to simplify this process. These include:\n• ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools are designed to extract and transform data to match the format of the target system. These are helpful if you need to\n• Middleware works like a middleman to let two systems communicate. This is a great help for custom-built platforms with unconventional data formats.\n• Data mapping tools help you to define how data fields in one system correspond to those in another, for example, when linking payroll systems.\n• API management tools help connect the APIs of different systems.\n• Custom programming is also an option, although this can be expensive and time-consuming.\n\nRegardless of what system you choose, accuracy is key. Every step of the process should be carefully monitored and tested to prevent errors.\n\nSo how do you ensure that you’ll have data compatibility during third-party integrations? The key is preparation. For example, API versioning is the process of implementing API version control. That way, you can manage any changes without disrupting existing integrations. This means that older systems will continue to function with stable API versions, while newer integrations can use updated features.\n\nAnother option is to use common standards. By adopting accepted standards and protocols for data formats and security, you’ll allow different systems to interact with ease, and prevent data mishaps.\n\nAnd then there’s data mapping, whereby your team ensures that all data fields are mapped from the source to target systems.\n\nAlternatively, you could use modular architecture, by designing systems with components that can be updated on their own, without affecting the whole software ecosystem. For example, NetSuite features modules that can be integrated with add-ons.\n\nTesting is the best way to ensure that your third-party integrations are efficient, and your data accurate. It encompasses several phases and strategies.\n\nThe process starts with unit testing, in which individual components like APIs or scripts are trialed. Next, combine these components into a group to test that they work together. Thereafter, conduct a system test to ensure that the entire integration is functioning properly.\n\nBut how do you do this?\n\nOne option is through automation, where available testing tools do the heavy lifting for you. Another option is load testing (in which scenarios are simulated to determine that your systems function well). Finally, you should always conduct regression testing after any updates or additional integration, to make sure everything’s still on track.\n\nEffective planning and testing will make the process of integrating third-party applications with your accounting software much more efficient. But there are also other aspects to consider. These include:\n• Data validation . By ensuring that the information transferred between systems is accurate, complete, and meets predefined standards, you can minimize the risk of data incompatibility. This requires robust data checks before any information is imported into your system.\n• Standardizing formats and protocols . It’s good practice to standardize formatting across systems from the start, to ensure long-term continuity. This means that you’ll need to establish and internal governance to ensure that everyone follows the same guidelines.\n• Maintenance and error logging . Any issues that crop up, along with how they’re resolved, should be documented to ensure mistakes aren’t repeated, and that you have an error log to refer back to.\n• Accurate data entry . With data that’s entered correctly, you’ll mitigate the risk of duplicate records or missing information, which can lead to a smoother integration process.\n• Regular reconciliation . If your accounting software allows for automation, it’s a good idea to set up automated reconciliation processes to verify that transactions and data match between your integrations and accounting software.\n\nIf these measures pose challenges to your team, you can always reach out to an expert, or consider outsourcing your integration management.\n\nTo avoid problems down the line, your finance team needs to be proactive about data handling. That means robust governance policies and effective communication. This also relies on effective training for all users – after all, your system is only as good as the people using it!\n\nIt’s also important to get expert advice and assistance, especially if you need custom integrations. By entrusting your software ecosystem to professionals, you can ensure that your data is handled accurately, while maintaining legal and regulatory compliance.\n\nIf you need assistance with third-party accounting integrations or help ensuring your business has efficient accounting data handling processes in place, schedule a Discovery Call with one of our team.

        "document": "As your organization grows in size, your business adopts various software systems and applications to be more efficient at scale. The use of different applications in your day-to-day operations further creates data silos and data inconsistency. The lack of complete business data visibility often leads to a lack of business agility, which is critical for your business to compete in today’s fast-paced marketplace.\n\nOne reliable solution to address these challenges is to deploy enterprise application integration (EAI) in your organization across the entire enterprise’s infrastructure. It allows you to streamline business processes, improve data accuracy, and achieve complete visibility of data across the organization.\n\nIn this blog, we will explore the importance of enterprise application integration (EAI) systems, advantages, best practices, and strategies to keep your business moving toward growth.\n\nEnterprise Application Integration (EAI) is a strategic approach to connect and unify diverse disparate software systems and applications within an organization. It enables data, resources, and processes to be consolidated and share across different applications. This helps you seamlessly connect various on-premises & cloud apps to transform & utilize data for smooth workflows.\n\nIt is over a common platform and requires data integration in the back end for the smooth functioning of the connected applications. Further, EAI helps streamline processes like billing, marketing, accounting, and customer relationship management with increased data availability. It helps establish a middleware framework that enables free data flow between applications without significantly changing the database configurations or the applications themselves.\n\nNow that you know that EAI connects disparate applications to enable a seamless flow of data, let’s explore the multiple benefits it delivers to your organization.\n\nEnterprise application integration offers several significant advantages for enterprises and organizations of all sizes. By integrating different software systems, EAI can help improve information sharing, streamline business processes, reduce IT complexity, and increase agility.\n\nAre you wondering how EAI technologies can simplify all critical concerns? Read this if you wish to get a clear insight into the business benefits of EAI.\n\nAs there is no one-size-fits-all approach for integration, there are various models that help establish a connection between different applications. We’ll explore five essential types of enterprise application integration models that you should be aware of.\n\nIt handles simple interactions between two data sources.\n• As part of this approach, a script pulls, translates & transfers information from one application to another.\n• Proves to be effective with relatively small operations and become inefficient while handling several systems all at once.\n\nAs the name suggests, this model uses a central “hub” where applications and systems connect via “spokes.”\n• The information is reformatted and distributed from one central database, thus eliminating the need to interconnect subsystems.\n• Yet the development team would still have to engage components that would automatically set the route information to the appropriate destination.\n\nAn advanced method of the hub-and-spoke model, it performs the same tasks but in a different architecture.\n• It runs without human interference, using a defined set of standards that govern data flow between applications.\n• It enables data transmittance and retrieval as the rules of each service.\n\nThis software routes traffic between application interfaces and operating systems to translate & support communication. It simplifies data aggregation across systems using different scripts and formats.\n\nThis is the standardized architecture for modern cloud-based enterprise applications. Organizations that use web-based integration can collect big data through internal and external sources with the help of application programming interfaces (APIs).\n\nAn enterprise application integration (EAI) strategy is a plan for connecting and integrating the various software applications used by an organization. It allows businesses to share data and automate system processes. EAI strategy can help businesses improve their operations, make better decisions, and be more agile. Let us help you understand the comprehensive overview of these strategies below.\n\nIrrespective of whether applications are used for internal or external-facing software, enterprise application integration helps synchronize all databases, thus allowing complete data access throughout a business. Herein, an application reads information from another app or software and begins the integration process. With data transfer, a relationship needs to be established between various elements like file format, location, standards, privileges & more, which should be created beforehand between both parts.\n\nMost organizations have individual databases that help teams carry out daily activities. However, since many people have access to it, there are chances of duplication and redundant storage of information. With the right application integration strategy, you can centralize all the information in a single repository that can be used multiple times and yet avoid duplication & buildup of unnecessary information.\n\nThis takes place when an application exposes its function through an interface that acts as a layer to manage complex datasets. It enables transparency, asynchronous communication and scalability to boost efficiency. With a robust and defined interface, other applications can make use of it.\n\nWith a messaging integration strategy, various applications within an organization stay connected through a messaging bus. The bus helps with the exchange of information, functions, and data, thus creating a seamless flow of communication.\n\nThe ESB infrastructure and the architectural model powered by the SOA technology are the most preferred methods of integration by organizations.\n\nThe EAI implementation plan provides a step-by-step guide to developing and deploying a successful EAI solution for your organization.\n\nStart by conducting a comprehensive assessment of your enterprise application integration requirements. It requires identifying the applications and systems that need integration, determining the data to be shared, and optimizing business processes. Some key factors to consider include your current IT infrastructure, business objectives, and available resources. Gain a clear understanding of your integration needs to guide the subsequent steps.\n\nAfter identifying your integration requirements, the next step involves selecting an appropriate architecture model for your enterprise application integration system. There are three main options:\n• Point-to-Point Integration: This straightforward approach involves direct connections between individual applications. While simple, it can be challenging to maintain and expand as your organization grows.\n• Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) Integration: An ESB acts as a central hub enabling communication between numerous applications. While this architecture offers scalability and manageability, its implementation can be intricate and involve higher costs.\n• Hybrid Integration: This model combines point-to-point and ESB integration, making it suitable for organizations with diverse application and system integration needs. It integrates cloud-based services and on-premises systems and applications of your organizations to work as a connected unit.\n\nOnce you’ve settled on an architecture model, identify the specific integration technologies you’ll employ. This includes selecting EAI software, hardware, and networking infrastructure. When choosing EAI software, consider factors such as:\n• Features: Ensure the software supports your chosen integration architecture, data formats, and messaging protocols.\n• Scalability: Assess the software’s capacity to handle large data volumes and transactions.\n• Security: Verify the software’s security features to protect your data.\n\nWith your technology stack in place, the next step involves designing and implementing your EAI system. This involves creating integration logic and configuring enterprise application integration software. It’s crucial to thoroughly test the system before deploying it in a live production environment to detect and rectify any issues that may impact your operations.\n\nOnce your EAI system is operational, continuous monitoring and management are essential to ensure system availability and efficient performance. It also helps to maintain data integrity and detect security threats before they cause any damage. This includes:\n• Performance Monitoring: Keep an eye on the system’s performance and respond to any irregularities promptly.\n• Error Tracking: Monitor for errors and implement necessary fixes.\n• Security Maintenance: Regularly apply security patches and updates to safeguard your data.\n\nIt’s also essential to have a disaster recovery and business continuity plan in place to ensure your enterprise application integration system can operate even in challenging circumstances.\n\nEnterprise Application Integration (EAI) is the key to seamless data exchange in modern business. Yet, EAI comes with its challenges. You must, therefore, follow a set of best practices to ensure a successful integration process. Here are some practical best practices that will help you simplify your business operations and provide an ideal path to a more integrated and agile enterprise.\n\nLaying down a solid enterprise application integration strategy is a must, and an expert EAI team can help you layout the plan. Keeping the end goal in mind is a must and here are four ways to overcome deployment issues:\n• Monitoring – The primary components included in enterprise software must be enabled for real-time monitoring. By analyzing how your current systems are performing, instrumentation helps with clear identification of CPU utilization, system and memory utilization, or open resource connections. This information provides the development team and administrators with the support they need to design and implement an integration architecture that can streamline and operate the system at optimal performance.\n• Accountability – Apart from the initial support and installation, updates for integration rules and components like adapters may need regular activity. The components and regular updates ensure the continuity of operations.\n• Service Level Agreements – The SLA is offered before installation and underlines the system’s requirements at run-time regarding availability, system performance characteristics, and resource consumption.\n• Deployment Plan Upfront – A deployment plan brings to the surface important issues rather than having to deal with them at a later stage. It ensures that the integration is deployed in a controlled and coordinated manner while minimizing the amount of downtime and disruption to business operations.\n\nAPIs are crucial for enterprise application integration as they help two or more applications seamlessly interact with each other especially when critical data is concerned. Web APIs are easily available on the internet and are made with XML or JSON to create connectors for apps. Since APIs provide a pre-packaged for connecting specific applications, connectors can help build and deploy solutions like ERP using plug & play models.\n\nMaintenance of data consistency is another crucial best practice since integration can create issues with data quality. Since EAI systems exchange data between different applications, the chances of duplication, data loss & wrong entries are quite possible. Therefore, Proper mechanisms must be in place to prevent data quality issues as well as mechanisms that drive data transformation and validation.\n\nDesigning data structures is also important for flexible ways of adding new tables and fields. Common data rules like the canonical data model (CDM) can be applied across the organization to provide a single, consistent view of data across all integrated applications. Further, application connectors should be used during integration to reduce the time spent on writing manual integration connectors and improve reliability.\n\nUtilize middleware platforms that offer tools and services for designing, deploying, monitoring, and managing integrations. When you invest in dependable middleware platforms, it enhances data security and scalability and lays the foundation for future integrations. Popular choices include MuleSoft, Apache Camel, and IBM Integration Bus.\n\nAfter implementing your EAI solution, it is essential to test it thoroughly to ensure that it meets your requirements. Regular monitoring is crucial, helping detect and swiftly resolve any emerging issues. This proactive approach ensures the seamless flow of data and processes, maintaining the efficiency and reliability of your integrated system.\n\nThe deployment of EAI strategy varies across organizations and is influenced by the application integration tools, data patterns, and business-specific use cases. Some organizations prefer to build a point-to-point integration from scratch, while others prefer to use the application’s APIs if they have sufficient in-house resources. So, let’s explore some of the common approaches for enterprise application integration.\n\nApplication-to-application integration offers your business comprehensive visibility into business-critical operations and processes and end-to-end processing. These are often used to connect applications without the use of a middleware layer and is often used to connect legacy systems that do not have standard APIs. It is a good choice in cases where you have to integrate a small number of legacy systems. A2A integration also enables automation and enhances productivity by eliminating the requirement for manual data entry.\n\nCurrently, many companies use multiple SaaS applications throughout their entire enterprise. The SaaS application integration approach to EAI ensures seamless data flow and integration between these SaaS applications such as CRM, ERP, and HCP systems. This approach is affordable, secure, scalable and typically uses APIs to connect applications. For instance, a large enterprise may want to integrate its cloud-based CRM with its cloud-based e-commerce platform and existing legacy ERP system. It is particularly a good approach if your business is new to EAI, has limited IT resources, or looking to integrate cloud-based and on-premise applications to prevent black boxes and data silos.\n\nThis approach is best when your business needs to integrate on-premise applications. Traditional approaches to internal application integration include specialized coding and can be expensive to implement and maintain. However, an enterprise service bus (ESB), a middleware platform that uses a rules engine to convert and route messages and enable communication across applications, is also a feasible option. The on-premise application integration approach is also preferred in cases where you need to meet specific compliance requirements that cloud-based EAI solutions cannot meet.\n\nAs a middleware platform that provides a central hub for routing and transforming data between applications, ESBs can be used to integrate all types of applications. While it is preferred in cases when you need to integrate a large number of applications and is highly customizable too, this approach is complex to implement and manage.\n\niPaaS solutions provide a suite of tools for developing and managing integrations. These offer a variety of pre-built connectors and integration templates that handle integration between SaaS solutions and cloud applications. These are easy to use, scalable, and usually hosted and managed by a third-party provider.\n\nNow that you’re aware of the best approaches for enterprise application integration, let’s explore the various tools that help your business integrate different software applications and data sources.\n\nHere are popular enterprise application integration tools to help you make the right choice for your business:\n• IBM WebSphere MQSeries: It helps you connect and integrate disparate applications and systems. With this tool, applications can communicate asynchronously without writing complex codes and access to an array of APIs.\n• BizTalk Server: This comprehensive tool includes tools and services to develop, deploy and manage EAI solutions. BizTalk’s orchestration engine supports a wide range of supported adapters which helps your organization integrate, applications from different vendors and even automate complex business processes.\n• Oracle Fusion: This tool helps with connecting the right people to your applications, even when data is scattered across places. It helps you develop, monitor & optimize processes with time and at optimal portability.\n• Workato: Whether your applications are on-premise or on the cloud, this tool helps with unifying them. You can automate workflows that integrate applications with tasks that users create with a combination of actions, triggers, and apps.\n• Cloud Elements: As one of the top enterprise application integration tools in the market, it features an API integration product with pre-built connectors that are commonly known as Elements. These elements thus support connections with various cloud service endpoints to provide event-based workflows, provide standard authentication, search & discovery APIs and unified error management.\n\nWhy is Rishabh Software the Best Choice For Your Next EAI Project?\n\nAt Rishabh Software, we employ best practices and methodologies to help you deploy best-of-breed applications to meet your organization’s unique needs.
