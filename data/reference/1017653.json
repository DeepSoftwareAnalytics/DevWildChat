        "document": "Quantum error correction 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 provides a path to reach practical quantum computing by combining multiple physical qubits into a logical qubit, in which the logical error rate is suppressed exponentially as more qubits are added. However, this exponential suppression only occurs if the physical error rate is below a critical threshold. Here we present two below-threshold surface code memories on our newest generation of superconducting processors, Willow: a distance-7 code and a distance-5 code integrated with a real-time decoder. The logical error rate of our larger quantum memory is suppressed by a factor of Λ = 2.14 ± 0.02 when increasing the code distance by 2, culminating in a 101-qubit distance-7 code with 0.143% ± 0.003 per cent error per cycle of error correction. This logical memory is also beyond breakeven, exceeding the lifetime of its best physical qubit by a factor of 2.4 ± 0.3. Our system maintains below-threshold performance when decoding in real time, achieving an average decoder latency of 63 microseconds at distance 5 up to a million cycles, with a cycle time of 1.1 microseconds. We also run repetition codes up to distance 29 and find that logical performance is limited by rare correlated error events, occurring approximately once every hour or 3 × 10 9 cycles. Our results indicate device performance that, if scaled, could realize the operational requirements of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum algorithms.\n\nQuantum computing promises computational speed-ups in quantum chemistry5, quantum simulation6, cryptography7 and optimization8. However, quantum information is fragile and quantum operations are error prone. State-of-the-art many-qubit platforms have only recently demonstrated entangling gates with 99.9% fidelity9,10, far short of the <10−10 error rates needed for many applications11,12. Quantum error correction is postulated to realize high-fidelity logical qubits by distributing quantum information for many entangled physical qubits to protect against errors. If the physical operations are below a critical noise threshold, the logical error rate should be suppressed exponentially as we increase the number of physical qubits per logical qubit. This behaviour is expressed in the approximate relation for error-corrected surface code logical qubits3,4,13. Here d is the code distance indicating 2d2 − 1 physical qubits used per logical qubit; p and ε are the physical and logical error rates, respectively; and p is the threshold error rate of the code. Thus, when p ≪ p , the error rate of the logical qubit is suppressed exponentially in the distance of the code, with the error suppression factor Λ = ε /ε ≈ p /p representing the reduction in logical error rate when increasing the code distance by two. Although many platforms have demonstrated different features of quantum error correction14,15,16,17,18,19,20, no quantum processor has definitively shown below-threshold performance. Although achieving below-threshold physical error rates is itself a formidable challenge, fault-tolerant quantum computing also imposes requirements beyond raw performance. These include features like stability for the hours-long timescales of quantum algorithms21 and the active removal of correlated error sources like leakage22. Fault-tolerant quantum computing also imposes requirements on classical co-processors—namely, the syndrome information produced by the quantum device must be decoded as fast as it is generated23. The fast operation times of superconducting qubits, ranging from tens to hundreds of nanoseconds, provide an advantage in speed but also a challenge for decoding errors both quickly and accurately. In this work, we realize surface codes operating below the threshold on two Willow processors. Using a 72-qubit processor, we implement a distance-5 surface code operating with an integrated real-time decoder. Subsequently, using a 105-qubit processor with similar performance, we realize a distance-7 surface code. These processors demonstrate Λ > 2 up to distance 5 and 7, respectively. Our distance-5 and distance-7 quantum memories are beyond breakeven, with distance-7 preserving quantum information for more than twice as long as its best constituent physical qubit. To identify possible logical error floors, we also implement high-distance repetition codes on the 72-qubit processor, with error rates that are dominated by correlated error events occurring once an hour. These errors, the origins of which are not yet understood, set a current error floor of 10−10 in the repetition code. Finally, we show that we can maintain below-threshold operation on the 72-qubit processor even when decoding in real time, meeting the strict timing requirements imposed by the fast 1.1 μs cycle duration of the processor.\n\nWe begin with results from our 105-qubit Willow processor depicted in Fig. 1a. It features a square grid of superconducting transmon qubits24 with improved operational fidelities compared with our previously reported Sycamore processors17,25. The qubits have a mean coherence time T of 68 μs and T of 89 μs, which we attribute to improved fabrication techniques, participation ratio engineering and circuit parameter optimization (Supplementary Information). Increasing coherence contributes to the fidelity of all of our operations, which are displayed in Fig. 1b. a, Schematic of a distance-7 (d = 7) surface code on a 105-qubit processor. Each measure qubit (blue) is associated with a stabilizer (blue-coloured tile). Data qubits (gold) form a d × d array. We remove leakage from each data qubit using a neighbouring qubit below it, with additional leakage removal qubits at the boundary (green). b, Cumulative distributions of error probabilities measured on the 105-qubit processor.

Curves, exponential fits after averaging p over code and basis. To compute ε values, we fit each individual code and basis separately and report their average (Supplementary Information). d, Logical error per cycle, ε , reducing with surface code distance d. Uncertainty on each point is less than 7 × 10−5. The symbols match those in c. Means for d = 3 and d = 5 are computed from the separate ε fits for each code and basis. Line, fit to equation (1), determining Λ. The inset shows simulations up to d = 11 alongside experimental points, both decoded with ensembled matching synthesis for comparison. Line, fit to simulation; Λ = 2.25 ± 0.02. We also make several improvements to decoding, using two high-accuracy offline decoders. One is a neural network decoder26, and the other is a harmonized ensemble27 of correlated minimum-weight perfect matching decoders28 augmented with matching synthesis29. These run on different classical hardware, offering two potential paths towards real-time decoding with higher accuracy. To adapt to device noise, we fine-tune the neural network with processor data26 and apply reinforcement learning optimization to the matching graph weights30. We operate a distance-7 surface code memory comprising 49 data qubits, 48 measure qubits and 4 additional leakage removal qubits17. Summarizing, we initiate surface code operation by preparing the data qubits in a product state corresponding to a logical eigenstate of either the X or Z basis of the ZXXZ surface code31. We then repeat a variable number of cycles of error correction, during which the measured qubits extract parity information from the data qubits to be sent to the decoder. After each syndrome extraction, we run data qubit leakage removal (DQLR)32 to ensure that leakage to higher states is short-lived. We measure the state of the logical qubit by measuring the individual data qubits and then check whether the corrected logical measurement outcome of the decoder agrees with the initial logical state. It is worth noting that fault-tolerant computation does not require active correction of the code state; the decoder can simply reinterpret the logical measurement outcomes13. From the surface code data, we can characterize the physical error rate of the processor using the bulk error detection probability33. This is the proportion of weight-4 stabilizer measurement comparisons that disagree with their ideal noiseless comparisons, thereby detecting an error. The surface code detection probabilities are p = (7.7%, 8.5%, 8.7%) for d = (3, 5, 7), respectively. We attribute the increase in detection probability with code size to finite size effects (Supplementary Information) and parasitic couplings between qubits. We expect both effects to saturate at larger processor sizes34. We characterize the logical performance of our surface code by fitting the logical error per cycle ε up to 250 cycles, averaged over the X and Z bases. We average the performance of nine different distance-3 subgrids and four different distance-5 subgrids to compare with the distance-7 code. Finally, we compute Λ using linear regression of ln[ε ] versus d. With our neural network decoder, we observe Λ = 2.14 ± 0.02 and ε = (1.43 ± 0.03) × 10−3 (Fig. 1c,d). With ensembled matching synthesis, we observe Λ = 2.04 ± 0.02 and ε = (1.71 ± 0.03) × 10−3. Furthermore, we simulate logical qubits of higher distances using a noise model based on the measured component error rates in Fig. 1b, additionally including leakage and stray interactions between qubits17 (Supplementary Information). These simulations are shown alongside the experiment (Fig. 1d, inset), both decoded with ensembled matching synthesis. We observe reasonable agreement with experiment and decisive error suppression, affirming that the surface codes are operating below threshold. Thus far, we have focused on Λ, because below-threshold performance guarantees that physical qubit lifetimes and operational fidelities can be surpassed with a sufficiently large logical qubit. In fact, our distance-7 logical qubit already has more than double the lifetime of its constituent physical qubits. Although comparing physical and logical qubits is subtle owing to their different noise processes, we plot a direct comparison between logical error rate and physical qubit error rate averaged over the X and Z basis initializations (Fig. 1c). To quantify the qubit lifetime itself, we uniformly average over pure states using the metric proposed elsewhere16 (Supplementary Information). The distance-7 logical qubit lifetime is 291 ± 6 μs, exceeding the lifetimes of all the constituent physical qubits (median, 85 ± 7 μs; best, 119 ± 13 μs) by a factor of 2.4 ± 0.3. Our logical memory beyond breakeven extends previous results using bosonic codes16,35,36 to multiqubit codes, and it is a critical step towards logical operation breakeven.\n\nEquipped with below-threshold logical qubits, we can now probe the sensitivity of logical error to various error mechanisms in this new regime. We start by testing how logical error scales with physical error and code distance. As shown in Fig. 2a, we inject coherent errors with variable strengths on both data and measure qubits, and extract two quantities from each injection experiment. First, we use detection probability as a proxy for the total physical error rate. Second, we infer the logical error per cycle by measuring the logical error probability at ten cycles, decoding with correlated matching28. a, One cycle of the surface code circuit, focusing on one data qubit and one measure qubit. Black bar, CZ; H, Hadamard; M, measure; R, reset; DD, dynamical decoupling; orange, injected coherent errors; purple, DQLR32. b, Error injection in the surface code on a 105-qubit processor. Distance 3 averages over 9 subset codes, and distance 5 averages over 4 subset codes, as shown in Fig. 1. Logical performance is plotted against the mean weight-4 detection probability averaging over all codes, for which increasing the error injection angle α increases the detection probability. Each experiment is ten cycles with 2 × 104 total repetitions. Lines, power-law fits for data points at or below at which the codes cross.

Distance-3 points (red triangles) are averaged over 4 quadrants. Each experiment is 105 repetitions. Curves, exponential fits. QEC, quantum error correction. e, Repeating experiments to assess performance stability, comparing distance 3 and distance 5. Each point represents a sweep of logical performance versus experiment duration, up to 250 cycles. To obtain the data in d and e, a 72-qubit processor is used. In Fig. 2b, we plot the logical error per cycle versus detection probability for the distance-3, distance-5 and distance-7 codes. We find that the three curves cross near a detection probability of 20%, roughly consistent with the crossover regime explored elsewhere17. The inset further shows that detection probability acts as a good proxy for 1/Λ (ref. 33 and Supplementary Information). When fitting power laws below the crossing, we observe approximately 80% of the ideal value (d + 1)/2 predicted by equation (1). We hypothesize that this deviation is caused by excess correlations in the device. Nevertheless, higher-distance codes show a faster reduction in logical error, realizing the characteristic threshold behaviour in situ on a quantum processor. To quantify the impact of correlated errors along with more typical gate errors, we form an error budget. Using the method outlined elsewhere17,37, we estimate the relative contribution of different component errors to 1/Λ. We run simulations based on a detailed model of our 72-qubit processor. The model includes local noise sources due to gates and measurements, as well as two sources of correlated error: leakage, and stray interactions between neighbouring qubits with our CZ gates that can induce correlated ZZ and swap-like errors (Supplementary Information). Figure 2c shows our estimated error budget for 1/Λ in the 72-qubit processor when decoding with correlated matching. Applying the same decoder to experimental data yields Λ = 1.97 ± 0.02. The error budget overpredicts Λ by 14% (Fig. 2c, ‘excess’), indicating that most but not all error effects in our processor have been captured. Leakage and stray interactions make up an estimated 17% of the budget; although not a dominant contributor, we expect their importance to increase as the error rates decrease. Moreover, out-of-model long-range interactions or high-energy leakage might contribute to the error budget discrepancy. Overall, both local and correlated errors from CZ gates are the largest contributors to the error budget. Consequently, continuing to improve both coherence and calibration will be crucial to further reduce logical error. One potential source of excess correlations that we actively mitigate is leakage to higher excited states of our transmon qubits. During the logical qubit operation, we remove leakage from measure qubits using multilevel reset. For data qubits, DQLR swaps leakage excitations to measure qubits (or additional leakage removal qubits)32. To examine sensitivity to leakage, we measure logical error probability of distance-3 and distance-5 codes in our 72-qubit processor with and without DQLR, and the results are shown in Fig. 2d. Although activating DQLR does not strongly affect the distance-3 performance, it substantially boosts the distance-5 performance, resulting in a 35% increase in Λ. Comparatively, the detection probability decreases by only 12% (Supplementary Information), indicating that the detection probability is only a good proxy for logical error suppression if the errors are uncorrelated. Overall, we find that addressing leakage is crucial for operating surface codes with transmon qubits15,32,38. Finally, we test the sensitivity to drift. Using our 72-qubit processor, we measure the logical performance of one distance-5 and four distance-3 codes 16 times over 15 h, and the results are shown in Fig. 2e. Before the repeated runs, we use a frequency optimization strategy that forecasts defect frequencies of two-level systems (TLSs). This helps to avoid qubits coupling to TLSs during the initial calibration as well as for the duration of the experiments. Between every four experimental runs, we recalibrate the processor to account for potential qubit frequency and readout signal drift. We observe an average Λ = 2.18 ± 0.07 (standard deviation) and best Λ = 2.31 ± 0.02 (Supplementary Information) when decoding with the neural network. Although the performance of the worst distance-3 quadrant appears to fluctuate due to a transient TLS moving faster than our forecasts, this fluctuation is suppressed in the distance-5 code, suggesting that larger codes are less sensitive to component-level fluctuations. Moreover, the logical error rates of experiments right after drift recalibration are not appreciably lower than those just prior, indicating that our logical qubit is robust to the levels of qubit frequency and readout drift present. These results indicate that superconducting processors can remain stable for the hours-long timescales required for large-scale fault-tolerant algorithms21.\n\nDespite realizing below-threshold surface codes, orders of magnitude remain between present logical error rates and the requirements for practical quantum computation. In previous work running repetition codes, we found that high-energy impact events occurred approximately once every 10 s, causing large correlated error bursts that manifested a logical error floor of around 10−6 (ref. 17). Such errors would block our ability to run error-corrected algorithms in the future, motivating us to reassess repetition codes on our newer devices. Using our 72-qubit processor, we run 2 × 107 shots of a distance-29 repetition code with 1,000 cycles of error correction, with the shots split evenly between bit- and phase-flip codes. In total, we execute 2 × 1010 cycles of error correction comprising 5.5 h of processor execution time. Given the logical error probability p at 1,000 cycles, we infer the logical error per cycle as \\({\\varepsilon }_{d}=\\frac{1}{2}(1-{(1-2{p}_{{\\rm{L}}})}^{1/1,000})\\). To assess how the logical error per cycle scales with distance d, we follow ref. 37 and subsample lower-distance repetition codes from the distance-29 data. Averaging over bit- and phase-flip repetition codes, we obtain Λ = 8.4 ± 0.1 when fitting logical error per cycle versus code distance between d = 5 and d = 11 (Fig. 3a). Notably, the error per cycle on the 72-qubit processor is suppressed far below 10−6, breaking past the error floor observed previously. We attribute the mitigation of high-energy impact failures to gap-engineered Josephson junctions39. However, at code distances of d ≥ 15, we observe a deviation from exponential error suppression at high distances culminating in an apparent logical error floor of 10−10. Although we do not observe any errors at distance 29, this is probably due to randomly decoding correctly on the few most-damaging error bursts. Although this logical error per cycle might permit certain fault-tolerant applications11, it is still many orders of magnitude higher than expected and precludes larger fault-tolerant circuits12,21. a, ε versus d when decoding with minimum-weight perfect matching. The repetition code points are from d = 29, 103-cycle experiments, 107 repetitions for each basis X and Z. We subsample smaller codes from the same d = 29 dataset, averaging over subsamples. Line, fit of Λ. We include data from ref. 17 for comparison. b, Example event causing elevated detection probabilities, which decay exponentially with time constant 369 ± 6 μs (grey dashed line). Three consecutive experimental shots are plotted, delimited by the vertical grey lines. The 28 measure qubits are divided into four quartiles based on the average detection probability in the grey-shaded window. Each trace represents the detection probability averaged over one quartile and a time window of ten cycles. Roughly half the measure qubits experience an appreciable rise in detection probability. The inset shows the average detection probability for each measure qubit (coloured circle) in the grey-shaded window. c, Logical error scaling with the injected error. We inject a range of coherent errors on all the qubits and plot against the observed mean detection probability p . Each experiment is ten cycles, and we average over 106 repetitions. Smaller code distances are again subsampled from d = 29. Lines, power-law fits \\({\\varepsilon }_{d}={A}_{d}{p}_{\\det }^{(d+1)/2}\\) (one fit parameter, A ), restricted to ε > 10−7 and p < 0.3. d, 1/Λ scaling with the injected error. Typical relative fit uncertainty is 2%. Line, fit; 2.2p . To obtain the data in this figure, a 72-qubit processor is used. When we examine the detection patterns for these high-distance logical failures, we observe two different failure modes (Supplementary Information). The first failure mode manifests as one or two detectors suddenly increasing in the detection probability by more than a factor of 3, settling to their initial detection probability tens or hundreds of cycles later (Supplementary Information). These less-damaging failures could be caused by transient TLSs appearing near the operation frequencies of a qubit, or by coupler excitations, but might be mitigated using methods similar to refs. 38,40. The second and more catastrophic failure mode manifests as many detectors simultaneously experiencing a larger spike in the detection probability; an example is shown in Fig. 3b. Notably, these anisotropic error bursts are spatially localized to neighbourhoods of roughly 30 qubits (Fig. 3b, inset). Over the course of our 2 × 1010 cycles of error correction, our processor experienced six of these large error bursts, which are responsible for the highest-distance failures. These bursts, such as the event shown in Fig. 3b, are different from previously observed high-energy impact events17. They occur approximately once an hour, rather than once every few seconds, and they decay with an exponential time constant of around 400 μs, rather than tens of milliseconds. We do not yet understand the cause of these events, but mitigating them remains vital to building a fault-tolerant quantum computer. These results reaffirm that long repetition codes are a crucial tool for discovering new error mechanisms in quantum processors at the logical noise floor. However, surface codes are larger and sensitive to more errors than repetition codes; therefore, these events may affect the surface code performance differently. Furthermore, although we have tested the scaling law in equation (1) at low distances, repetition codes enable us to scan to higher distances and lower logical errors. Using a similar coherent error injection method as that in the surface code, we show the scaling of logical error versus physical error and code distance in Fig. 3c,d, observing good agreement with O(p(d+1)/2) error suppression. For example, reducing the detection probability by a factor of 2 manifests in reduction by a factor of 250 in logical error at distance 15, consistent with the expected O(p8) scaling. This shows the considerable error suppression that should eventually enable large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers, provided we can reach similar error suppression factors in surface codes.\n\nAlong with a high-fidelity processor, fault-tolerant quantum computing also requires a classical co-processor that can decode errors in real time. This is because some logical operations are non-deterministic; they depend on logical measurement outcomes that must be correctly interpreted on the fly. If the decoder cannot process measurements fast enough, an increasing backlog of syndrome information can cause an exponential increase in computation time23. Real-time decoding is particularly challenging for superconducting processors due to their speed. The throughput of transmitting, processing and decoding the syndrome information in each cycle must keep pace with the fast error-correcting cycle time of 1.1 μs. Using our 72-qubit processor as a platform, we demonstrate below-threshold performance alongside this vital module in the fault-tolerant quantum computing stack. Our decoding system begins with our classical control electronics, where the measurement signals are classified into bits and then transmitted to a specialized workstation using low-latency Ethernet. Inside the workstation, measurements are converted into detections and then streamed to the real-time decoding software using a shared memory buffer. We use the sparse blossom algorithm41, which is optimized to quickly resolve the local configurations of errors common in surface code decoding, using a parallelization strategy similar to that in ref. 42. The decoder operates on a constant-sized graph buffer that emulates the section of the error graph being decoded at any instant, but does not grow with the total number of cycles used in the experiment. Different threads are responsible for different spacetime regions of the graph, processing their requisite syndrome information as it is streamed in42,43,44,45. These results are fused until a global minimum-weight perfect matching is found. The streaming decoding algorithm is illustrated in Fig. 4a,b. We also use a greedy edge reweighting strategy to increase the accuracy by accounting for correlations induced by Y-type errors28,46. a, Schematic of the streaming decoding algorithm. The decoding problems are subdivided into blocks, with different threads responsible for different blocks. b, Task graph for processing blocks. Detections are enabled to match to the block boundaries, which will then be processed downstream during a fuse step. If a configuration of detection events cannot be resolved by a future fuse step, the decoder heralds failure. We use ten-cycle blocks to ensure that the heralded failure rate is negligible compared with the logical failure rate. c, Decoder latency versus experiment duration. Each blue point corresponds to a latency measurement for a full shot (ten shots per duration; horizontal bar, median; blue shading, violin plot). The yellow histograms represent fine-grained latency measurements of the time between receiving data and completing decoding for each ten-cycle block in a shot. The values from these fine-grained measurements, which we refer to as subshot latencies, tend to be slightly larger than those from full-shot latency measurements as the decoder may need to wait to fuse with detection events in future cycles. Infrequently, we see brief subshot latency spikes above 1 ms (Supplementary Information). d, Accuracy comparison for the surface code with three decoders. We include the real-time decoder (RT), ensembled matching synthesis (Ens.) and the neural network decoder (NN). Uncertainty on each point is less than 4 × 10−4 (Supplementary Information). To obtain the data in this figure, a 72-qubit processor is used. In Fig. 4c, we report the decoder latency, which we define as the time between the decoding software receiving the final cycle of syndrome measurements and the time at which the decoder returns its correction. For our distance-5 surface code, we test different problem sizes by increasing the number of error correction cycles up to 106. We observe that the average decoder latency remains roughly constant at a net average of 63 ± 17 μs independent of the length of the experiment (up to 1.1 s), indicating that the decoding problem is being processed in real time. This latency will eventually lower bound the reaction time of the logical processor when enacting non-Clifford gates. Other contributions to the reaction time include the data transmission time (which we estimate to be less than 10 μs) and feedback (which we have not yet implemented). Moreover, our decoder latency scales with the code size, underscoring the need for further optimization. Importantly, we are able to maintain below-threshold performance even under the strict timing requirements imposed by real-time decoding. We run a dedicated experiment on our 72-qubit processor to compare real-time decoding to high-accuracy offline neural network decoding of the same data, with the results shown in Fig. 4d. Our real-time decoder achieves ε = 0.35% ± 0.01% and Λ = 2.0 ± 0.1 using a device-data-independent prior. Meanwhile, the neural network decoder achieves ε = 0.269% ± 0.008% and Λ = 2.18 ± 0.09 when later decoding offline. The modest reduction in accuracy when comparing the real-time decoder with an offline decoder is expected as the real-time decoder must operate substantially faster. It requires a throughput of less than 1.1 μs per cycle compared with the 24 μs per cycle of the neural network26. However, we expect that many of our high-accuracy decoding methods can eventually be made real time by introducing techniques like layered or windowed decoding27,43,44.\n\nIn this work, we have demonstrated surface code memory below the threshold in our new Willow architecture. Each time the code distance increases by two, the logical error per cycle is reduced by more than half, culminating in a distance-7 logical lifetime of more than double its best constituent physical qubit lifetime. This signature of exponential logical error suppression with code distance forms the foundation of running large-scale quantum algorithms with error correction. Our error-corrected processors also demonstrate other key advances towards fault-tolerant quantum computing. We achieve repeatable performance for more than several hours and run experiments up to 106 cycles without deteriorating performance, both of which are necessary for future large-scale fault-tolerant algorithms. Furthermore, we have engineered a real-time decoding system with only a modest reduction in accuracy compared with our offline decoders. Even so, many challenges remain ahead of us. Although we might, in principle, achieve low logical error rates by scaling up our current processors, it would be resource intensive in practice. Extrapolating the projections shown in Fig. 1d, achieving a 10−6 error rate would require a distance-27 logical qubit using 1,457 physical qubits. Scaling up will bring additional challenges in real-time decoding as the syndrome measurements per cycle increase quadratically with the code distance. Our repetition code experiments also identify a noise floor at an error rate of 10−10 caused by correlated bursts of errors. Identifying and mitigating this error mechanism will be integral to running larger quantum algorithms. However, quantum error correction also provides us exponential leverage in reducing logical errors with processor improvements. For example, reducing physical error rates by a factor of two would improve the distance-27 logical performance by four orders of magnitude, well into algorithmically relevant error rates11,12. We further expect these overheads to reduce with advances in error correction protocols47,48,49,50,51,52,53 and decoding54,55,56. The purpose of quantum error correction is to enable large-scale quantum algorithms. Although this work focuses on building a robust memory, additional challenges will arise in logical computation57,58. On the classical side, we must ensure that software elements including our calibration protocols, real-time decoders and logical compilers can scale to the sizes and complexities needed to run multiple surface code operations59. With below-threshold surface codes, we have demonstrated processor performance that can scale in principle, but which we must now scale in practice."

        "document": "Quantum computing is taking the tech world by storm. This field uses quantum mechanics to process information in ways far beyond the capabilities of classical computers. Unlike traditional systems that use binary bits, quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in multiple states at the same time due to superposition and entanglement. The result is breakthroughs in areas like quantum cryptography, drug discovery, and materials science. All that said, quantum computing faces major challenges that hinder its practical implementation. Qubits are highly sensitive to environmental noise, temperature fluctuations, and electromagnetic interference, leading to errors in computation. As these errors accumulate, it becomes difficult to maintain accuracy.\n\nQuantum error correction, or quantum computing error correction, is a set of techniques for protecting quantum information from errors that are caused by noise and decoherence. While classical error correction deals with 1s or 0s, QEC involves qubits that exist in superpositions. This makes it a challenging yet key aspect of quantum computing. A common method of QEC is using multiple physical qubits to encode a logical qubit. Entangling these qubits helps detect and correct quantum errors without having to directly measure the qubits’ states. QEC Codes, like the Shor code, are examples of schemes that apply these techniques and can correct various types of errors. There are two classes of error correction codes: surface and stabilizer.\n• Surface codes: refer to two-dimensional lattices of physical qubits that create logical qubits with topological protection. Errors can happen through the lattice without affecting the logical qubit’s global state.\n• ‍Stabilizer codes: detect errors using measurements and apply error correction to corrupted qubits using classical logic. Examples of this class include the Shor code and Steane code.\\\n\nBit-flip error correction takes on errors where a qubit’s state changes from ∣0⟩ to ∣1⟩ or the other way around. This type of error is similar to flipping a binary bit in classical computing. QEC codes detect and fix this error by encoding a logical qubit across multiple physical qubits and measuring parity checks. Phase-flip error correction deals with errors in the relative phase of a qubit’s state, where the phase in a superposition state like ∣+⟩=∣0⟩+∣1⟩ changes. This kind of error is unique to quantum computing systems and can’t be directly measured without collapsing the state. To detect and correct phase-flip errors, the phase information is encoded redundantly across multiple qubits. Bit-phase flip error correction handles errors that simultaneously affect a qubit’s value (bit-flip) and its phase. This combined error is corrected by integrating the methods of both bit-flip and phase-flip corrections. Advanced quantum error-correcting codes, such as the Shor code, are designed to correct bit-phase flip errors by encoding the logical qubit in a way that protects it from all common types of quantum errors. Qubits are naturally prone to errors like bit-flips and phase-flips due to their fragile quantum states. Without QEC, these errors can accumulate quickly, making quantum computations unreliable. QEC allows quantum systems to pinpoint and correct errors without directly measuring qubit states. By encoding logical qubits across multiple physical qubits, QEC protects information and extends the coherence time of computations. This makes QEC key to achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing—a crucial step toward solving complex problems in fields like cryptography, optimization, and material science. Why Is Quantum Error Correction so Difficult to Implement? Quantum error correction calls for a great deal of redundancy, often relying on hundreds of physical qubits to encode a single logical qubit. Since current hardware struggles to provide enough stable qubits, this overhead makes scaling quantum systems challenging. The need for extensive error correction layers also complicates quantum computing, limiting the practicality of early quantum devices. Developing efficient codes that reduce redundancy without compromising error protection is a major challenge. Qubits are highly sensitive to environmental factors like temperature, electromagnetic interference, and mechanical vibrations. This increases the likelihood of errors during computation and even while performing error correction. Maintaining the delicate quantum state calls for advanced isolation methods and near-perfect control over the system. Dealing with this challenge involves improving qubit stability to minimize the impact of noise and decoherence. While QEC aims to fix errors, the correction process itself can introduce new ones if the operations aren’t accurate. Faulty gates, inaccurate measurements, or timing delays during error detection can create errors instead of fixing them. Building hardware and software systems that can carry out error correction accurately without adding noise is a key challenge for reliable quantum computing. QEC involves complex algorithms, such as stabilizer or surface codes, which require entanglement, precise measurements, and feedback mechanisms. These call for highly sophisticated quantum control systems, which are tricky to design and apply. On top of that, making sure that error correction works hand-in-hand with quantum computations requires advancements in both hardware and algorithm development. Achieving fault-tolerant quantum systems—where errors are corrected without interrupting computations—is challenging to say the least. This involves not only implementing QEC but also coordinating it across a large-scale quantum processor. Moreover, optimizing the interplay between error correction, hardware constraints, and algorithm efficiency requires breakthroughs in qubit design, control systems, and computational frameworks.\n\nGoogle is a major player in advanced quantum error correction, focusing on the surface code in particular. The company has reached significant milestones, such as reducing error rates in its Sycamore processor and applying error suppression techniques that scale as more qubits are added. Google’s ultimate goal is to achieve logical qubits with error rates lower than physical qubits—a huge leap toward fault-tolerant quantum computing. Microsoft is taking a unique approach to QEC through topological qubits, which rely on exotic quantum states to encode information. Although the topological qubit is still experimental, Microsoft’s Azure Quantum platform integrates existing QEC algorithms to provide stable quantum operations. By combining hardware innovations with its software ecosystem, the tech giant aims to create scalable, error-resilient quantum systems. IBM is working on improving error correction with heavy-hexagonal lattices, an optimized layout for qubits that reduces crosstalk and improves coherence times. This design makes it possible to surface codes for error detection. The company has presented a working logical qubit with lower error rates, a significant milestone toward fault tolerance. IBM’s Quantum System One has the capacity to integrate advanced QEC protocols, supporting its plan to achieve quantum advantage by 2026. NVIDIA’s contribution to QEC involves developing GPU-based quantum emulators, which simulate quantum systems at scale. These emulators are used to test and optimize error correction codes before deploying them on physical quantum hardware. NVIDIA focuses on allowing researchers to refine QEC algorithms efficiently, bridging the gap between theoretical models and hardware implementation. Intel is pioneering the application of silicon spin qubits, which use existing semiconductor manufacturing technologies for scalable quantum systems. These qubits tend to be smaller and more stable, reducing noise and improving error rates. Intel combines these hardware advancements with machine learning algorithms to optimize error correction protocols. The company’s holistic approach integrates hardware and software for QEC with the aim of making quantum computing more practical. Amazon is using its Braket platform to develop hybrid quantum-classical solutions for QEC. By integrating quantum processors with powerful classical systems, Amazon allows for error detection and correction simulations in real-time. The company is also collaborating with researchers to optimize error-correcting codes for scalability. Amazon’s approach is all about accessibility; it offers tools for developers to experiment with QEC without the need for direct access to physical quantum hardware. Needless to say, quantum computing is making ripples in the tech scene. BlueQubit is at the forefront of this revolution with its QSaaS (Quantum Software as a Service) platform. The company is breaking down barriers linked with quantum computing, such as high costs, hardware limitations, and, of course, error correction challenges. By integrating emulators, user-friendly tools, and quantum processing units (QPUs), BlueQubit allows businesses and researchers to benefit from quantum computing without the need for infrastructure. With BlueQubit, users can work with real-world quantum computing applications, be it financial modeling, materials science, or even drug discovery. The platform takes away the technical challenges to make quantum computing accessible to a wider audience. There’s no denying that quantum computing has a bright future ahead. As we continue to see major breakthroughs in error correction and scalability, the technology is bound to redefine industries and solve some of humanity's most complex challenges. Thanks to innovators like BlueQubit, the potential of quantum computing is becoming a tangible reality today."

        "document": "Quantum computing stands at the forefront of technological innovation, offering the tantalizing promise of revolutionizing how we process information. By leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics, quantum computers could solve complex problems far beyond the reach of classical computers. However, despite its immense potential, realizing the full capabilities of quantum computing is fraught with significant challenges.\n\nQuantum computing is a type of computing that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process information. Unlike classical computers, which use bits that represent either a 0 or a 1, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can represent both 0 and 1 simultaneously, thanks to a property called superposition. They can also be entangled, meaning the state of one qubit can depend on the state of another, no matter the distance between them. This allows quantum computers to perform many calculations at once, potentially solving certain complex problems much faster than classical computers. While still in the experimental stage, quantum computing holds promise for advancements in cryptography, material science, and complex system simulations.\n\nQuantum computing holds the promise of revolutionizing various fields by leveraging the unique properties of qubits, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform complex computations exponentially faster than classical computers. This technological leap could transform cryptography by breaking currently unbreakable codes, advance material science through accurate simulations of molecular structures, and solve optimization problems in logistics and supply chains with unprecedented efficiency. Additionally, quantum computing could enhance artificial intelligence by rapidly processing vast datasets, leading to more sophisticated and intelligent systems. In essence, quantum computing has the potential to address some of the most challenging problems in science, industry, and beyond, unlocking new frontiers of innovation and discovery.\n\nDespite these promising prospects, several formidable obstacles stand in the way of practical quantum computing:\n• Qubit Stability: Qubits are highly sensitive to their environment. Even the slightest interference from external factors, known as decoherence, can cause qubits to lose their quantum state. Maintaining qubit stability long enough to perform meaningful computations is a major hurdle.\n• Error Correction: Due to their delicate nature, qubits are prone to errors. Developing effective quantum error correction methods is crucial to ensure reliable computation. Current error rates are too high for practical use, and creating a system that can correct these errors without requiring an impractically large number of qubits is an ongoing challenge.\n• Scalability: Building a quantum computer with a sufficient number of qubits to tackle real-world problems is an enormous engineering challenge.

Researchers are still exploring the best ways to apply quantum principles to solve practical problems.\n\nGiven these challenges, there are no guarantees that we will ever fully realize the potential of quantum computing. Significant scientific and engineering breakthroughs are needed to overcome these obstacles. Nevertheless, the pursuit of quantum computing continues to drive innovation and inspire researchers worldwide. In conclusion, while quantum computing holds immense promise, it also faces substantial challenges that must be addressed. The journey towards practical quantum computing is uncertain and complex, but the potential rewards make it a compelling area of exploration. Whether or not we achieve its full potential, the pursuit of quantum computing will undoubtedly lead to new discoveries and advancements in our understanding of the quantum world.

        "document": "Quantum Computing in 2024: Breakthroughs, Challenges, and What Lies Ahead\n\nQuantum computing (QC), once a theoretical concept confined to academic research, has rapidly evolved into one of the most exciting and promising fields in technology. As we move through 2024, QC is inching closer to practical applications that could revolutionize industries from cryptography to drug discovery. However, alongside these breakthroughs come significant challenges that must be addressed before quantum computing can reach its full potential. Let’s explore the latest developments in quantum computing, the obstacles that remain, and what the future may hold for this transformative technology.\n\n2024 has been a year of significant progress in the field of QC, with several key breakthroughs that are bringing us closer to realizing its potential:\n\n1. Increased Qubit Stability and Error Correction\n\n One of the most critical challenges in quantum computing has always been maintaining the stability of qubits—the basic units of quantum information. In 2024, researchers have made notable advancements in error correction techniques, which are essential for stabilizing qubits and reducing the errors that occur during quantum computations. Improved error correction codes and the development of more stable qubits, such as topological qubits, have pushed the boundaries of what is possible, bringing us closer to achieving reliable quantum computing.\n\n2. Quantum Supremacy Milestones\n\n Quantum supremacy—the point at which a quantum computer can solve a problem that classical computers cannot—has been a hot topic in recent years. In 2024, several QC firms and research institutions have announced new milestones in this area. While there is still debate over what constitutes true quantum supremacy, the latest demonstrations have shown quantum computers tackling increasingly complex problems, outpacing their classical counterparts in specific tasks such as complex simulations and optimization problems.\n\n3. Advancements in Quantum Algorithms\n\n The development of quantum algorithms has seen significant progress in 2024. New algorithms designed to take advantage of quantum computing’s unique capabilities are being developed, offering the potential to solve problems in fields such as cryptography, materials science, and machine learning more efficiently than ever before. For instance, advances in quantum algorithms for factoring large numbers have implications for breaking traditional encryption methods, a development that could reshape the field of cybersecurity.\n\n4. Commercial Quantum Cloud Services\n\n Quantum computing is gradually becoming more accessible, thanks to the expansion of quantum cloud services offered by tech giants such as IBM, Google, and Amazon. In 2024, these platforms have introduced more powerful quantum processors, allowing businesses and researchers to experiment with QC without needing to build and maintain their own quantum hardware. These services are making it easier for organizations to explore quantum computing applications in a real-world context, accelerating innovation across industries.\n\nDespite these exciting breakthroughs, significant challenges remain before quantum computing can be fully realized and integrated into everyday use:\n\n1. Scalability Issues\n\n While qubit stability has improved, scaling quantum computers to the level necessary for solving large, complex problems remains a daunting challenge. Building quantum computers with millions of qubits that can operate reliably in tandem is still beyond our current capabilities. As researchers work to overcome these scalability issues, the goal of creating large-scale quantum computers remains on the horizon.\n\n2. Quantum Error Correction\n\n Although error correction has improved, it is not yet at the level required for fully fault-tolerant QC. Quantum systems are inherently susceptible to noise and decoherence, which can introduce errors into computations. Developing more efficient and effective error correction methods is essential for the future of quantum computing, and remains an active area of research in 2024.\n\n3. Hardware Limitations\n\n The physical construction of quantum computers presents significant engineering challenges. Quantum processors need to operate at extremely low temperatures, close to absolute zero, and are highly sensitive to environmental disturbances. Maintaining the delicate balance required for quantum operations is difficult, and building robust, reliable quantum hardware that can function outside of highly controlled laboratory environments is still a major hurdle.\n\n4. Security Concerns\n\n The potential of QC to break current cryptographic systems is both a promise and a threat. As quantum computers become more powerful, they could render many of the encryption methods that secure today’s digital communications obsolete. This has led to a race to develop quantum-resistant cryptography, but widespread adoption is still years away. The looming threat of quantum-enabled cyberattacks is a significant concern for governments and industries worldwide.\n\n5. High Costs and Accessibility\n\n Quantum computing technology remains expensive, and the expertise required to work with quantum systems is still relatively rare. This limits access to QC for many businesses and researchers, particularly smaller organizations without the resources to invest in cutting-edge technology. While quantum cloud services are helping to bridge this gap, the costs and complexity of quantum computing remain barriers to widespread adoption.\n\nAs we look to the future, the road ahead for quantum computing is both challenging and full of potential. Here are some key developments to watch for in the coming years:\n\n1. Quantum-Classical Hybrid Systems\n\n One of the most promising directions for QC is the development of quantum-classical hybrid systems. These systems combine the strengths of classical computing with the unique capabilities of quantum processors, allowing for more efficient problem-solving. In the near term, we are likely to see more hybrid approaches that leverage quantum computing for specific tasks while relying on classical computing for others.\n\n2. Quantum Networking and the Quantum Internet\n\n Quantum networking, which involves connecting quantum computers over long distances, is an emerging field with the potential to revolutionize communication and data sharing. The concept of a quantum internet, where quantum information is transmitted securely over vast distances, is still in its early stages but could become a reality within the next decade. This would open up new possibilities for secure communication, distributed quantum computing, and more.\n\n3. Wider Industry Adoption\n\n As quantum computing technology matures and becomes more accessible, we can expect to see broader adoption across various industries. Sectors such as finance, healthcare, energy, and logistics are likely to be early adopters, using QC to optimize processes, develop new materials, and solve complex logistical challenges. The potential applications are vast, and as businesses begin to see tangible benefits from QC, its adoption will accelerate.\n\n4. Ongoing Research and Development\n\n The future of QC will be shaped by ongoing research and development efforts. Governments, academic institutions, and private companies are investing heavily in quantum research, with the goal of overcoming current challenges and unlocking the full potential of this technology. As breakthroughs continue to occur, we will move closer to the realization of quantum computing’s promise.\n\nAs we look ahead, the continued advancement of quantum computing will depend on the collaboration between researchers, engineers, and businesses. The journey to fully functional QC is still in its early stages, but the progress made in 2024 demonstrates that the quantum revolution is well underway. By staying informed and engaged with the developments in this field, businesses and individuals alike can prepare for the transformative impact that quantum computing is set to have on the world."

        "document": "Quantum computers are currently error-ridden machines, greatly limiting practical applications. In a study published today in Nature, researchers at Google and their colleagues reveal they have, for the first time, developed a quantum processor that can reliably fix errors faster that it generates them.\n\nThe qubits at the heart of quantum computers are very error-prone pieces of technology. Currently, quantum computers typically suffer roughly one error every thousand operations, far short of the one-in-10-billion error rates needed for the machines to run long enough for many practical applications, the new study notes.\n\nScientists often hope to compensate for these high error rates by . These quantum error correction strategies would help quantum computers detect and correct mistakes, so that a cluster of “physical” qubits can altogether behave as one low-error “logical” qubit, serving as the foundation of a .\n\n“Quantum error correction is the path towards large-scale quantum applications, including things like drug discovery, material design, improved optimization, and so on,” says Kevin Satzinger, a research scientist at Google Quantum AI. “Think better pharmaceuticals or better batteries.”\n\n“When I first saw the error rate go down, and go down dramatically, that was the first time I thought to myself, ‘Damn, this is really going to work.’” —Michael Newman, Google\n\nHowever, quantum error correction schemes are not foolproof. Each quantum error correction strategy is only useful if the hardware’s error rates are low enough to benefit from it. This error threshold depends on the specific strategy and the nature of the errors. Above that critical threshold, adding more qubits will only increase, not decrease, the number of errors.\n\n“Quantum error correction has been around for about 30 years, and fundamental to it working is the idea that more error correction should lead to better error rates,” says Michael Newman, a research Scientist at Google Quantum AI. “But this hasn’t been the case until now.”\n\nOne of the most popular quantum error correction schemes that scientists are exploring is called the , in which qubits are arranged in a two-dimensional checkerboard pattern; units of information are encoded into sections of this lattice. It offers an error threshold of roughly .\n\nGoogle’s new quantum processor reduces its error rates as more qubits are added.Google Quantum AI\n\nNow scientists at Google Quantum AI and their colleagues have developed a new quantum computer architecture called Willow that is capable of quantum error correction below the surface code’s error threshold.\n\nIn the new study, the researchers executed surface codes on two Willow quantum processors. One used 72 superconducting transmon qubits—which are less sensitive to the electric charges that can cause qubits to lose their quantum properties, making them useless—and the other 105.\n\nThe scientists found their 105-qubit grid experienced an error rate of roughly 0.143 percent per cycle of error correction, an error rate about half that of the 72-qubit grid. In other words, for the first time, adding more physical qubits to a quantum processor actually reduced error rates, just as one would hope would happen with quantum error correction.\n\n“I’ve always been a believer in quantum error correction, but it’s different to believe something than to see it happen,” Newman says. “When I first saw the error rate go down, and go down dramatically, that was the first time I thought to myself, ‘Damn, this is really going to work.’”\n\nIn addition, the 105-qubit processor is the first qubit array to have a longer lifetime than its individual physical qubits, lasting more than twice as long as its best physical qubit. This helps show that quantum error correction is improving the system overall, the researchers say.\n\nIn order to achieve practical applications, quantum computers have to correct errors before they finish their quantum computations. The scientists note their new processors are capable of essentially performing quantum error correction mid-computation, with error-correcting cycle times 1.1 microseconds long. In addition, tests performed over the course of 15 hours suggest these processors could remain stable over the long timescales needed for large-scale fault-tolerant quantum algorithms.\n\n“We have built a system that can scale in principle, but which we must now scale in practice.” —Kevin Satzinger, Google\n\nTo estimate Willow’s performance, the researchers used a benchmark called random circuit sampling. Although it has no known real-world applications, the researchers note this benchmark is the most difficult task for a classical computer that can also be done on a quantum computer today. They found the 105-qubit Willow processor could perform a benchmark computation in under five minutes that would take today’s fastest supercomputer 10 septillion (or 1025) years, a time that vastly exceeds the age of the universe. (This benchmark is the same one Google used in 2019 to claim that one of its quantum computers was the first to show quantum supremacy.)\n\nThe research team attributes these advances to a number of upgrades, such as better fabrication techniques and the use of neural networks to account for device noise. This in turn led to a host of improvements, such as the ability for the qubits to stay in superposition for nearly 100 microseconds, roughly five times better than Google’s previous generation of quantum processors, Sycamore.\n\nIn the future, the researchers would like to show their quantum-error-corrected systems actually performing a quantum computation, Satzinger says. However, he cautions that their research is still a long way from large-scale quantum applications—they still need to scale their system up to many thousands of qubits, and to further improve the error rates of their hardware. “We have built a system that can scale in principle, but which we must now scale in practice,” Satzinger says."

By leveraging the unique properties of quantum computing, QML has the potential to solve complex problems exponentially faster than classical methods, enabling breakthroughs in areas such as optimization, data analysis, and drug discovery. In this blog post, we’ll explore what Quantum Machine Learning is, how it works, and why it’s considered the next frontier in AI.\n\nQuantum Machine Learning (QML) is the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning, where quantum algorithms are applied to enhance and accelerate traditional ML tasks. While classical machine learning relies on classical computers, QML leverages quantum computers to process and analyze data more efficiently, especially when dealing with large-scale or complex datasets. The unique advantages of QML come from the principles of quantum mechanics — such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum parallelism — which allow quantum computers to perform computations in ways that classical computers cannot.\n• Qubits: The basic unit of quantum information. Unlike classical bits (which can be either 0 or 1), qubits can exist in both 0 and 1 simultaneously due to superposition.\n• Superposition: A quantum property that allows qubits to exist in multiple states at once, enabling parallel computations.\n• Entanglement: A quantum phenomenon where the states of two qubits become correlated, meaning the state of one qubit directly influences the state of another, no matter the distance.\n• Quantum Parallelism: The ability of quantum computers to perform many calculations simultaneously, exponentially increasing computational speed for certain tasks.\n\nOne of the most significant advantages of QML is its potential to solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. For example, tasks that require complex matrix calculations or involve searching through large datasets can be performed in parallel by quantum computers, drastically reducing computational time. Example: Quantum versions of algorithms like Grover’s algorithm provide quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems, while Shor’s algorithm offers exponential speedup for factoring large numbers — an essential task in cryptography and data security. QML is particularly well-suited for processing high-dimensional data, such as those found in image recognition, genomics, and drug discovery. Quantum computers can represent large amounts of data with fewer qubits, allowing them to analyze complex datasets more efficiently. Example: Quantum kernel methods enable the classification of data in higher dimensions with fewer computational resources, improving the accuracy and speed of tasks like image classification or anomaly detection. Many machine learning tasks involve optimizing a model’s parameters to minimize error or maximize accuracy. Quantum optimization algorithms like QAOA allow QML to find optimal solutions to complex optimization problems much faster than classical methods. Example: In finance, QML can optimize portfolios by analyzing multiple assets and market conditions simultaneously, making real-time adjustments to maximize returns and minimize risk.\n\nQuantum Machine Learning is still in its infancy, but it holds great potential in a wide range of industries. Below are some real-world applications where QML is poised to make an impact. In the pharmaceutical industry, discovering new drugs involves sifting through enormous datasets of molecular structures and simulating complex chemical interactions. QML can dramatically speed up this process by quickly identifying promising drug candidates, simulating chemical reactions, and optimizing molecular structures.\n• Molecular Simulations: Quantum algorithms like VQE can simulate molecular energy states more accurately than classical computers, allowing researchers to better understand how drugs will interact with specific proteins, leading to faster drug discovery. Quantum Machine Learning is revolutionizing the financial sector by enabling more efficient portfolio optimization, fraud detection, and risk analysis. By processing vast amounts of financial data in parallel, QML algorithms can optimize investment strategies in real time.\n• Risk Assessment: Quantum computers can analyze complex financial models and perform stress tests on investment portfolios, predicting potential losses in different economic scenarios and optimizing asset allocation accordingly. In logistics and supply chain management, optimizing delivery routes, managing inventory, and reducing costs require solving complex optimization problems. QML can streamline these processes by finding optimal solutions to routing, scheduling, and distribution challenges.\n• Route Optimization: Quantum optimization algorithms can determine the most efficient delivery routes for trucks, minimizing fuel costs and travel time, even in scenarios with thousands of potential routes and variables. Quantum Machine Learning can improve the performance of AI models used for tasks like natural language processing (NLP), image recognition, and recommendation systems. Quantum-enhanced models can better understand context, analyze large text corpora, and improve personalization.\n• Quantum NLP: Quantum computers can enhance NLP models by quickly processing and analyzing the context of words in a sentence, leading to more accurate language translation, sentiment analysis, and text generation. Quantum Machine Learning is expected to play a major role in cryptography by enhancing data encryption techniques and providing more secure communication systems. At the same time, QML could help design quantum-resistant algorithms to counteract the threat posed by quantum computers to classical encryption methods.\n• Post-Quantum Cryptography: QML can help design encryption systems that are resistant to quantum attacks, ensuring the security of sensitive data in the quantum era.\n\nWhile Quantum Machine Learning holds immense promise, there are several challenges that need to be addressed: Currently, quantum computers are in the NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) era, meaning they are still prone to errors and have limited qubit counts. These limitations make it difficult to scale QML algorithms to handle real-world problems at a large scale. Quantum algorithms for machine learning are still in the early stages of development. Researchers are exploring how best to adapt classical ML techniques for quantum computers, and much work remains to be done in optimizing these algorithms for practical use. One of the biggest hurdles in QML is efficiently encoding large amounts of classical data into quantum states. As data grows larger and more complex, finding scalable and efficient encoding methods will be critical to the success of QML. Since current quantum computers are not powerful enough to handle all machine learning tasks, most QML implementations rely on hybrid quantum-classical systems. While hybrid models have shown promise, integrating quantum and classical components seamlessly is still a technical challenge."

With over $2 billion raised by companies in 2024 alone, and over 150 new startups in the past five years, quantum computing is no longer restricted to ‘the lab’.\n\nThe United Nations proclaimed 2025 as the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology (IYQ), and as we march toward the end of the first quarter, the old maxim that quantum computing is still a decade (or two, or three) away is no longer relevant in today’s world. Governments, commercial enterprises and scientific organizations all stand to benefit from quantum computers, led by those built by Quantinuum.\n\nThat is because, amid the flurry of headlines and social media chatter filled with aspirational statements of future ambitions shared by those in the heat of this race, we at Quantinuum continue to lead by example. We demonstrate what that future looks like today, rather than relying solely on slide deck presentations.\n\nOur quantum computers are the most powerful systems in the world. Our H2 system, the only quantum computer that cannot be classically simulated, is years ahead of any other system being developed today. In the coming months, we’ll introduce our customers to Helios, a trillion times more powerful than H2, further extending our lead beyond where the competition is still only planning to be.\n\nAt Quantinuum, we have been convinced for years that the impact of quantum computers on the real world will happen earlier than anticipated. However, we have known that impact will be when powerful quantum computers and powerful classical systems work together.\n\nThis sort of hybrid ‘supercomputer’ has been referenced a few times in the past few months, and there is, rightly, a sense of excitement about what such an accelerated quantum supercomputer could achieve.\n\nThe Power of Hybrid Quantum and Classical Compute\n\nIn a revolutionary move on March 18th, 2025, at the GTC AI conference, NVIDIA announced the opening of a world-class accelerated quantum research center with Quantinuum selected as a key founding collaborator to work on projects with NVIDIA at the center.\n\nWith details shared in an accompanying press statement and blog post, the NVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center (NVAQC) being built in Boston, Massachusetts, will integrate quantum computers with AI supercomputers to ultimately explore how to build accelerated quantum supercomputers capable of solving some of the world’s most challenging problems. The center will begin operations later this year.\n\nAs shared in Quantinuum’s accompanying statement, the center will draw on the NVIDIA CUDA-Q platform, alongside a NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 system containing 576 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs dedicated to quantum research.\n\nThe Role of CUDA-Q in Quantum-Classical Integration\n\nIntegrating quantum and classical hardware relies on a platform that can allow researchers and developers to quickly shift context between these two disparate computing paradigms within a single application. NVIDIA CUDA-Q platform will be the entry-point for researchers to exploit the NVAQC quantum-classical integration.\n\nIn 2022, Quantinuum became the first company to bring CUDA-Q to its quantum systems, establishing a pioneering collaboration that continues to today. Users of CUDA-Q are currently offered access to Quantinuum’s System H1 QPU and emulator for 90 days.\n\nQuantinuum’s future systems will continue to support the CUDA-Q platform. Furthermore, Quantinuum and NVIDIA are committed to evolving and improving tools for quantum classical integration to take advantage of the latest hardware features, for example, on our upcoming Helios generation.\n\nA few weeks ago, we disclosed high level details about an AI system that we refer to as Generative Quantum AI, or GenQAI.

To achieve these advances, we integrate the best CPU and GPU technologies alongside our quantum innovations. Our long-standing collaboration with NVIDIA drives these advancements forward and will be further enriched by the NVAQC.\n\nHere are a couple of examples:\n\nIn quantum error correction, error syndromes detected by measuring \"ancilla\" qubits are sent to a \"decoder.\" The decoder analyzes this information to determine if any corrections are needed. These complex algorithms must be processed quickly and with low latency, requiring advanced CPU and GPU power to calculate and apply corrections keeping logical qubits error-free. Quantinuum has been collaborating with NVIDIA on the development of customized GPU-based decoders which can be coupled with our upcoming Helios system.\n\nIn our application space, we recently announced the integration of InQuanto v4.0, the latest version of Quantinuum’s cutting edge computational chemistry platform, with NVIDIA cuQuantum SDK to enable previously inaccessible tensor-network-based methods for large-scale and high-precision quantum chemistry simulations.\n\nOur work with NVIDIA underscores the partnership between quantum computers and classical processors to maximize the speed toward scaled quantum computers. These systems offer error-corrected qubits for operations that accelerate scientific discovery across a wide range of fields, including drug discovery and delivery, financial market applications, and essential condensed matter physics, such as high-temperature superconductivity.\n\nWe look forward to sharing details with our partners and bringing meaningful scientific discovery to generate economic growth and sustainable development for all of humankind."
