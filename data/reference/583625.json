Here's what I figured out.\n\nNow, the solution in the link you provided further details the optimal strategy is walking on path in such a way that one changes directions only once. In that manner, one is able to cover a range with left and right endpoints, which and seems to represent.\n\nAs to the particulars of the loops, instead of thinking of the loop in terms of the loop variables(i.e. ) it is easier to figure out what changes through the course of the loop, and how is used. Otherwise, figuring out what is in those min and max expressions seems a bit too peculiar in the beginning.\n\nFor instance, in the first loop, instead of figuring out what that range represents, try how is affected by different values gets. After a bit of thinking, one notices that changes in a manner complying to the possible left endpoints.\n\nSpecifically, when , left endpoint is the starting index(i.e. ) and when is , then it is either 0(i.e. if ) or . In the former case, that is as far as the left endpoint can go, as it would get out of the valid range of spots on the road. In the latter case, the number of moves prohibit any solution with a smaller than since it is impossible to go from to those indices in m moves.\n\nThe assignment made to in the first loop can be explained similarly. min statement includes , which is the rightmost legal index that can be reached and it serves to keep the right endpoint in the allowed limits. The inner max statement features , as it is the least possible value for . (i.e. due to being the starting point) It also has an expression . This expression represents the following process:\n• Go to left for p moves.\n• Change direction, and go to right for p moves to reach the starting point.\n• Go to right with the remaining moves.\n\nThe second loop is just the reflection of this first loop, and you may explain it simply by adapting my explanation of the first loop.\n\nAs to your second question, I do not think it is common practice to shift the indices for prefix sum arrays. I typically use this method in online programming contests and my implementation of the prefix sum array you use in Python would be as follows.\n\nThe fundamental idea behind the implementation above is that, at , we have the sum ."

        "document": "Greetings! Remember where we left off? We had just wrapped up the Counting Elements lesson with a neat little task called Missing Integer. A new step ahead for us, as we dive into another lesson — Prefix Sums. Its first task presents itself as an easy starter: Passing Cars.\n\nThe task: We’re given a non-empty array of N integers. More specifically, just 1s and 0s. These elements represent cars that move on some imaginary road. The 1s represent cars moving east, while the 0s represent — yup, you guessed it — cars moving west. Our goal is to count passing cars. To define “passing cars”, we should refer to a pair of cars, say P and Q, such that P < Q, where P is 0 and Q is 1. In other words, a pair of passing cars is a pair of cars moving towards each other. The task wants us to count them all and return their numbers. Also, if we’re getting too many, like 1 billion, we should return -1 immediately.\n\nFor instance, consider this array: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]. We got no less than 5 pairs of passing cars: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 3) and (2, 4).\n\nConditions and limitations: N will never be 0, it will always fall within the range [1…100,000]. Also, each element in the array will always be either 1 or 0.\n\nOne approach I found that works is one that makes use of these so-called “prefix sums”. Think of them as an array of sums, where each element in that array is the sum of the first i elements. Now, since our numbers in the cars array are only 1s or 0s, building a prefix sum array out of the 1s will be the same as building a prefix counter array of the 1s in the array. Thus, the task gets reduced to this: for each 0 in the array, we should effectively count how many 1s there are to the right of it. How? simple: by computing the following difference: ones_after_i = ones_in_total — ones_before_i.\n\nScore obtained using this approach: 100% (obviously, otherwise I would not share it with you). Complexity as reported by Codility: O(N).\n\nHope you enjoyed it! Next one’s gonna be a tiny bit more interesting, at least that’s how it was for me, though still not a real challenge. See you then and happy coding!"

        "document": "This page documents the time-complexity (aka \"Big O\" or \"Big Oh\") of various operations in current CPython. Other Python implementations (or older or still-under development versions of CPython) may have slightly different performance characteristics. However, it is generally safe to assume that they are not slower by more than a factor of O(log n).\n\nGenerally, 'n' is the number of elements currently in the container. 'k' is either the value of a parameter or the number of elements in the parameter.\n\nInternally, a list is represented as an array; the largest costs come from growing beyond the current allocation size (because everything must move), or from inserting or deleting somewhere near the beginning (because everything after that must move). If you need to add/remove at both ends, consider using a collections.deque instead.\n\nA deque (double-ended queue) is represented internally as a doubly linked list. (Well, a list of arrays rather than objects, for greater efficiency.) Both ends are accessible, but even looking at the middle is slow, and adding to or removing from the middle is slower still.\n\nSee dict -- the implementation is intentionally very similar.\n• None As seen in the source code the complexities for set difference s-t or s.difference(t) ( ) and in-place set difference s.difference_update(t) ( ) are different! The first one is O(len(s)) (for every element in s add it to the new set, if not in t). The second one is O(len(t)) (for every element in t remove it from s). So care must be taken as to which is preferred, depending on which one is the longest set and whether a new set is needed.\n• To perform set operations like s-t, both s and t need to be sets. However you can do the method equivalents even if t is any iterable, for example s.difference(l), where l is a list.\n\nThe Average Case times listed for dict objects assume that the hash function for the objects is sufficiently robust to make collisions uncommon. The Average Case assumes the keys used in parameters are selected uniformly at random from the set of all keys.\n\nNote that there is a fast-path for dicts that (in practice) only deal with str keys; this doesn't affect the algorithmic complexity, but it can significantly affect the constant factors: how quickly a typical program finishes.\n\n[1] = These operations rely on the \"Amortized\" part of \"Amortized Worst Case\". Individual actions may take surprisingly long, depending on the history of the container.\n\n[2] = Popping the intermediate element at index k from a list of size n shifts all elements after k by one slot to the left using memmove. n - k elements have to be moved, so the operation is O(n - k). The best case is popping the second to last element, which necessitates one move, the worst case is popping the first element, which involves n - 1 moves. The average case for an average value of k is popping the element the middle of the list, which takes O(n/2) = O(n) operations.\n\n[3] = For these operations, the worst case n is the maximum size the container ever achieved, rather than just the current size. For example, if N objects are added to a dictionary, then N-1 are deleted, the dictionary will still be sized for N objects (at least) until another insertion is made."

        "document": "Python lists are versatile data structures that allow you to store and manipulate collections of items. When working with lists, it’s important to understand the efficiency of different operations. In this article, we will explore the Big O complexity of common list operations, helping you make informed decisions about algorithm design and performance optimizations.\n\nAccessing an element in a Python list by its index is an efficient operation with constant time complexity. Under the hood, lists use an underlying array structure to store their elements. This enables direct access to any element by index, resulting in O(1) complexity. Regardless of the size of the list, accessing an element takes the same amount of time.\n\nSearching for an element: O(n)\n\nSearching for an element in a list requires iterating through each element until a match is found or the entire list is traversed. In the worst case, where the element is not present in the list, this operation has a linear time complexity of O(n). The time required for searching grows proportionally with the size of the list.\n\nInsertion or deletion at the end of the list: O(1)\n\nAppending or removing an element at the end of a Python list is an efficient operation with constant time complexity. These operations involve manipulating the underlying array, making them O(1). The size of the list does not impact the time taken.\n\nInsertion or deletion at the beginning or middle of the list: O(n)\n\nWhen inserting or deleting an element at the beginning or middle of a Python list, the remaining elements must be shifted to accommodate the change. As a result, these operations have a linear time complexity of O(n). The time taken depends on the number of elements that need to be shifted.\n\nInsertion or deletion at a specific index: O(n)\n\nInserting or deleting an element at a specific index in a Python list requires shifting elements to accommodate the change. As a result, these operations have a linear time complexity of O(n). The time taken depends on the number of elements that need to be shifted.\n\nAppending one list to another: O(k)\n\nAppending one list to another in Python takes time proportional\n\nto the length of the list being appended (k). The elements of the second list need to be copied to the first list, resulting in O(k) complexity.\n\nExtending one list with another: O(k)\n\nExtending one list with another in Python has a similar time complexity to appending. It takes time proportional to the length of the list being extended (k), as the elements of the second list need to be appended to the first list.\n\nSlicing a Python list to extract a sublist takes time proportional to the length of the resulting sublist (k). The elements of the sublist need to be copied, resulting in O(k) complexity.\n\nIt’s important to note that these time complexities are average cases, and they may vary depending on factors such as the size of the list, the specific operation being performed, and the underlying implementation of the Python interpreter.\n\nUnderstanding the Big O complexity of different list operations can help you optimize your code and choose appropriate data structures and algorithms for efficient performance."

        "document": "Let's look at the time complexity of different Python data structures and algorithms.\n\nThis article is primarily meant to act as a Python time complexity cheat sheet for those who already understand what time complexity is and how the time complexity of an operation might affect your code. For a more thorough explanation of time complexity see Ned Batchelder's article/talk on this subject.\n\nTime complexity is one of those Computer Science concepts that's scary in its purest form, but often fairly practical as a rough \"am I doing this right\" measurement.\n\nIn the words of Ned Batchelder, time complexity is all about \"how your code slows as your data grows\".\n\nTime complexity is usually discussed in terms of \"Big O\" notation. This is basically a way to discuss the order of magnitude for a given operation while ignoring the exact number of computations it needs. In \"Big O\" land, we don't care if something is twice as slow, but we do care whether it's times slower where is the length of our list/set/slice/etc.\n\nRemember that these lines are simply about orders of magnitude. If an operation is on the order of , that means 100 times more data will slow things down about 100 times. If an operation is on the order of (that's ), that means 100 times more data will slow things down times.\n\nI usually think about those curves in terms of what would happen if we suddenly had 1,000 times more data to work with:\n\nWith that very quick recap behind us, let's take a look at the relative speeds of all common operations on each of Python's data structures.\n\nPython's lists are similar to arrays or array lists in some other languages.\n\nHere are the time complexities of some common list operations:\n\nI've called out , , and above because new Python programmers are sometimes surprised by the relative speeds of those operations.\n\nAdding or removing items from the end of a list are both very fast operations regardless of how large the list is. On the other hand, adding or removing items from the beginning of a list is very slow (it requires shifting all items after the change).\n\nNote that indexing and assigning to indexes is fast regardless of the index. Also note that the operator requires looping over the list, unlike sets (as we'll see below).\n\nIn case you're curious, here are even more list operations:\n\nFor the method and operation, represents the length of the other iterable/sequence. For slicing, represents the length of the slice.\n\nLists are stack-like. That means it's inexpensive to perform operations on the most-recently added items (at the end of a list).\n\nFor inexpensive operations involving the least-recently added item (the beginning of a list), we'd need a queue-like structure. That's what Python's data structure is for.\n\nHere are the time complexities of common operations:\n\nNote that we can efficiently add and remove items from the beginning of a deque with the and methods. If you find yourself calling the or methods on a list with an index of , you could probably speed your code up by using a instead.\n\nAlso note that, looking up arbitrary indexes in objects requires looping! Unlike lists, objects are implemented as a doubly-linked list. Fortunately, looking up arbitrary indexes is pretty unusual for both lists and deque objects in Python (since our loops are not index-based).\n\nDictionaries are meant for grouping or accumulating values based on a key. Our \"dictionaries\" in Python are called hash maps (or sometimes \"associative arrays\") in many other programming languages.\n\nHere are the time complexities of some common dictionary operations:\n\nNote that the only expensive operation on a dictionary involves explicitly looping over the dictionary.\n\nThanks to the power of hashing, dictionaries are very fast at all operations related to key lookups. Checking for containment, inserting a new item, updating the value of an item, and removing an item are all constant time operations (that's in big O).\n\nHere are time complexities of slightly less common dictionary operations:\n\nThe in for the method represents the number of items in the given iterable.\n\nNote that getting the first and last items is a bit awkward, but very fast.\n\nAlso note that checking whether a dictionary contains a particular value is slow! Dictionaries are optimized for fast key lookups, but not fast value lookups. Key containment checks are fast, but value containment checks require looping over the whole dictionary.\n\nUnlike lists, sets don't maintain the order of their items. Instead, they're optimized for quick containment checks.\n\nHere are the time complexities of some common set operations:\n\nLike dictionaries, the only expensive operation on a set involves explicitly looping over the set.\n\nMost importantly, asking whether a set contains an item ( ) is fast, unlike lists.\n\nSets also support various operations between multiple sets:\n\nI'm assuming the sets are the same size here. If the sets are different sizes, some of those operations will be on the order of either the smallest or largest set size (depending on the operation).\n\nAlso note that all of those operations work the same way between dictionary keys as well! For example, if you wanted to efficiently find the common keys between two dictionaries, you can use the operator:\n\nPython's module includes a class which can efficiently count the number of times each item occurs within a given iterable.\n\nThis class is really just a specialized dictionary with some extra operations.\n\nHere are the time complexities of some common operations:\n\nNote that the method does the same thing as the dictionary method, except it sorts the first. Although, if a number is passed to , it will efficiently lookup the most common items instead (similar to the function noted in traversal techniques below).\n\nHere are a few more somewhat common operations:\n\nThe in above represents the length of the given iterable to the and methods.\n\nNeed a heap, possibly for the sake of implementing your own priority queue? Python's module has you covered.\n\nHere are the time complexities of various heap-related operations provided by the module:\n\nThe module really just performs operations on a list to treat it like a heap.\n\nIt's pretty unusual to implement long-running daemon processes that add items to and remove items from a custom priority queue, so you're unlikely to need a heap directly within your own code.\n\nThe module does have some handy helper utilities that are heap-powered though (see traversal techniques below).\n\nNeed to find items or ranges of items within a sorted list? The module has an implementation of binary search for you.\n\nHere are the time complexities of the module's various binary search operations:\n\nNote that you can combine and to efficiently find all items in a sorted list that are within a certain upper and lower bound.\n\nKeep in mind that the act of sorting a list takes more time than traversing, so unless you're working with already sorted data or you're repeatedly bisecting your sorted list, it may be more efficient to simply loop over an unsorted list.\n\nAlso keep in mind that adding a new value to a sorted list is slow for the same reason that the list method is slow: all values after the insertion index will need to be shuffled around.\n\nLastly, let's look at a few common lookup/traversal techniques.\n\nMost traversal techniques require looping over the given iterable, so they're at minimum.\n\nThe traversals that require more time are the ones that involve comparisons between more than just two values (like sorting every item).\n\nEfficient sorting is in time complexity terms. Whether you're using the list method or the built-in function, Python attempts to sort as efficiently as it can.\n\nIf you don't really care about sorting every value, but instead you just need the largest or smallest values, the module has some heap-powered utilities that are even faster than sorting.\n\nComputer Science includes a number of other classical structures, including but not limited to:\n\nWhy aren't these structures included in the Python standard library?\n\nWell, as Brandon Rhodes noted in his PyCon 2014 talk, many of the classic CS data structures don't really make sense in Python because data structures in Python don't contain actually data but instead contain references to data (see variables and objects in Python).\n\nWhen you do need a data structure that's optimized for specific operations, you can always lookup an implementation online or find a PyPI module (such as sortedcollections).\n\nNote that time complexity can really compound when you're performing operations within a loop.\n\nFor example, this code has an time complexity because it contains a loop inside a loop:\n\nThe loop looks like a loop, but where's the other loop?\n\nThe list method actually performs an implicit loop because it needs to loop over the list to perform its counting!\n\nSince we're performing an operation for each iteration of our loop, this code is , which is usually written as or . Remember that really steep line in the time complexity plot above? That's !\n\nSometimes it's impossible to avoid an operation. But it's often possible to change your algorithm or your data structures to greatly alter your code's time complexity. In our case we could avoid the method call in our loop by incrementing an item count for each item we see:\n\nDictionary containment checks, key lookups, and item assignments are all operations. So this new loop now has an time complexity!\n\nThis code doesn't look any faster at a quick glance. But it will be much faster for large amounts of data. For 1,000 times more data, our code will only be 1,000 times slower, whereas the previous loop would have been 1,000,000 times slower!\n\nYou can play with different list sizes for each of the above loops in this code snippet.\n\nNote: for readability's sake, our whole loop could also just be one line with .\n\nChoosing between data structures involves a trade-off between features, speed, and memory usage.\n\nFor example, sets are faster at key lookups than lists, but they have no ordering. Dictionaries are just as fast at key lookups as sets and they maintain item insertion order, but they require more memory.\n\nIn day-to-day Python usage, time complexity tends to matter most for avoiding loops within loops.\n\nIf you take away just two things from this article, they should be:\n• Refactor time complexity code to whenever possible\n• When performance really matters, avoid whenever or are possible\n\nThe next time you're worried about slow code, consider your code's time complexity. The biggest code speed ups often come from thinking in orders of magnitude."

Once you start getting above n = 100,000 (meaning 100,000 starting inputs) checking the list takes a noticeably longer time, and any optimization could cut out an entire hour of calculating for larger values of n."

        "document": "A common task when working with lists is to count how many times a specific element appears. In Python, we have several ways to count occurrences of an element using both built-in and custom methods.\n\nThe simplest and most straightforward way to count occurrences of an element in a list is by using the count() method, which is a built-in method specifically designed for this task.\n\nIn this example, we have a list and we are counting the occurrences of 2 and 3 using the count() method.\n\nBelow are the other methods by which we can use to count the occurrences of an element in a list.\n\nIn this method, iterate over the list using loop (for loop) and keep a counter variable to count the occurrences. Each time we find the target element, increase the counter by one.\n\nThe countOf() function is equivalent to using the count() method of a list, but it comes from the operator module.\n\nIt takes two arguments: the sequence in which we want to count and the value that we want to count. Let’s look at the syntax given below:\n\nThe Counter class from the collections module can count occurrences for all elements and returns the results as a dictionary. Let’s see how can we use this to count occurrence of a single element.\n\nNote: This method is not efficient for finding occurrence of single element because it requires O(n) extra space to create a new dictionary. But this method is very efficient when finding all occurrences of elements.\n• None Count of elements matching particular condition in Python\n• None Count Occurrences of Specific Value in Pandas Column"

To efficiently count items in a list, you can use Python’s built-in functions.\n\nGet the Number of Elements\n\nWe can declare a counter variable to count the number of elements in the list using a for loop and print the counter after the loop in Python gets terminated. In this way we get number of items in a list.\n\nlength_hint Get the Number of Elements in a List\n\nIn this example we are using the length_hint() function to get number of items in a list.\n\nThis code uses the NumPy library to count the number of elements in a Python list named , which contains the elements [1, 2, 3, 4]. The code prints the list and then outputs the message “No of elements in list are: 4,” indicating that there are four elements in the list.\n\nTime Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list\n\nAuxiliary Space: O(1)\n\nGet Number of Unique Elements in a List\n\nTo get the number of unique elements in a list, we can use the data structure in Python.\n\nIn this code, contains duplicate elements. By converting it to a set, we eliminate duplicates, and then we calculate the length of the set to get the count of unique elements.\n\nGet Total Number of Elements in a List Containing Other Lists\n\nTo get the total number of elements in a list that contains other lists, you can use recursion to traverse all the nested lists and count their elements. In this way we count items in list.\n\nThis code defines a function that recursively iterates through the list and its sublists. It counts the elements and returns the total count. The example demonstrates the function’s usage.\n\nHow to Get the Number of Elements in a Python List? – FAQs\n\n\n\n How Do You Find the Number of Certain Elements in a List in Python?\n\nWhat is the Len Function in Python?\n\nHow Do You Find the Number of Elements in a Set in Python?\n\nHow Do You Count the Same Elements in a List in Python?\n\nHow Do You Get the Total Number of Elements in a List of Lists in Python?\n\nTo get the total number of elements in a list of lists, you can use a combination of the function with a generator expression that iterates over the sublists to count their lengths. \n\n \n\n print(\"Total number of elements in list of lists:\", total_elements) This method sums the lengths of all sublists, providing the total count of elements across all the lists combined"

        "document": "Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that describes the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the amount of time it takes to run. It is an important consideration when designing and analyzing algorithms, as it can have a significant impact on the performance and scalability of a program.\n\nTime complexity is a measure of how the running time of an algorithm scales with the size of its input. It is typically expressed using Big O notation, which provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the algorithm's running time. The Big O notation describes the worst-case scenario, which means that the algorithm's running time will never be worse than the given time complexity.\n\nTo calculate the time complexity of an algorithm, you need to analyze the number of operations performed by the algorithm as a function of the input size. This can be done by breaking down the algorithm into its basic operations and counting the number of times each operation is performed.\n\nHere's an example of how to calculate the time complexity of a simple algorithm that finds the maximum value in a list:\n\nIn this algorithm, we have three basic operations:\n• Iterating through the list of numbers\n• Comparing each number to the current\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the size of the input list. This is because the number of operations performed by the algorithm is directly proportional to the size of the input.\n\nThere are several common time complexity scenarios that you may encounter when working with algorithms:\n\nUnderstanding these time complexity scenarios and their implications is crucial for designing efficient algorithms and optimizing the performance of your Python programs."
