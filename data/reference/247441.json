        "document": "\n• Closing all the connections in a pool\n• Getting the id of an inserted row\n• Getting the number of affected rows\n• Getting the number of changed rows\n\nThis is a Node.js module available through the npm registry.\n\nBefore installing, download and install Node.js. Node.js 0.6 or higher is required.\n\nInstallation is done using the command:\n\nFor information about the previous 0.9.x releases, visit the v0.9 branch.\n\nSometimes I may also ask you to install the latest version from Github to check if a bugfix is working. In this case, please do:\n\nThis is a node.js driver for mysql. It is written in JavaScript, does not require compiling, and is 100% MIT licensed.\n\nHere is an example on how to use it:\n\nFrom this example, you can learn the following:\n• Every method you invoke on a connection is queued and executed in sequence.\n• Closing the connection is done using which makes sure all remaining queries are executed before sending a quit packet to the mysql server.\n\nThanks goes to the people who have contributed code to this module, see the GitHub Contributors page.\n\nAdditionally I'd like to thank the following people:\n• Andrey Hristov (Oracle) - for helping me with protocol questions.\n• Ulf Wendel (Oracle) - for helping me with protocol questions.\n\nThe following companies have supported this project financially, allowing me to spend more time on it (ordered by time of contribution):\n• Transloadit (my startup, we do file uploading & video encoding as a service, check it out)\n\nIf you'd like to discuss this module, or ask questions about it, please use one of the following:\n• IRC Channel: #node.js (on freenode.net, I pay attention to any message including the term )\n\nThe recommended way to establish a connection is this:\n\nHowever, a connection can also be implicitly established by invoking a query:\n\nDepending on how you like to handle your errors, either method may be appropriate. Any type of connection error (handshake or network) is considered a fatal error, see the Error Handling section for more information.\n\nWhen establishing a connection, you can set the following options:\n• : The hostname of the database you are connecting to. (Default: )\n• : The port number to connect to. (Default: )\n• : The source IP address to use for TCP connection. (Optional)\n• : The path to a unix domain socket to connect to. When used and are ignored.\n• : The MySQL user to authenticate as.\n• : The password of that MySQL user.\n• : Name of the database to use for this connection (Optional).\n• : The charset for the connection. This is called \"collation\" in the SQL-level of MySQL (like ). If a SQL-level charset is specified (like ) then the default collation for that charset is used. (Default: )\n• : The timezone configured on the MySQL server. This is used to type cast server date/time values to JavaScript object and vice versa. This can be , , or an offset in the form or . (Default: )\n• : The milliseconds before a timeout occurs during the initial connection to the MySQL server. (Default: )\n• : Stringify objects instead of converting to values. (Default: )\n• : Allow connecting to MySQL instances that ask for the old (insecure) authentication method. (Default: )\n• : Determines if column values should be converted to native JavaScript types. (Default: )\n• : When dealing with big numbers (BIGINT and DECIMAL columns) in the database, you should enable this option (Default: ).\n• : Enabling both and forces big numbers (BIGINT and DECIMAL columns) to be always returned as JavaScript String objects (Default: ). Enabling but leaving disabled will return big numbers as String objects only when they cannot be accurately represented with [JavaScript Number objects] (https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-ecmascript-language-types-number-type) (which happens when they exceed the [-2^53, +2^53] range), otherwise they will be returned as Number objects. This option is ignored if is disabled.\n• : Force date types (TIMESTAMP, DATETIME, DATE) to be returned as strings rather than inflated into JavaScript Date objects. Can be / or an array of type names to keep as strings. (Default: )\n• : Prints protocol details to stdout. Can be / or an array of packet type names that should be printed. (Default: )\n• : Generates stack traces on to include call site of library entrance (\"long stack traces\"). Slight performance penalty for most calls. (Default: )\n• : Allow to use the modifier. (Default: )\n• : Allow multiple mysql statements per query. Be careful with this, it could increase the scope of SQL injection attacks. (Default: )\n• : List of connection flags to use other than the default ones. It is also possible to blacklist default ones. For more information, check Connection Flags.\n• : object with ssl parameters or a string containing name of ssl profile. See SSL options.\n\nIn addition to passing these options as an object, you can also use a url string. For example:\n\nNote: The query values are first attempted to be parsed as JSON, and if that fails assumed to be plaintext strings.\n\nThe option in the connection options takes a string or an object. When given a string, it uses one of the predefined SSL profiles included. The following profiles are included:\n• : this profile is for connecting to an Amazon RDS server and contains the certificates from https://rds.amazonaws.com/doc/rds-ssl-ca-cert.pem and https://s3.amazonaws.com/rds-downloads/rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem\n\nWhen connecting to other servers, you will need to provide an object with any of the following options:\n• : The certificate(s) to trust instead of the ones Node.js is configured to trust. This refers to the value of the certificate(s) and not a filename of the certificate(s). This is passed as the option for the underlying call (or underlying if using Node.js below 0.12).\n• : The client certificate to use in the SSL handshake. This is passed as the option for the underlying call (or underlying if using Node.js below 0.12).\n• : The ciphers to use to use in the SSL handshake instead of the default ones for Node.js. This is passed as the option for call (or underlying if using Node.js below 0.12).\n• : This is passed as the option for the underlying call.\n• : This is passed as the option for the underlying call.\n• : This is passed as the option for call (or underlying if using Node.js below 0.12).\n• : This is passed as the option for call (or underlying if using Node.js below 0.12).\n• : The server certificate is verified against the list of supplied CAs and the hostname, and if no match is found, the SSL connection will fail. (Default: )\n\nHere is a simple example:\n\nYou can also connect to a MySQL server without properly providing the appropriate CA to trust. You should not do this.\n\nIf, for any reason, you would like to change the default connection flags, you can use the connection option . Pass a string with a comma separated list of items to add to the default flags. If you don't want a default flag to be used prepend the flag with a minus sign. To add a flag that is not in the default list, just write the flag name, or prefix it with a plus (case insensitive).\n\nThe following flags are available:\n• - Enable protocol compression. This feature is not currently supported by the Node.js implementation so cannot be turned on. (Default off)\n• - Ability to specify the database on connection. (Default on)\n• - Send the found rows instead of the affected rows as . (Default on)\n• - Don't issue SIGPIPE if network failures. This flag has no effect on this Node.js implementation. (Default on)\n• - Let the parser ignore spaces before the in queries. (Default on)\n• - Indicates to the MySQL server this is an \"interactive\" client. This will use the interactive timeouts on the MySQL server and report as interactive in the process list. (Default off)\n• - Can use . This flag is controlled by the connection option . (Default on)\n• - Use the improved version of Old Password Authentication. (Default on)\n• - Can handle multiple resultsets for queries. (Default on)\n• - The client may send multiple statement per query or statement prepare (separated by ). This flag is controlled by the connection option . (Default off)\n• Special handling of ODBC behaviour. This flag has no effect on this Node.js implementation. (Default on)\n• - Uses the plugin authentication mechanism when connecting to the MySQL server. This feature is not currently supported by the Node.js implementation so cannot be turned on. (Default off)\n• - Uses the 4.1 protocol. (Default on)\n• - Can handle multiple resultsets for execute. (Default on)\n• - This is specific to the C client, and has no effect on this Node.js implementation. (Default off)\n• - Old flag for the 4.1 protocol. (Default on)\n• - Use SSL after handshake to encrypt data in transport. This feature is controlled though the connection option, so the flag has no effect. (Default off)\n• - Verify the server certificate during SSL set up. This feature is controlled though the connection option, so the flag has no effect. (Default off)\n• - Asks for the transaction status flags. (Default on)\n\nThere are two ways to end a connection. Terminating a connection gracefully is done by calling the method:\n\nThis will make sure all previously enqueued queries are still executed before sending a packet to the MySQL server. If a fatal error occurs before the packet can be sent, an argument will be provided to the callback, but the connection will be terminated regardless of that.\n\nAn alternative way to end the connection is to call the method. This will cause an immediate termination of the underlying socket. Additionally guarantees that no more events or callbacks will be triggered for the connection.\n\nUnlike the method does not take a callback argument.\n\nRather than creating and managing connections one-by-one, this module also provides built-in connection pooling using . Read more about connection pooling.\n\nCreate a pool and use it directly:\n\nThis is a shortcut for the -> -> code flow. Using is useful to share connection state for subsequent queries. This is because two calls to may use two different connections and run in parallel. This is the basic structure:\n\nIf you would like to close the connection and remove it from the pool, use instead. The pool will create a new connection the next time one is needed.\n\nConnections are lazily created by the pool. If you configure the pool to allow up to 100 connections, but only ever use 5 simultaneously, only 5 connections will be made. Connections are also cycled round-robin style, with connections being taken from the top of the pool and returning to the bottom.\n\nWhen a previous connection is retrieved from the pool, a ping packet is sent to the server to check if the connection is still good.\n\nPools accept all the same options as a connection. When creating a new connection, the options are simply passed to the connection constructor. In addition to those options pools accept a few extras:\n• : The milliseconds before a timeout occurs during the connection acquisition. This is slightly different from , because acquiring a pool connection does not always involve making a connection. If a connection request is queued, the time the request spends in the queue does not count towards this timeout. (Default: )\n• : Determines the pool's action when no connections are available and the limit has been reached. If , the pool will queue the connection request and call it when one becomes available. If , the pool will immediately call back with an error. (Default: )\n• : The maximum number of connections to create at once. (Default: )\n• : The maximum number of connection requests the pool will queue before returning an error from . If set to , there is no limit to the number of queued connection requests. (Default: )\n\nThe pool will emit an event when a connection is acquired from the pool. This is called after all acquiring activity has been performed on the connection, right before the connection is handed to the callback of the acquiring code.\n\nThe pool will emit a event when a new connection is made within the pool. If you need to set session variables on the connection before it gets used, you can listen to the event.\n\nThe pool will emit an event when a callback has been queued to wait for an available connection.\n\nThe pool will emit a event when a connection is released back to the pool. This is called after all release activity has been performed on the connection, so the connection will be listed as free at the time of the event.\n\nWhen you are done using the pool, you have to end all the connections or the Node.js event loop will stay active until the connections are closed by the MySQL server. This is typically done if the pool is used in a script or when trying to gracefully shutdown a server. To end all the connections in the pool, use the method on the pool:\n\nThe method takes an optional callback that you can use to know when all the connections are ended.\n\nOnce is called, and other operations can no longer be performed. Wait until all connections in the pool are released before calling . If you use the shortcut method , in place of → → , wait until it completes.\n\ncalls on every active connection in the pool. This queues a packet on the connection and sets a flag to prevent from creating new connections. All commands / queries already in progress will complete, but new commands won't execute.\n• : If , will attempt to reconnect when connection fails. (Default: )\n• : If connection fails, node's increases. When is greater than , remove a node in the . (Default: )\n• : If connection fails, specifies the number of milliseconds before another connection attempt will be made. If set to , then node will be removed instead and never re-used. (Default: )\n• : The default selector. (Default: )\n• : Select the first node available unconditionally.\n\nMySQL offers a changeUser command that allows you to alter the current user and other aspects of the connection without shutting down the underlying socket:\n\nThe available options for this feature are:\n• : The name of the new user (defaults to the previous one).\n• : The password of the new user (defaults to the previous one).\n• : The new charset (defaults to the previous one).\n• : The new database (defaults to the previous one).\n\nA sometimes useful side effect of this functionality is that this function also resets any connection state (variables, transactions, etc.).\n\nErrors encountered during this operation are treated as fatal connection errors by this module.\n\nYou may lose the connection to a MySQL server due to network problems, the server timing you out, the server being restarted, or crashing. All of these events are considered fatal errors, and will have the . See the Error Handling section for more information.\n\nRe-connecting a connection is done by establishing a new connection. Once terminated, an existing connection object cannot be re-connected by design.\n\nWith Pool, disconnected connections will be removed from the pool freeing up space for a new connection to be created on the next getConnection call.\n\nWith PoolCluster, disconnected connections will count as errors against the related node, incrementing the error code for that node. Once there are more than errors on a given node, it is removed from the cluster. When this occurs, the PoolCluster may emit a error if there are no longer any matching nodes for the pattern. The config can be set to restore offline nodes after a given timeout.\n\nThe most basic way to perform a query is to call the method on an object (like a , , or instance).\n\nThe simplest form of is , where a SQL string is the first argument and the second is a callback:\n\nThe second form comes when using placeholder values (see escaping query values):\n\nThe third form comes when using various advanced options on the query, like escaping query values, joins with overlapping column names, timeouts, and type casting.\n\nNote that a combination of the second and third forms can be used where the placeholder values are passed as an argument and not in the options object. The argument will override the in the option object.\n\nIf the query only has a single replacement character ( ), and the value is not , , or an array, it can be passed directly as the second argument to :\n\nCaution These methods of escaping values only works when the NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES SQL mode is disabled (which is the default state for MySQL servers).\n\nCaution This library performs client-side escaping, as this is a library to generate SQL strings on the client side. The syntax for functions like may look similar to a prepared statement, but it is not and the escaping rules from this module are used to generate a resulting SQL string. The purpose of escaping input is to avoid SQL Injection attacks. In order to support enhanced support like and formatting, this module will escape based on the shape of the passed in JavaScript value, and the resulting escaped string may be more than a single value. When structured user input is provided as the value to escape, care should be taken to validate the shape of the input to validate the output will be what is expected.\n\nIn order to avoid SQL Injection attacks, you should always escape any user provided data before using it inside a SQL query. You can do so using the , or methods:\n\nAlternatively, you can use characters as placeholders for values you would like to have escaped like this:\n\nMultiple placeholders are mapped to values in the same order as passed. For example, in the following query equals , equals , equals , and will be :\n\nThis looks similar to prepared statements in MySQL, however it really just uses the same method internally.\n\nCaution This also differs from prepared statements in that all are replaced, even those contained in comments and strings.\n\nDifferent value types are escaped differently, here is how:\n• Arrays are turned into list, e.g. turns into\n• Nested arrays are turned into grouped lists (for bulk inserts), e.g. turns into\n• Objects that have a method will have called and the returned value is used as the raw SQL.\n• Objects are turned into pairs for each enumerable property on the object. If the property's value is a function, it is skipped; if the property's value is an object, toString() is called on it and the returned value is used.\n• / are left as-is. MySQL does not support these, and trying to insert them as values will trigger MySQL errors until they implement support.\n\nThis escaping allows you to do neat things like this:\n\nAnd the method allows you to form complex queries with functions:\n\nTo generate objects with a method, the method can be used. This creates an object that will be left un-touched when using in a placeholder, useful for using functions as dynamic values:\n\nCaution The string provided to will skip all escaping functions when used, so be careful when passing in unvalidated input.\n\nIf you feel the need to escape queries by yourself, you can also use the escaping function directly:\n\nIf you can't trust an SQL identifier (database / table / column name) because it is provided by a user, you should escape it with , or like this:\n\nIt also supports adding qualified identifiers. It will escape both parts.\n\nIf you do not want to treat as qualified identifiers, you can set the second argument to in order to keep the string as a literal identifier:\n\nAlternatively, you can use characters as placeholders for identifiers you would like to have escaped like this:\n\nPlease note that this last character sequence is experimental and syntax might change\n\nWhen you pass an Object to or , is used to avoid SQL injection in object keys.\n\nYou can use mysql.format to prepare a query with multiple insertion points, utilizing the proper escaping for ids and values. A simple example of this follows:\n\nFollowing this you then have a valid, escaped query that you can then send to the database safely. This is useful if you are looking to prepare the query before actually sending it to the database. As mysql.format is exposed from SqlString.format you also have the option (but are not required) to pass in stringifyObject and timezone, allowing you provide a custom means of turning objects into strings, as well as a location-specific/timezone-aware Date.\n\nIf you prefer to have another type of query escape format, there's a connection configuration option you can use to define a custom format function. You can access the connection object if you want to use the built-in or any other connection function.\n\nHere's an example of how to implement another format:\n\nIf you are inserting a row into a table with an auto increment primary key, you can retrieve the insert id like this:\n\nWhen dealing with big numbers (above JavaScript Number precision limit), you should consider enabling option to be able to read the insert id as a string, otherwise it will throw an error.\n\nThis option is also required when fetching big numbers from the database, otherwise you will get values rounded to hundreds or thousands due to the precision limit.\n\nYou can get the number of affected rows from an insert, update or delete statement.\n\nYou can get the number of changed rows from an update statement.\n\n\"changedRows\" differs from \"affectedRows\" in that it does not count updated rows whose values were not changed.\n\nYou can get the MySQL connection ID (\"thread ID\") of a given connection using the property.\n\nThe MySQL protocol is sequential, this means that you need multiple connections to execute queries in parallel. You can use a Pool to manage connections, one simple approach is to create one connection per incoming http request.\n\nSometimes you may want to select large quantities of rows and process each of them as they are received. This can be done like this:\n\nPlease note a few things about the example above:\n• Usually you will want to receive a certain amount of rows before starting to throttle the connection using . This number will depend on the amount and size of your rows.\n• / operate on the underlying socket and parser. You are guaranteed that no more events will fire after calling .\n• You MUST NOT provide a callback to the method when streaming rows.\n• The event will fire for both rows as well as OK packets confirming the success of a INSERT/UPDATE query.\n• It is very important not to leave the result paused too long, or you may encounter The time limit for this is determined by the net_write_timeout setting on your MySQL server.\n\nAdditionally you may be interested to know that it is currently not possible to stream individual row columns, they will always be buffered up entirely. If you have a good use case for streaming large fields to and from MySQL, I'd love to get your thoughts and contributions on this.\n\nThe query object provides a convenience method that wraps query events into a Readable Stream object. This stream can easily be piped downstream and provides automatic pause/resume, based on downstream congestion and the optional . The parameter of the stream is set to and cannot be changed (if you need a byte stream, you will need to use a transform stream, like objstream for example).\n\nFor example, piping query results into another stream (with a max buffer of 5 objects) is simply:\n\nSupport for multiple statements is disabled for security reasons (it allows for SQL injection attacks if values are not properly escaped). To use this feature you have to enable it for your connection:\n\nOnce enabled, you can execute multiple statement queries like any other query:\n\nAdditionally you can also stream the results of multiple statement queries:\n\nIf one of the statements in your query causes an error, the resulting Error object contains a property which tells you which statement caused it. MySQL will also stop executing any remaining statements when an error occurs.\n\nPlease note that the interface for streaming multiple statement queries is experimental and I am looking forward to feedback on it.\n\nYou can call stored procedures from your queries as with any other mysql driver. If the stored procedure produces several result sets, they are exposed to you the same way as the results for multiple statement queries.\n\nWhen executing joins, you are likely to get result sets with overlapping column names.\n\nBy default, node-mysql will overwrite colliding column names in the order the columns are received from MySQL, causing some of the received values to be unavailable.\n\nHowever, you can also specify that you want your columns to be nested below the table name like this:\n\nOr use a string separator to have your results merged.\n\nSimple transaction support is available at the connection level:\n\nPlease note that beginTransaction(), commit() and rollback() are simply convenience functions that execute the START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK commands respectively. It is important to understand that many commands in MySQL can cause an implicit commit, as described in the MySQL documentation\n\nA ping packet can be sent over a connection using the method. This method will send a ping packet to the server and when the server responds, the callback will fire. If an error occurred, the callback will fire with an error argument.\n\nEvery operation takes an optional inactivity timeout option. This allows you to specify appropriate timeouts for operations. It is important to note that these timeouts are not part of the MySQL protocol, and rather timeout operations through the client. This means that when a timeout is reached, the connection it occurred on will be destroyed and no further operations can be performed.\n\nThis module comes with a consistent approach to error handling that you should review carefully in order to write solid applications.\n\nMost errors created by this module are instances of the JavaScript Error object. Additionally they typically come with two extra properties:\n• : String, contains the MySQL server error symbol if the error is a MySQL server error (e.g. ), a Node.js error code if it is a Node.js error (e.g. ), or an internal error code (e.g. ).\n• : Number, contains the MySQL server error number. Only populated from MySQL server error.\n• : Boolean, indicating if this error is terminal to the connection object. If the error is not from a MySQL protocol operation, this property will not be defined.\n• : String, contains the full SQL of the failed query. This can be useful when using a higher level interface like an ORM that is generating the queries.\n• : String, contains the five-character SQLSTATE value. Only populated from MySQL server error.\n• : String, contains the message string that provides a textual description of the error. Only populated from MySQL server error.\n\nFatal errors are propagated to all pending callbacks. In the example below, a fatal error is triggered by trying to connect to a blocked port. Therefore the error object is propagated to both pending callbacks:\n\nNormal errors however are only delegated to the callback they belong to. So in the example below, only the first callback receives an error, the second query works as expected:\n\nLast but not least: If a fatal errors occurs and there are no pending callbacks, or a normal error occurs which has no callback belonging to it, the error is emitted as an event on the connection object. This is demonstrated in the example below:\n\nNote: events are special in node. If they occur without an attached listener, a stack trace is printed and your process is killed.\n\ntl;dr: This module does not want you to deal with silent failures. You should always provide callbacks to your method calls. If you want to ignore this advice and suppress unhandled errors, you can do this:\n\nThis module is exception safe. That means you can continue to use it, even if one of your callback functions throws an error which you're catching using 'uncaughtException' or a domain.\n\nFor your convenience, this driver will cast mysql types into native JavaScript types by default. The default behavior can be changed through various Connection options. The following mappings exist:\n• BIT (last byte will be filled with 0 bits as necessary)\n\nNote text in the binary character set is returned as , rather than a string.\n• TIME (could be mapped to Date, but what date would be set?)\n• GEOMETRY (never used those, get in touch if you do)\n\nIt is not recommended (and may go away / change in the future) to disable type casting, but you can currently do so on either the connection:\n\nOr on the query level:\n\nYou can also pass a function and handle type casting yourself. You're given some column information like database, table and name and also type and length. If you just want to apply a custom type casting to a specific type you can do it and then fallback to the default.\n\nThe function is provided two arguments and and is expected to return the value for the given field by invoking the parser functions through the object.\n\nThe argument is a object and contains data about the field that need to be parsed. The following are some of the properties on a object:\n• - a string of the database the field came from.\n• - a string of the table the field came from.\n• - a string of the field name.\n• - a string of the field type in all caps.\n• - a number of the field length, as given by the database.\n\nThe argument is a that, when called, will return the default type conversion for the given field.\n\nWhen getting the field data, the following helper methods are present on the object:\n• - parse the field as a geometry value.\n\nThe MySQL protocol is a text-based protocol. This means that over the wire, all field types are represented as a string, which is why only string-like functions are available on the object. Based on the type information (like ), the type cast should convert the string field into a different JavaScript type (like a ).\n\nHere's an example of converting to boolean:\n\nWARNING: YOU MUST INVOKE the parser using one of these three field functions in your custom typeCast callback. They can only be called once.\n\nIf you are running into problems, one thing that may help is enabling the mode for the connection:\n\nThis will print all incoming and outgoing packets on stdout. You can also restrict debugging to packet types by passing an array of types to debug:\n\nto restrict debugging to the query and data packets.\n\nIf that does not help, feel free to open a GitHub issue. A good GitHub issue will have:\n• The minimal amount of code required to reproduce the problem (if possible)\n• As much debugging output and information about your environment (mysql version, node version, os, etc.) as you can gather.\n\nSecurity issues should not be first reported through GitHub or another public forum, but kept private in order for the collaborators to assess the report and either (a) devise a fix and plan a release date or (b) assert that it is not a security issue (in which case it can be posted in a public forum, like a GitHub issue).\n\nThe primary private forum is email, either by emailing the module's author or opening a GitHub issue simply asking to whom a security issues should be addressed to without disclosing the issue or type of issue.\n\nAn ideal report would include a clear indication of what the security issue is and how it would be exploited, ideally with an accompanying proof of concept (\"PoC\") for collaborators to work against and validate potentional fixes against.\n\nThis project welcomes contributions from the community.

        "document": "\n• Closing all the connections in a pool\n• Getting the id of an inserted row\n• Getting the number of affected rows\n• Getting the number of changed rows\n\nThis is a Node.js module available through the npm registry.\n\nBefore installing, download and install Node.js. Node.js 0.6 or higher is required.\n\nInstallation is done using the command:\n\nFor information about the previous 0.9.x releases, visit the v0.9 branch.\n\nSometimes I may also ask you to install the latest version from Github to check if a bugfix is working. In this case, please do:\n\nThis is a node.js driver for mysql. It is written in JavaScript, does not require compiling, and is 100% MIT licensed.\n\nHere is an example on how to use it:\n\nFrom this example, you can learn the following:\n• Every method you invoke on a connection is queued and executed in sequence.\n• Closing the connection is done using which makes sure all remaining queries are executed before sending a quit packet to the mysql server.\n\nThanks goes to the people who have contributed code to this module, see the GitHub Contributors page.\n\nAdditionally I'd like to thank the following people:\n• Andrey Hristov (Oracle) - for helping me with protocol questions.\n• Ulf Wendel (Oracle) - for helping me with protocol questions.\n\nThe following companies have supported this project financially, allowing me to spend more time on it (ordered by time of contribution):\n• Transloadit (my startup, we do file uploading & video encoding as a service, check it out)\n\nIf you'd like to discuss this module, or ask questions about it, please use one of the following:\n• IRC Channel: #node.js (on freenode.net, I pay attention to any message including the term )\n\nThe recommended way to establish a connection is this:\n\nHowever, a connection can also be implicitly established by invoking a query:\n\nDepending on how you like to handle your errors, either method may be appropriate. Any type of connection error (handshake or network) is considered a fatal error, see the Error Handling section for more information.\n\nWhen establishing a connection, you can set the following options:\n• : The hostname of the database you are connecting to. (Default: )\n• : The port number to connect to. (Default: )\n• : The source IP address to use for TCP connection. (Optional)\n• : The path to a unix domain socket to connect to. When used and are ignored.\n• : The MySQL user to authenticate as.\n• : The password of that MySQL user.\n• : Name of the database to use for this connection (Optional).\n• : The charset for the connection. This is called \"collation\" in the SQL-level of MySQL (like ). If a SQL-level charset is specified (like ) then the default collation for that charset is used. (Default: )\n• : The timezone configured on the MySQL server. This is used to type cast server date/time values to JavaScript object and vice versa. This can be , , or an offset in the form or . (Default: )\n• : The milliseconds before a timeout occurs during the initial connection to the MySQL server. (Default: )\n• : Stringify objects instead of converting to values. See issue #501. (Default: )\n• : Allow connecting to MySQL instances that ask for the old (insecure) authentication method. (Default: )\n• : Determines if column values should be converted to native JavaScript types. (Default: )\n• : When dealing with big numbers (BIGINT and DECIMAL columns) in the database, you should enable this option (Default: ).\n• : Enabling both and forces big numbers (BIGINT and DECIMAL columns) to be always returned as JavaScript String objects (Default: ). Enabling but leaving disabled will return big numbers as String objects only when they cannot be accurately represented with JavaScript Number objects (which happens when they exceed the [-2^53, +2^53] range), otherwise they will be returned as Number objects. This option is ignored if is disabled.\n• : Force date types (TIMESTAMP, DATETIME, DATE) to be returned as strings rather than inflated into JavaScript Date objects. Can be / or an array of type names to keep as strings. (Default: )\n• : Prints protocol details to stdout. Can be / or an array of packet type names that should be printed. (Default: )\n• : Generates stack traces on to include call site of library entrance (\"long stack traces\"). Slight performance penalty for most calls. (Default: )\n• : Allow to use the modifier. (Default: )\n• : Allow multiple mysql statements per query. Be careful with this, it could increase the scope of SQL injection attacks. (Default: )\n• : List of connection flags to use other than the default ones. It is also possible to blacklist default ones. For more information, check Connection Flags.\n• : object with ssl parameters or a string containing name of ssl profile. See SSL options.\n\nIn addition to passing these options as an object, you can also use a url string. For example:\n\nNote: The query values are first attempted to be parsed as JSON, and if that fails assumed to be plaintext strings.\n\nThe option in the connection options takes a string or an object. When given a string, it uses one of the predefined SSL profiles included. The following profiles are included:\n• : this profile is for connecting to an Amazon RDS server and contains the certificates from https://rds.amazonaws.com/doc/rds-ssl-ca-cert.pem and https://s3.amazonaws.com/rds-downloads/rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem\n\nWhen connecting to other servers, you will need to provide an object of options, in the same format as tls.createSecureContext. Please note the arguments expect a string of the certificate, not a file name to the certificate. Here is a simple example:\n\nYou can also connect to a MySQL server without properly providing the appropriate CA to trust. You should not do this.\n\nIf, for any reason, you would like to change the default connection flags, you can use the connection option . Pass a string with a comma separated list of items to add to the default flags. If you don't want a default flag to be used prepend the flag with a minus sign. To add a flag that is not in the default list, just write the flag name, or prefix it with a plus (case insensitive).\n\nThe following flags are available:\n• - Enable protocol compression. This feature is not currently supported by the Node.js implementation so cannot be turned on. (Default off)\n• - Ability to specify the database on connection. (Default on)\n• - Send the found rows instead of the affected rows as . (Default on)\n• - Don't issue SIGPIPE if network failures. This flag has no effect on this Node.js implementation. (Default on)\n• - Let the parser ignore spaces before the in queries. (Default on)\n• - Indicates to the MySQL server this is an \"interactive\" client. This will use the interactive timeouts on the MySQL server and report as interactive in the process list. (Default off)\n• - Can use . This flag is controlled by the connection option . (Default on)\n• - Use the improved version of Old Password Authentication. (Default on)\n• - Can handle multiple resultsets for queries. (Default on)\n• - The client may send multiple statement per query or statement prepare (separated by ). This flag is controlled by the connection option . (Default off)\n• Special handling of ODBC behaviour. This flag has no effect on this Node.js implementation. (Default on)\n• - Uses the plugin authentication mechanism when connecting to the MySQL server. This feature is not currently supported by the Node.js implementation so cannot be turned on. (Default off)\n• - Uses the 4.1 protocol. (Default on)\n• - Can handle multiple resultsets for execute. (Default on)\n• - This is specific to the C client, and has no effect on this Node.js implementation. (Default off)\n• - Old flag for the 4.1 protocol. (Default on)\n• - Use SSL after handshake to encrypt data in transport. This feature is controlled though the connection option, so the flag has no effect. (Default off)\n• - Verify the server certificate during SSL set up. This feature is controlled though the connection option, so the flag has no effect. (Default off)\n• - Asks for the transaction status flags. (Default on)\n\nThere are two ways to end a connection. Terminating a connection gracefully is done by calling the method:\n\nThis will make sure all previously enqueued queries are still before sending a packet to the MySQL server. If a fatal error occurs before the packet can be sent, an argument will be provided to the callback, but the connection will be terminated regardless of that.\n\nAn alternative way to end the connection is to call the method. This will cause an immediate termination of the underlying socket. Additionally guarantees that no more events or callbacks will be triggered for the connection.\n\nUnlike the method does not take a callback argument.\n\nRather than creating and managing connections one-by-one, this module also provides built-in connection pooling using . Read more about connection pooling.\n\nCreate a pool and use it directly:\n\nThis is a shortcut for the -> -> code flow. Using is useful to share connection state for subsequent queries. This is because two calls to may use two different connections and run in parallel. This is the basic structure:\n\nIf you would like to close the connection and remove it from the pool, use instead. The pool will create a new connection the next time one is needed.\n\nConnections are lazily created by the pool. If you configure the pool to allow up to 100 connections, but only ever use 5 simultaneously, only 5 connections will be made. Connections are also cycled round-robin style, with connections being taken from the top of the pool and returning to the bottom.\n\nWhen a previous connection is retrieved from the pool, a ping packet is sent to the server to check if the connection is still good.\n\nPools accept all the same options as a connection. When creating a new connection, the options are simply passed to the connection constructor. In addition to those options pools accept a few extras:\n• : The milliseconds before a timeout occurs during the connection acquisition. This is slightly different from , because acquiring a pool connection does not always involve making a connection. If a connection request is queued, the time the request spends in the queue does not count towards this timeout. (Default: )\n• : Determines the pool's action when no connections are available and the limit has been reached. If , the pool will queue the connection request and call it when one becomes available. If , the pool will immediately call back with an error. (Default: )\n• : The maximum number of connections to create at once. (Default: )\n• : The maximum number of connection requests the pool will queue before returning an error from . If set to , there is no limit to the number of queued connection requests. (Default: )\n\nThe pool will emit an event when a connection is acquired from the pool. This is called after all acquiring activity has been performed on the connection, right before the connection is handed to the callback of the acquiring code.\n\nThe pool will emit a event when a new connection is made within the pool. If you need to set session variables on the connection before it gets used, you can listen to the event.\n\nThe pool will emit an event when a callback has been queued to wait for an available connection.\n\nThe pool will emit a event when a connection is released back to the pool. This is called after all release activity has been performed on the connection, so the connection will be listed as free at the time of the event.\n\nClosing all the connections in a pool\n\nWhen you are done using the pool, you have to end all the connections or the Node.js event loop will stay active until the connections are closed by the MySQL server. This is typically done if the pool is used in a script or when trying to gracefully shutdown a server. To end all the connections in the pool, use the method on the pool:\n\nThe method takes an optional callback that you can use to know when all the connections are ended.\n\nOnce is called, and other operations can no longer be performed. Wait until all connections in the pool are released before calling . If you use the shortcut method , in place of → → , wait until it completes.\n\ncalls on every active connection in the pool. This queues a packet on the connection and sets a flag to prevent from creating new connections. All commands / queries already in progress will complete, but new commands won't execute.\n• : If , will attempt to reconnect when connection fails. (Default: )\n• : If connection fails, node's increases. When is greater than , remove a node in the . (Default: )\n• : If connection fails, specifies the number of milliseconds before another connection attempt will be made. If set to , then node will be removed instead and never re-used. (Default: )\n• : The default selector. (Default: )\n• : Select the first node available unconditionally.\n\nMySQL offers a changeUser command that allows you to alter the current user and other aspects of the connection without shutting down the underlying socket:\n\nThe available options for this feature are:\n• : The name of the new user (defaults to the previous one).\n• : The password of the new user (defaults to the previous one).\n• : The new charset (defaults to the previous one).\n• : The new database (defaults to the previous one).\n\nA sometimes useful side effect of this functionality is that this function also resets any connection state (variables, transactions, etc.).\n\nErrors encountered during this operation are treated as fatal connection errors by this module.\n\nYou may lose the connection to a MySQL server due to network problems, the server timing you out, the server being restarted, or crashing. All of these events are considered fatal errors, and will have the . See the Error Handling section for more information.\n\nRe-connecting a connection is done by establishing a new connection. Once terminated, an existing connection object cannot be re-connected by design.\n\nWith Pool, disconnected connections will be removed from the pool freeing up space for a new connection to be created on the next getConnection call.\n\nWith PoolCluster, disconnected connections will count as errors against the related node, incrementing the error code for that node. Once there are more than errors on a given node, it is removed from the cluster. When this occurs, the PoolCluster may emit a error if there are no longer any matching nodes for the pattern. The config can be set to restore offline nodes after a given timeout.\n\nThe most basic way to perform a query is to call the method on an object (like a , , or instance).\n\nThe simplest form of . is , where a SQL string is the first argument and the second is a callback:\n\nThe second form comes when using placeholder values (see escaping query values):\n\nThe third form comes when using various advanced options on the query, like escaping query values, joins with overlapping column names, timeouts, and type casting.\n\nNote that a combination of the second and third forms can be used where the placeholder values are passed as an argument and not in the options object. The argument will override the in the option object.\n\nIf the query only has a single replacement character ( ), and the value is not , , or an array, it can be passed directly as the second argument to :\n\nCaution These methods of escaping values only works when the NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES SQL mode is disabled (which is the default state for MySQL servers).\n\nIn order to avoid SQL Injection attacks, you should always escape any user provided data before using it inside a SQL query. You can do so using the , or methods:\n\nAlternatively, you can use characters as placeholders for values you would like to have escaped like this:\n\nMultiple placeholders are mapped to values in the same order as passed. For example, in the following query equals , equals , equals , and will be :\n\nThis looks similar to prepared statements in MySQL, however it really just uses the same method internally.\n\nCaution This also differs from prepared statements in that all are replaced, even those contained in comments and strings.\n\nDifferent value types are escaped differently, here is how:\n• Arrays are turned into list, e.g. turns into\n• Nested arrays are turned into grouped lists (for bulk inserts), e.g. turns into\n• Objects that have a method will have called and the returned value is used as the raw SQL.\n• Objects are turned into pairs for each enumerable property on the object. If the property's value is a function, it is skipped; if the property's value is an object, toString() is called on it and the returned value is used.\n• / are left as-is. MySQL does not support these, and trying to insert them as values will trigger MySQL errors until they implement support.\n\nThis escaping allows you to do neat things like this:\n\nAnd the method allows you to form complex queries with functions:\n\nTo generate objects with a method, the method can be used. This creates an object that will be left un-touched when using in a placeholder, useful for using functions as dynamic values:\n\nCaution The string provided to will skip all escaping functions when used, so be careful when passing in unvalidated input.\n\nIf you feel the need to escape queries by yourself, you can also use the escaping function directly:\n\nIf you can't trust an SQL identifier (database / table / column name) because it is provided by a user, you should escape it with , or like this:\n\nIt also supports adding qualified identifiers. It will escape both parts.\n\nIf you do not want to treat as qualified identifiers, you can set the second argument to in order to keep the string as a literal identifier:\n\nAlternatively, you can use characters as placeholders for identifiers you would like to have escaped like this:\n\nPlease note that this last character sequence is experimental and syntax might change\n\nWhen you pass an Object to or , is used to avoid SQL injection in object keys.\n\nYou can use mysql.format to prepare a query with multiple insertion points, utilizing the proper escaping for ids and values. A simple example of this follows:\n\nFollowing this you then have a valid, escaped query that you can then send to the database safely. This is useful if you are looking to prepare the query before actually sending it to the database. As mysql.format is exposed from SqlString.format you also have the option (but are not required) to pass in stringifyObject and timezone, allowing you provide a custom means of turning objects into strings, as well as a location-specific/timezone-aware Date.\n\nIf you prefer to have another type of query escape format, there's a connection configuration option you can use to define a custom format function. You can access the connection object if you want to use the built-in or any other connection function.\n\nHere's an example of how to implement another format:\n\nGetting the id of an inserted row\n\nIf you are inserting a row into a table with an auto increment primary key, you can retrieve the insert id like this:\n\nWhen dealing with big numbers (above JavaScript Number precision limit), you should consider enabling option to be able to read the insert id as a string, otherwise it will throw an error.\n\nThis option is also required when fetching big numbers from the database, otherwise you will get values rounded to hundreds or thousands due to the precision limit.\n\nGetting the number of affected rows\n\nYou can get the number of affected rows from an insert, update or delete statement.\n\nGetting the number of changed rows\n\nYou can get the number of changed rows from an update statement.\n\n\"changedRows\" differs from \"affectedRows\" in that it does not count updated rows whose values were not changed.\n\nYou can get the MySQL connection ID (\"thread ID\") of a given connection using the property.\n\nThe MySQL protocol is sequential, this means that you need multiple connections to execute queries in parallel. You can use a Pool to manage connections, one simple approach is to create one connection per incoming http request.\n\nSometimes you may want to select large quantities of rows and process each of them as they are received. This can be done like this:\n\nPlease note a few things about the example above:\n• Usually you will want to receive a certain amount of rows before starting to throttle the connection using . This number will depend on the amount and size of your rows.\n• / operate on the underlying socket and parser. You are guaranteed that no more events will fire after calling .\n• You MUST NOT provide a callback to the method when streaming rows.\n• The event will fire for both rows as well as OK packets confirming the success of a INSERT/UPDATE query.\n• It is very important not to leave the result paused too long, or you may encounter The time limit for this is determined by the net_write_timeout setting on your MySQL server.\n\nAdditionally you may be interested to know that it is currently not possible to stream individual row columns, they will always be buffered up entirely. If you have a good use case for streaming large fields to and from MySQL, I'd love to get your thoughts and contributions on this.\n\nThe query object provides a convenience method that wraps query events into a Readable Stream object. This stream can easily be piped downstream and provides automatic pause/resume, based on downstream congestion and the optional . The parameter of the stream is set to and cannot be changed (if you need a byte stream, you will need to use a transform stream, like objstream for example).\n\nFor example, piping query results into another stream (with a max buffer of 5 objects) is simply:\n\nSupport for multiple statements is disabled for security reasons (it allows for SQL injection attacks if values are not properly escaped). To use this feature you have to enable it for your connection:\n\nOnce enabled, you can execute multiple statement queries like any other query:\n\nAdditionally you can also stream the results of multiple statement queries:\n\nIf one of the statements in your query causes an error, the resulting Error object contains a property which tells you which statement caused it. MySQL will also stop executing any remaining statements when an error occurs.\n\nPlease note that the interface for streaming multiple statement queries is experimental and I am looking forward to feedback on it.\n\nYou can call stored procedures from your queries as with any other mysql driver. If the stored procedure produces several result sets, they are exposed to you the same way as the results for multiple statement queries.\n\nWhen executing joins, you are likely to get result sets with overlapping column names.\n\nBy default, node-mysql will overwrite colliding column names in the order the columns are received from MySQL, causing some of the received values to be unavailable.\n\nHowever, you can also specify that you want your columns to be nested below the table name like this:\n\nOr use a string separator to have your results merged.\n\nSimple transaction support is available at the connection level:\n\nPlease note that beginTransaction(), commit() and rollback() are simply convenience functions that execute the START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK commands respectively. It is important to understand that many commands in MySQL can cause an implicit commit, as described in the MySQL documentation\n\nA ping packet can be sent over a connection using the method. This method will send a ping packet to the server and when the server responds, the callback will fire. If an error occurred, the callback will fire with an error argument.\n\nEvery operation takes an optional inactivity timeout option. This allows you to specify appropriate timeouts for operations. It is important to note that these timeouts are not part of the MySQL protocol, and rather timeout operations through the client. This means that when a timeout is reached, the connection it occurred on will be destroyed and no further operations can be performed.\n\nThis module comes with a consistent approach to error handling that you should review carefully in order to write solid applications.\n\nMost errors created by this module are instances of the JavaScript Error object. Additionally they typically come with two extra properties:\n• : String, contains the MySQL server error symbol if the error is a MySQL server error (e.g. ), a Node.js error code if it is a Node.js error (e.g. ), or an internal error code (e.g. ).\n• : Number, contains the MySQL server error number. Only populated from MySQL server error.\n• : Boolean, indicating if this error is terminal to the connection object. If the error is not from a MySQL protocol operation, this property will not be defined.\n• : String, contains the full SQL of the failed query. This can be useful when using a higher level interface like an ORM that is generating the queries.\n• : String, contains the five-character SQLSTATE value. Only populated from MySQL server error.\n• : String, contains the message string that provides a textual description of the error. Only populated from MySQL server error.\n\nFatal errors are propagated to all pending callbacks. In the example below, a fatal error is triggered by trying to connect to an invalid port. Therefore the error object is propagated to both pending callbacks:\n\nNormal errors however are only delegated to the callback they belong to. So in the example below, only the first callback receives an error, the second query works as expected:\n\nLast but not least: If a fatal errors occurs and there are no pending callbacks, or a normal error occurs which has no callback belonging to it, the error is emitted as an event on the connection object. This is demonstrated in the example below:\n\nNote: events are special in node. If they occur without an attached listener, a stack trace is printed and your process is killed.\n\ntl;dr: This module does not want you to deal with silent failures. You should always provide callbacks to your method calls. If you want to ignore this advice and suppress unhandled errors, you can do this:\n\nThis module is exception safe. That means you can continue to use it, even if one of your callback functions throws an error which you're catching using 'uncaughtException' or a domain.\n\nFor your convenience, this driver will cast mysql types into native JavaScript types by default. The following mappings exist:\n• BIT (last byte will be filled with 0 bits as necessary)\n\nNote text in the binary character set is returned as , rather than a string.\n• TIME (could be mapped to Date, but what date would be set?)\n• GEOMETRY (never used those, get in touch if you do)\n\nIt is not recommended (and may go away / change in the future) to disable type casting, but you can currently do so on either the connection:\n\nOr on the query level:\n\nYou can also pass a function and handle type casting yourself. You're given some column information like database, table and name and also type and length. If you just want to apply a custom type casting to a specific type you can do it and then fallback to the default.\n\nThe function is provided two arguments and and is expected to return the value for the given field by invoking the parser functions through the object.\n\nThe argument is a object and contains data about the field that need to be parsed. The following are some of the properties on a object:\n• - a string of the database the field came from.\n• - a string of the table the field came from.\n• - a string of the field name.\n• - a string of the field type in all caps.\n• - a number of the field length, as given by the database.\n\nThe argument is a that, when called, will return the default type conversion for the given field.\n\nWhen getting the field data, the following helper methods are present on the object:\n• - parse the field as a geometry value.\n\nThe MySQL protocol is a text-based protocol. This means that over the wire, all field types are represented as a string, which is why only string-like functions are available on the object. Based on the type information (like ), the type cast should convert the string field into a different JavaScript type (like a ).\n\nHere's an example of converting to boolean:\n\nWARNING: YOU MUST INVOKE the parser using one of these three field functions in your custom typeCast callback. They can only be called once.\n\nIf you are running into problems, one thing that may help is enabling the mode for the connection:\n\nThis will print all incoming and outgoing packets on stdout. You can also restrict debugging to packet types by passing an array of types to debug:\n\nto restrict debugging to the query and data packets.\n\nIf that does not help, feel free to open a GitHub issue. A good GitHub issue will have:\n• The minimal amount of code required to reproduce the problem (if possible)\n• As much debugging output and information about your environment (mysql version, node version, os, etc.) as you can gather.\n\nSecurity issues should not be first reported through GitHub or another public forum, but kept private in order for the collaborators to assess the report and either (a) devise a fix and plan a release date or (b) assert that it is not a security issue (in which case it can be posted in a public forum, like a GitHub issue).\n\nThe primary private forum is email, either by emailing the module's author or opening a GitHub issue simply asking to whom a security issues should be addressed to without disclosing the issue or type of issue.\n\nAn ideal report would include a clear indication of what the security issue is and how it would be exploited, ideally with an accompanying proof of concept (\"PoC\") for collaborators to work against and validate potentional fixes against.\n\nThis project welcomes contributions from the community.

However, it requires an https-enabled website, i.e., HTTPS is necessary for secure cookies. If is set, and you access your site over HTTP, the cookie will not be set. If you have your node.js behind a proxy and are using , you need to set “trust proxy” in express:\n\nFor using secure cookies in production, but allowing for testing in development, the following is an example of enabling this setup based on in express:\n\nThe option can also be set to the special value to have this setting automatically match the determined security of the connection. Be careful when using this setting if the site is available both as HTTP and HTTPS, as once the cookie is set on HTTPS, it will no longer be visible over HTTP. This is useful when the Express setting is properly setup to simplify development vs production configuration.\n\nFunction to call to generate a new session ID.

Depending on your store this may be necessary, but it can also create race conditions where a client makes two parallel requests to your server and changes made to the session in one request may get overwritten when the other request ends, even if it made no changes (this behavior also depends on what store you’re using).\n\nThe default value is , but using the default has been deprecated, as the default will change in the future. Please research into this setting and choose what is appropriate to your use-case. Typically, you’ll want .\n\nHow do I know if this is necessary for my store? The best way to know is to check with your store if it implements the method. If it does, then you can safely set . If it does not implement the method and your store sets an expiration date on stored sessions, then you likely need .\n\nForce the session identifier cookie to be set on every response. The expiration is reset to the original , resetting the expiration countdown.\n\nThe default value is .\n\nWith this enabled, the session identifier cookie will expire in since the last response was sent instead of in since the session was last modified by the server.\n\nThis is typically used in conjuction with short, non-session-length values to provide a quick timeout of the session data with reduced potential of it occurring during on going server interactions.\n\nNote When this option is set to but the option is set to , the cookie will not be set on a response with an uninitialized session. This option only modifies the behavior when an existing session was loaded for the request.\n\nForces a session that is “uninitialized” to be saved to the store. A session is uninitialized when it is new but not modified. Choosing is useful for implementing login sessions, reducing server storage usage, or complying with laws that require permission before setting a cookie. Choosing will also help with race conditions where a client makes multiple parallel requests without a session.\n\nThe default value is , but using the default has been deprecated, as the default will change in the future. Please research into this setting and choose what is appropriate to your use-case.\n\nNote if you are using Session in conjunction with PassportJS, Passport will add an empty Passport object to the session for use after a user is authenticated, which will be treated as a modification to the session, causing it to be saved. This has been fixed in PassportJS 0.3.0\n\nThis is the secret used to sign the session ID cookie. The secret can be any type of value that is supported by Node.js (like a string or a ). This can be either a single secret, or an array of multiple secrets. If an array of secrets is provided, only the first element will be used to sign the session ID cookie, while all the elements will be considered when verifying the signature in requests. The secret itself should be not easily parsed by a human and would best be a random set of characters. A best practice may include:\n• The use of environment variables to store the secret, ensuring the secret itself does not exist in your repository.\n• Periodic updates of the secret, while ensuring the previous secret is in the array.\n\nUsing a secret that cannot be guessed will reduce the ability to hijack a session to only guessing the session ID (as determined by the option).\n\nChanging the secret value will invalidate all existing sessions. In order to rotate the secret without invalidating sessions, provide an array of secrets, with the new secret as first element of the array, and including previous secrets as the later elements.\n\nNote HMAC-256 is used to sign the session ID. For this reason, the secret should contain at least 32 bytes of entropy.\n\nThe session store instance, defaults to a new instance.\n\nControl the result of unsetting (through , setting to , etc.).\n\nThe default value is .\n• The session will be destroyed (deleted) when the response ends.\n• The session in the store will be kept, but modifications made during the request are ignored and not saved.\n\nTo store or access session data, simply use the request property , which is (generally) serialized as JSON by the store, so nested objects are typically fine. For example below is a user-specific view counter:\n\nTo regenerate the session simply invoke the method. Once complete, a new SID and instance will be initialized at and the will be invoked.\n\nDestroys the session and will unset the property. Once complete, the will be invoked.\n\nReloads the session data from the store and re-populates the object. Once complete, the will be invoked.\n\nSave the session back to the store, replacing the contents on the store with the contents in memory (though a store may do something else–consult the store’s documentation for exact behavior).\n\nThis method is automatically called at the end of the HTTP response if the session data has been altered (though this behavior can be altered with various options in the middleware constructor). Because of this, typically this method does not need to be called.\n\nThere are some cases where it is useful to call this method, for example, redirects, long-lived requests or in WebSockets.\n\nUpdates the property. Typically this is not necessary to call, as the session middleware does this for you.\n\nEach session has a unique ID associated with it. This property is an alias of and cannot be modified. It has been added to make the session ID accessible from the object.\n\nEach session has a unique cookie object accompany it. This allows you to alter the session cookie per visitor. For example we can set to to enable the cookie to remain for only the duration of the user-agent.\n\nAlternatively will return the time remaining in milliseconds, which we may also re-assign a new value to adjust the property appropriately. The following are essentially equivalent\n\nFor example when is set to (one minute), and 30 seconds has elapsed it will return until the current request has completed, at which time is called to reset to its original value.\n\nThe property returns the original (time-to-live), in milliseconds, of the session cookie.\n\nTo get the ID of the loaded session, access the request property . This is simply a read-only value set when a session is loaded/created.\n\nEvery session store must be an and implement specific methods. The following methods are the list of required, recommended, and optional.\n• Required methods are ones that this module will always call on the store.\n• Recommended methods are ones that this module will call on the store if available.\n• Optional methods are ones this module does not call at all, but helps present uniform stores to users.\n\nFor an example implementation view the connect-redis repo.\n\nThis optional method is used to get all sessions in the store as an array. The should be called as .\n\nThis required method is used to destroy/delete a session from the store given a session ID ( ). The should be called as once the session is destroyed.\n\nThis optional method is used to delete all sessions from the store. The should be called as once the store is cleared.\n\nThis optional method is used to get the count of all sessions in the store. The should be called as .\n\nThis required method is used to get a session from the store given a session ID ( ). The should be called as .\n\nThe argument should be a session if found, otherwise or if the session was not found (and there was no error). A special case is made when to act like .\n\nThis required method is used to upsert a session into the store given a session ID ( ) and session ( ) object. The callback should be called as once the session has been set in the store.\n\nThis recommended method is used to “touch” a given session given a session ID ( ) and session ( ) object. The should be called as once the session has been touched.\n\nThis is primarily used when the store will automatically delete idle sessions and this method is used to signal to the store the given session is active, potentially resetting the idle timer.\n\nThe following modules implement a session store that is compatible with this module.

        "document": "Session management is a crucial aspect of web application development, as it ensures that user data and preferences are stored securely and accurately. In this article, we will explore how to implement session management in Node.js applications.\n\nSession management is the process of managing user sessions within a web application. A session is a period of time in which a user interacts with an application, typically starting when the user logs in and ending when they log out. Session management ensures that user data, preferences, and session-related information are securely stored and managed.\n\nTo implement session management in Node.js applications, you need to use a session management middleware. A middleware is a function that sits between the client and the server, processing requests and responses.\n\nThe first step in implementing session management in Node.js applications is to install and configure the session middleware. There are several session middleware options available for Node.js, including , , and . You can install and configure these middleware options using .\n\nTo install express-session, we can run the following command:\n\n\n\nOnce installed, we can require it in our Node.js application and configure it as follows:\n\n\n\nIn the above code sample, we have initialized the express-session middleware with the following configuration options:\n• None secret: This option is used to set a secret key for the session. The secret key is used to sign the session ID cookie to prevent tampering.\n• None resave: This option determines whether the session should be saved to the store on every request. Setting this option to false can improve performance.\n• None saveUninitialized: This option determines whether to save uninitialized sessions. Setting this option to false can improve performance.\n\nOnce you have installed and configured the session middleware, the next step is to initialize it. Initialization involves creating a session object that stores user data and preferences. You can initialize the session middleware in your application's entry point, such as or .\n\n\n\nIn the above code sample, we have initialized the session middleware and accessed the session data using the object.\n\nThe session middleware stores session data in the server's memory or a separate session store, such as a Redis database. When a user logs in, the session middleware creates a session object and assigns it a unique ID. The session ID is then stored in a cookie on the user's browser. The session middleware uses the session ID to retrieve the session data from the server or session store.\n\n\n\nIn the above code sample, we have stored session data for an authenticated user using the object.\n\nTo ensure that session data is not stored indefinitely, it is essential to manage session timeouts. Session timeouts determine how long a session can remain idle before it is invalidated. You can set a timeout for a session by configuring the session middleware. When a session timeout occurs, the session middleware deletes the session data from the server or session store.\n\nWe can set the session timeout using the option when initializing the session middleware. The option is expressed in milliseconds and determines the maximum age of a session.\n\n\n\nIn the above code sample, we have set the session timeout to 60 seconds using the option.\n\nWhen a user logs out or the session expires, we need to destroy the session to ensure that session data is not stored indefinitely. We can destroy a session using the method.\n\n\n\nIn the above code sample, we have destroyed the session using the method.\n\nTo retrieve session data, we can access the object. The object is an object that contains session data.\n\n\n\nIn the above code sample, we have retrieved session data using the object.\n\nFinally, it is crucial to secure session data to prevent unauthorized access or tampering. You can secure session data by using secure cookies, encrypting session data, and implementing HTTPS encryption.\n\nSession management is a critical part of web application development. In this article, we have explored how to implement session management in Node.js applications using the express-session middleware. We have covered installing and configuring the session middleware, initializing the session middleware, storing session data, managing session timeouts, destroying sessions, and retrieving session data. By following the best practices outlined in this article, you can ensure that your Node.js applications are secure and reliable."

In this article, we will see the use of express-session middleware for session management in Express with practical implementation.\n\nThe express-session middleware allows the creation and storage of the session data used for authentication or user preferences. Using this middleware, we can properly maintain the stateful interaction between the Express.js server and the client. Using the sessions the security of the application is maintained and interaction with the user is increased.\n\nSteps to use express-session middleware in Express.js\n\nStep 1: In the first step, we will create the new folder by using the below command in the VS Code terminal.\n\nStep 2: After creating the folder, initialize the NPM using the below command. Using this the package.json file will be created.\n\nStep 3: Now, we will install the express dependency for our project using the below command.\n\nStep 4: As we need to use the express-session middleware, we need to install it using npm.
