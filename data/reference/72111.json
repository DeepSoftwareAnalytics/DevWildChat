        "document": "If your app has constraints not well-served by existing frameworks, you prefer to build your own framework, or you just want to learn the basics of a React app, you can build a React app from scratch.\n\nThese recommended frameworks support all the features you need to deploy and scale your app in production. They have integrated the latest React features and take advantage of React’s architecture.\n\nAll the frameworks on this page support client-side rendering (CSR), single-page apps (SPA), and static-site generation (SSG). These apps can be deployed to a CDN or static hosting service without a server. Additionally, these frameworks allow you to add server-side rendering on a per-route basis, when it makes sense for your use case. This allows you to start with a client-only app, and if your needs change later, you can opt-in to using server features on individual routes without rewriting your app. See your framework’s documentation for configuring the rendering strategy.\n\nNext.js’s App Router is a React framework that takes full advantage of React’s architecture to enable full-stack React apps.\n\nNext.js is maintained by Vercel. You can deploy a Next.js app to any Node.js or serverless hosting, or to your own server. Next.js also supports static export which doesn’t require a server. Vercel additionally provides opt-in paid cloud services.\n\nReact Router is the most popular routing library for React and can be paired with Vite to create a full-stack React framework. It emphasizes standard Web APIs and has several ready to deploy templates for various JavaScript runtimes and platforms.\n\nExpo is a React framework that lets you create universal Android, iOS, and web apps with truly native UIs. It provides an SDK for React Native that makes the native parts easier to use. To create a new Expo project, run:\n\nIf you’re new to Expo, check out the Expo tutorial.\n\nExpo is maintained by Expo (the company). Building apps with Expo is free, and you can submit them to the Google and Apple app stores without restrictions. Expo additionally provides opt-in paid cloud services.\n\nThere are other up-and-coming frameworks that are working towards our full stack React vision:\n• TanStack Start (Beta): TanStack Start is a full-stack React framework powered by TanStack Router. It provides a full-document SSR, streaming, server functions, bundling, and more using tools like Nitro and Vite.\n• RedwoodJS: Redwood is a full stack React framework with lots of pre-installed packages and configuration that makes it easy to build full-stack web applications.\n\nWhich features make up the React team’s full-stack architecture vision? Next.js’s App Router bundler fully implements the official React Server Components specification. This lets you mix build-time, server-only, and interactive components in a single React tree. For example, you can write a server-only React component as an function that reads from a database or from a file. Then you can pass data down from it to your interactive components: Next.js’s App Router also integrates data fetching with Suspense. This lets you specify a loading state (like a skeleton placeholder) for different parts of your user interface directly in your React tree: Server Components and Suspense are React features rather than Next.js features. However, adopting them at the framework level requires buy-in and non-trivial implementation work. At the moment, the Next.js App Router is the most complete implementation. The React team is working with bundler developers to make these features easier to implement in the next generation of frameworks.\n\nIf your app has constraints not well-served by existing frameworks, you prefer to build your own framework, or you just want to learn the basics of a React app, there are other options available for starting a React project from scratch.\n\nStarting from scratch gives you more flexibility, but does require that you make choices on which tools to use for routing, data fetching, and other common usage patterns. It’s a lot like building your own framework, instead of using a framework that already exists. The frameworks we recommend have built-in solutions for these problems.\n\nIf you want to build your own solutions, see our guide to build a React app from Scratch for instructions on how to set up a new React project starting with a built tool like Vite, Parcel, or RSbuild.\n\nIf you’re a framework author interested in being included on this page, please let us know."

For more information see the production build section.\n\nFor environments using Node, the easiest way to handle this would be to install serve and let it handle the rest:\n\nThe last command shown above will serve your static site on the port 3000. Like many of serve’s internal settings, the port can be adjusted using the or flags:\n\nRun this command to get a full list of the options available:\n\nYou don’t necessarily need a static server in order to run a Create React App project in production. It also works well when integrated into an existing server side app.\n\nHere’s a programmatic example using Node and Express:\n\nThe choice of your server software isn’t important either. Since Create React App is completely platform-agnostic, there’s no need to explicitly use Node.\n\nThe folder with static assets is the only output produced by Create React App.\n\nHowever this is not quite enough if you use client-side routing. Read the next section if you want to support URLs like in your single-page app.\n\nIf you use routers that use the HTML5 history API under the hood (for example, React Router with ), many static file servers will fail. For example, if you used React Router with a route for , the development server will respond to properly, but an Express serving a production build as above will not.\n\nThis is because when there is a fresh page load for a , the server looks for the file and does not find it. The server needs to be configured to respond to a request to by serving . For example, we can amend our Express example above to serve for any unknown paths:\n\nIf you’re using Apache HTTP Server, you need to create a file in the folder that looks like this:\n\nIt will get copied to the folder when you run .\n\nIf you’re using Apache Tomcat, you need to follow this Stack Overflow answer.\n\nNow requests to will be handled correctly both in development and in production.\n\nOn a production build, and when you've opted-in, a service worker will automatically handle all navigation requests, like for , by serving the cached copy of your . This service worker navigation routing can be configured or disabled by ing and then modifying the and options of the configuration.\n\nWhen users install your app to the homescreen of their device the default configuration will make a shortcut to . This may not work for client-side routers which expect the app to be served from . Edit the web app manifest at and change to match the required URL scheme, for example:\n\nBy default, Create React App produces a build assuming your app is hosted at the server root.\n\nTo override this, specify the in your , for example:\n\nThis will let Create React App correctly infer the root path to use in the generated HTML file.\n\nNote: If you are using , you can root s using the prop on any .\n\nIf you are not using the HTML5 history API or not using client-side routing at all, it is unnecessary to specify the URL from which your app will be served. Instead, you can put this in your :\n\nThis will make sure that all the asset paths are relative to . You will then be able to move your app from to or even without having to rebuild it.\n\nYou can create an arbitrary build environment by creating a custom file and loading it using env-cmd.\n\nFor example, to create a build environment for a staging environment:\n• Set environment variables as you would any other file (e.g. )\n• Add a new script to your , building with your new environment:\n\nNow you can run to build with the staging environment config. You can specify other environments in the same way.\n\nVariables in will be used as fallback because will always be set to for a build.\n\nThe AWS Amplify Console provides continuous deployment and hosting for modern web apps (single page apps and static site generators) with serverless backends. The Amplify Console offers globally available CDNs, custom domain setup, feature branch deployments, and password protection.\n• Login to the Amplify Console here.\n• Connect your Create React App repo and pick a branch. If you're looking for a Create React App+Amplify starter, try the create-react-app-auth-amplify starter that demonstrates setting up auth in 10 minutes with Create React App.\n• The Amplify Console automatically detects the build settings. Choose Next.\n\nIf the build succeeds, the app is deployed and hosted on a global CDN with an amplifyapp.com domain. You can now continuously deploy changes to your frontend or backend. Continuous deployment allows developers to deploy updates to their frontend and backend on every code commit to their Git repository.\n\nAzure Static Web Apps creates an automated build and deploy pipeline for your React app powered by GitHub Actions. Applications are geo-distributed by default with multiple points of presence. PR's are built automatically for staging environment previews.\n• Add in the details and connect to your GitHub repo.\n• Make sure the build folder is set correctly on the \"build\" tab and create the resource.\n\nAzure Static Web Apps will automatically configure a GitHub Action in your repo and begin the deployment.\n\nSee the Azure Static Web Apps documentation for more information on routing, APIs, authentication and authorization, custom domains and more.\n\nInstall the Firebase CLI if you haven’t already by running .

This is because when there is a fresh page load for a url like , where is a frontend route, the GitHub Pages server returns 404 because it knows nothing of . If you want to add a router to a project hosted on GitHub Pages, here are a couple of solutions:\n• You could switch from using HTML5 history API to routing with hashes. If you use React Router, you can switch to for this effect, but the URL will be longer and more verbose (for example, ). Read more about different history implementations in React Router.\n• Alternatively, you can use a trick to teach GitHub Pages to handle 404s by redirecting to your page with a custom redirect parameter. You would need to add a file with the redirection code to the folder before deploying your project, and you’ll need to add code handling the redirect parameter to . You can find a detailed explanation of this technique in this guide.\n\nIf, when deploying, you get /dev/tty: No such a device or address or a similar error, try the following:\n\nIf, when deploying, you get , try the following:\n\nUse the Heroku Buildpack for Create React App.\n\nYou can find instructions in Deploying React with Zero Configuration.\n\nSometimes works locally but fails during deploy via Heroku. Following are the most common cases.\n\nIf you get something like this:\n\nIt means you need to ensure that the lettercase of the file or directory you matches the one you see on your filesystem or on GitHub.\n\nThis is important because Linux (the operating system used by Heroku) is case sensitive. So and are two distinct directories and thus, even though the project builds locally, the difference in case breaks the statements on Heroku remotes.\n\nIf you exclude or ignore necessary files from the package you will see a error similar this one:\n\nIn this case, ensure that the file is there with the proper lettercase and that’s not ignored on your local or .\n\nTo do a manual deploy to Netlify’s CDN:\n\nChoose as the path to deploy.\n\nWith this setup Netlify will build and deploy when you push to git or open a pull request:\n• Pick your Git hosting service and select your repository\n\nTo support , make sure to create a file with the following rewrite rules:\n\nWhen you build the project, Create React App will place the folder contents into the build output.\n\nVercel is a cloud platform that enables developers to host Jamstack websites and web services that deploy instantly, scale automatically, and requires no supervision, all with zero configuration. They provide a global edge network, SSL encryption, asset compression, cache invalidation, and more.\n\nTo deploy your React project with a Vercel for Git Integration, make sure it has been pushed to a Git repository.\n\nImport the project into Vercel using the Import Flow. During the import, you will find all relevant options preconfigured for you with the ability to change as needed.\n\nAfter your project has been imported, all subsequent pushes to branches will generate Preview Deployments, and all changes made to the Production Branch (commonly \"master\" or \"main\") will result in a Production Deployment.\n\nOnce deployed, you will get a URL to see your app live, such as the following: https://create-react-app-example.vercel.app/.\n\nIf you want to use a Custom Domain with your Vercel deployment, you can Add or Transfer in your domain via your Vercel account Domain settings.\n\nTo add your domain to your project, navigate to your Project from the Vercel Dashboard. Once you have selected your project, click on the \"Settings\" tab, then select the Domains menu item. From your projects Domain page, enter the domain you wish to add to your project.\n\nOnce the domain has been added, you will be presented with different methods for configuring it.\n\nYou can deploy a fresh React project, with a Git repository set up for you, with the following Deploy Button:\n\nRender offers free static site hosting with fully managed SSL, a global CDN and continuous auto deploys from GitHub.\n\nDeploy your app in only a few minutes by following the Create React App deployment guide.\n\nUse invite code to sign up or use this link.\n\nSee this blog post on how to deploy your React app to Amazon Web Services S3 and CloudFront. If you are looking to add a custom domain, HTTPS and continuous deployment see this blog post.\n\nInstall the Surge CLI if you haven’t already by running . Run the command and log in you or create a new account.\n\nWhen asked about the project path, make sure to specify the folder, for example:\n\nNote that in order to support routers that use HTML5 API, you may want to rename the in your build folder to before deploying to Surge. This ensures that every URL falls back to that file.\n\nCreate React App doesn't provide any built-in functionality to publish a component to npm. If you're ready to extract a component from your project so other people can use it, we recommend moving it to a separate directory outside of your project and then using a tool like nwb to prepare it for publishing."

It uses webpack, Babel, ESLint, and other amazing projects, but provides a cohesive curated experience on top of them.\n• No Configuration Required: You don't need to configure anything. A reasonably good configuration of both development and production builds is handled for you so you can focus on writing code.\n• No Lock-In: You can “eject” to a custom setup at any time. Run a single command, and all the configuration and build dependencies will be moved directly into your project, so you can pick up right where you left off.\n\nYour environment will have everything you need to build a modern single-page React app:\n• Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.\n• Autoprefixed CSS, so you don’t need or other prefixes.\n• A build script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production, with hashes and sourcemaps.\n• An offline-first service worker and a web app manifest, meeting all the Progressive Web App criteria. (Note: Using the service worker is opt-in as of and higher)\n• Hassle-free updates for the above tools with a single dependency.\n\nCheck out this guide for an overview of how these tools fit together.\n\nThe tradeoff is that these tools are preconfigured to work in a specific way. If your project needs more customization, you can \"eject\" and customize it, but then you will need to maintain this configuration.\n• Creating examples with React for your libraries and components.\n\nHere are a few common cases where you might want to try something else:\n• If you want to try React without hundreds of transitive build tool dependencies, consider using a single HTML file or an online sandbox instead.\n• If you need to integrate React code with a server-side template framework like Rails, Django or Symfony, or if you’re not building a single-page app, consider using nwb, or Neutrino which are more flexible. For Rails specifically, you can use Rails Webpacker. For Symfony, try Symfony's webpack Encore.\n• If you need to publish a React component, nwb can also do this, as well as Neutrino's react-components preset.\n• If you want to do server rendering with React and Node.js, check out Next.js or Razzle. Create React App is agnostic of the backend, and only produces static HTML/JS/CSS bundles.\n• If your website is mostly static (for example, a portfolio or a blog), consider using Gatsby or Next.js. Unlike Create React App, Gatsby pre-renders the website into HTML at build time. Next.js supports both server rendering and pre-rendering.\n• Finally, if you need more customization, check out Neutrino and its React preset.\n\nAll of the above tools can work with little to no configuration.\n\nIf you prefer configuring the build yourself, follow this guide.\n\nLooking for something similar, but for React Native?\n\n Check out Expo CLI.\n\nWe'd love to have your helping hand on !

        "document": "React has become the go-to JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces. Whether you’re a seasoned developer or just starting, configuring your development environment for React is a crucial initial step to ensure a smooth development experience. In this comprehensive guide, we will walk you through each step in detail to set up your React development environment.\n\nBefore we start, let’s make sure you have all the necessary tools installed:\n\n1. Node.js and npm: React development relies heavily on Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). You can download and install them from the official website [here](https://nodejs.org/).\n\n2. Code Editor: Choose a code editor that suits your preferences. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom. You can download Visual Studio Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n\nThe easiest way to start with React is by using the official tool called Create React App. It simplifies the setup process and provides a pre-configured environment for React development. Open your terminal and execute the following command:\n\nReplace `my-react-app` with your desired project name. This command sets up a new React project with all the necessary configurations and dependencies.\n\nAfter running the previous command, you will have a new directory with your project’s name. To navigate to your project directory, use the following command:\n\nReplace `my-react-app` with your project name if it’s different.\n\nNow, let’s start the development server and see your React app in action. Run the following command:\n\nThis command starts a local development server and automatically opens your app in your default web browser. Any changes you make to your code will be instantly reflected in the browser.\n\nUnderstanding the project structure is essential for efficient development. React projects generated with Create React App have a predefined structure:\n\n- **src**: This directory contains your application’s source code.\n\n- **public**: Static assets and HTML files go here.\n\n- **node_modules**: All project dependencies are stored here.\n\n- **package.json**: This file lists your project’s dependencies and scripts.\n\n- **README.md**: Documentation for your project.\n\nDepending on your project requirements, you might need to install additional dependencies. Common ones include state management libraries like Redux or Mobx, routing libraries such as React Router, or UI component libraries like Material-UI or Ant Design. You can add these dependencies using npm or yarn:\n\nSetting up your development environment for React is the first and crucial step in building powerful web applications. Create React App simplifies this process, enabling you to start coding without getting bogged down by configuration. As you gain more experience, you can explore advanced configurations and libraries to tailor your environment to your specific needs.\n\nReact offers a vast ecosystem of tools and libraries that make it a versatile choice for building interactive and efficient user interfaces.

        "document": "If your app has constraints not well-served by existing frameworks, you prefer to build your own framework, or you just want to learn the basics of a React app, you can build a React app from scratch.\n\nThese recommended frameworks support all the features you need to deploy and scale your app in production. They have integrated the latest React features and take advantage of React’s architecture.\n\nAll the frameworks on this page support client-side rendering (CSR), single-page apps (SPA), and static-site generation (SSG). These apps can be deployed to a CDN or static hosting service without a server. Additionally, these frameworks allow you to add server-side rendering on a per-route basis, when it makes sense for your use case. This allows you to start with a client-only app, and if your needs change later, you can opt-in to using server features on individual routes without rewriting your app. See your framework’s documentation for configuring the rendering strategy.\n\nNext.js’s App Router is a React framework that takes full advantage of React’s architecture to enable full-stack React apps.\n\nNext.js is maintained by Vercel. You can deploy a Next.js app to any Node.js or serverless hosting, or to your own server. Next.js also supports static export which doesn’t require a server. Vercel additionally provides opt-in paid cloud services.\n\nReact Router is the most popular routing library for React and can be paired with Vite to create a full-stack React framework. It emphasizes standard Web APIs and has several ready to deploy templates for various JavaScript runtimes and platforms.\n\nExpo is a React framework that lets you create universal Android, iOS, and web apps with truly native UIs. It provides an SDK for React Native that makes the native parts easier to use. To create a new Expo project, run:\n\nIf you’re new to Expo, check out the Expo tutorial.\n\nExpo is maintained by Expo (the company). Building apps with Expo is free, and you can submit them to the Google and Apple app stores without restrictions. Expo additionally provides opt-in paid cloud services.\n\nThere are other up-and-coming frameworks that are working towards our full stack React vision:\n• TanStack Start (Beta): TanStack Start is a full-stack React framework powered by TanStack Router. It provides a full-document SSR, streaming, server functions, bundling, and more using tools like Nitro and Vite.\n• RedwoodJS: Redwood is a full stack React framework with lots of pre-installed packages and configuration that makes it easy to build full-stack web applications.\n\nWhich features make up the React team’s full-stack architecture vision? Next.js’s App Router bundler fully implements the official React Server Components specification. This lets you mix build-time, server-only, and interactive components in a single React tree. For example, you can write a server-only React component as an function that reads from a database or from a file. Then you can pass data down from it to your interactive components: Next.js’s App Router also integrates data fetching with Suspense. This lets you specify a loading state (like a skeleton placeholder) for different parts of your user interface directly in your React tree: Server Components and Suspense are React features rather than Next.js features. However, adopting them at the framework level requires buy-in and non-trivial implementation work. At the moment, the Next.js App Router is the most complete implementation. The React team is working with bundler developers to make these features easier to implement in the next generation of frameworks.\n\nIf your app has constraints not well-served by existing frameworks, you prefer to build your own framework, or you just want to learn the basics of a React app, there are other options available for starting a React project from scratch.\n\nStarting from scratch gives you more flexibility, but does require that you make choices on which tools to use for routing, data fetching, and other common usage patterns. It’s a lot like building your own framework, instead of using a framework that already exists. The frameworks we recommend have built-in solutions for these problems.\n\nIf you want to build your own solutions, see our guide to build a React app from Scratch for instructions on how to set up a new React project starting with a built tool like Vite, Parcel, or RSbuild.\n\nIf you’re a framework author interested in being included on this page, please let us know."

        "document": "Setting up a React environment involves installing Node.js, npm (Node Package Manager), and using Create React App, which is a tool that sets up a new React project with a good default configuration. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you set up your React environment:\n\n- Download the recommended version for your operating system.\n\n- Follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system.\n\n- Run the following commands to check if Node.js and npm are installed:\n\n- The commands should print the installed versions of Node.js and npm.\n\n- Run the following command to install Create React App globally:\n\n- Choose or create a directory where you want to create your React project.\n\n- Open a command prompt or terminal in that directory.\n\n- Run the following command to create a new React app (replace “my-react-app” with your desired project name):\n\n- Once inside your project directory, run the following command to start the development server:\n\n- Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).\n\n- You should see your new React app running.\n\nCongratulations! You’ve successfully set up a React environment using Node.js, npm, and Create React App. Now you can start building your React applications. Keep in mind that Create React App abstracts away the configuration details, making it easier to focus on coding your React components."
