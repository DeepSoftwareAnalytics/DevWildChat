This feature works with the latest versions of: When you turn on voice typing or captions, your web browser controls the speech-to-text service. It determines how your speech is processed and then sends the text to Google Docs or Google Slides. Tip: If this feature is not enabled in your organization, it may have been turned off by your administrator.\n\nTo use voice typing or voice commands, your computer microphone needs to be on and working. Devices and microphones vary, so check your computer manual for instructions. Typically, microphone settings are in the System Settings on a Mac, or the Control Panel on a PC.\n\nAfter you start voice typing, you can use commands to edit and format your document. For example, \"Select paragraph,\" \"italics,\" or \"Go to the end of the line.\"\n\nTip: The colors available are: red, red berry, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, cornflower blue, purple, magenta, black, white, and gray. For all colors except black and white, you can add \"light\" or \"dark\" along with numbers 1-3 (for gray, 1-4), such as \"dark purple 3.\" If you say \"highlight\" by itself, the highlighting color is yellow. To select text, you can use these commands:\n\nTo move the cursor to the end of the paragraph and start voice typing again, say \"Resume.\" To move the cursor to the end of a particular word or phrase, say \"Resume with [word or phrase].\" Here are all the commands you can say to resume voice typing:\n• Go to the end of the paragraph\n• Move to the end of the paragraph\n• Go to the end of the line\n• Move to the end of the line\n\nIf voice typing isn't working, try these steps."

        "document": "In our fast-paced digital world, productivity and efficiency are paramount. Over the last few decades, digital developers have taken great pains in every industry to streamline the processes and platforms most professionals engage with every day. Word processing is one such activity, and thanks to these efforts and improvements in technology, using this technology is now faster, easier and more convenient.\n\nStreamlined workflows, enhanced functionality and AI-powered tools all make word processors like Google Docs invaluable resources for professionals, educators and students. Speech-to-text is just one of the advanced features that makes Google’s word-processing platform accessible and convenient. In this blog, we will cover everything you need to know about using speech-to-text in Google Docs and discuss how to make the most of this productivity-boosting tool.\n\nSpeech-to-text tools like Google’s rely on a sophisticated form of artificial intelligence. Automatic speech recognition technology or ASR uses advanced language learning models to recognize and interpret human speech. This technology powers various devices and programs many interact with daily. For example, ASR is the foundational technology behind virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, which interpret and respond to verbal commands.\n\nAutomatic speech recognition technology is constantly learning and evolving. However, it’s essential to understand that AI-powered speech-to-text and voice recognition tools may not always offer the most accurate solution for consumers. If your project demands a high level of accuracy, or if you want to incorporate speech-to-text technology into your workflows for accessibility purposes, you may want to opt for alternative solutions, including those that involve a human layer of editing and quality control.\n\nBefore using Google’s speech-to-text tool, you’ll need to make sure your device, system and settings are up to the task. You will need to download the most recent version of Google Chrome to enable the voice typing feature on Google Docs. Also, ensure that you have a fully functional microphone connected to your computer. Finally, you’ll want to select your microphone as your audio input device. You can check and adjust your microphone in your computer’s sound settings menu.\n\nOnce all of your hardware and settings are ready, it’s time to enable the speech-to-text feature in Google Docs. To do this, take the following steps:\n• Step 1: Open Google Docs in your web browser. If you don’t have a Google account, you’ll need to create one to proceed.\n• Step 2: Select Tools from the menu bar. A drop-down menu will appear.\n• Step 4: Enable microphone access by clicking the microphone icon in the voice typing toolbar and allowing the necessary permissions.\n• Step 5: Choose your preferred language from the language options provided.\n\nAfter you enable the voice typing feature, you can verbally dictate the text you want to type rather than typing it by hand. Next, Google’s ASR algorithm will process the audio input and convert your spoken language into written text.\n\nIn addition to taking standard dictation, Google’s speech-to-text algorithm also supports several voice commands that users can take advantage of while creating their documents. Some of these commands include:\n\nGoogle Docs even allows users to take advantage of advanced voice commands to complete more technical processes like inserting tables, modifying table structure, applying subheadings, and selecting specific text within a document. These commands make it fast and easy for users to create and edit text documents without needing to be hands-on throughout the process.\n\nSince Google’s speech-to-text tool relies on artificial intelligence, it is subject to certain limitations. To have the best possible voice typing experience, users should safeguard against certain environmental and practical factors that could prevent the technology from doing its job properly.\n\nWhen voice typing, you’ll want to ensure you are working in an area free from background noise. You also want to check that your microphone is in good working order and position it to pick up the audio input easily. The more clearly you speak, the more accurate your results will be. Speaking at a natural pace and volume can further help the computer pick up on the nuances in your speech. If you or the computer make an error during the voice typing process, you can easily use the “Undo” voice command to delete the previous word or phrase and replace it with the corrected version.\n\nGoogle’s speech-to-text feature can benefit Google Docs users in various ways. Some of the key benefits of this technology include:\n• Enhanced Productivity: Manually typing and editing text documents can be laborious and time-consuming. Voice typing makes word processing faster, easier and more convenient. As a result, it can reduce the amount of time associated with these processes.\n• Reduced Physical Strain: Manually typing for extended periods can lead to substantial strain on workers’ hands, wrists, necks and shoulders. Voice typing can ease some of this and reduce the incidence of repetitive strain injuries among frequent computer users.\n• Improved Accessibility: Workers of all backgrounds and abilities can benefit from speech-to-text technology. In addition to supporting the needs of workers with mobility-related disabilities, voice typing can serve as a valuable tool for individuals who are blind or have low vision. Also, individuals with temporary injuries or who are recovering from wrist or hand surgery can use this feature when typing isn’t an option.\n\nVoice Typing is a Useful Tool for Anyone Engaged in Word Processing\n\nVoice typing can be an incredibly valuable resource for workers in fast-paced environments. Speech-to-text tools can make quick work of note-taking and record-keeping and ease the physical strain associated with manual typing and word processing. Whether you’re looking to transcribe a conference call or dictate the first draft of an important email, Google’s voice typing feature might be the solution you’ve been looking for.\n\nTo learn more about the benefits of ASR-powered technology solutions or for a more accurate alternative to Google’s speech-to-text tool, the Verbit team is here to help. We offer tailor-made assistive technology solutions that are easy-to-use, cost-effective and accurate enough to support modern accessibility standards.

        "document": "Are you tired of or not fond of typing? Are you suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome or repetitive strain injury but you need to type? Use Google docs for Google speech to text conversion. It allows you to dictate using your voice with your computer’s microphone and then Google docs converts your voice to text.\n\nNow if you’re wondering how to convert Google speech to text using Google voice typing in Google docs, we’re here to help. Keep reading and discover how fun and easy it is to use this feature for transcription.\n\n[Quick note: Voice typing will only work in the speaker notes of Google Slides and Google Docs and only in the Chrome browser.]\n\n· Voice typing only works in Google Slides and Google Docs and with a Chrome browser.\n\n· Some aspects, such as voice commands for punctuation and editing, for instance, aren’t available in all languages.\n\n· To use voice typing, you need a working microphone.\n\n· To use Google speech to text in Docs, turn on voice typing, find and click the microphone icon, and then start dictating using your microphone.\n\nGoogle Speech to Text: How to Activate Voice Typing in Google Docs\n\nGoogle speech to text? Save effort and time with voice typing in Google Docs instead of typing manually. Especially if you’re someone who wants to share your ideas quickly while also keeping your train of thought organized, you should use it. Check out this tutorial.\n\nBefore you can use the voice typing feature of Google docs for transcription, check your computer’s microphone. It should be properly installed and it should be working.\n\nNote that microphones and devices vary. Check for instructions in your computer manual. You’ll typically find the microphone settings in the control panel of your PC or system preferences on Mac.\n\nOnce done, open your Chrome browser and then Google Docs. You might also want to type docs.new from the address bar to open a new document.\n\nGoogle Speech to Text: How to enable voice typing in Google Docs\n\nIt is easy to enable voice typing in Google Docs. Just follow these steps:\n\n1. Activate voice typing by following this path: Tools>Voice Typing.\n\nA little note: If you’re using this feature for the first time, allow Chrome to use your microphone.\n\nSo, a microphone icon will appear on the screen. This is what you’ll press when you’re ready to transcribe. You can click and drag the window if you need to move the tool anywhere on your screen.\n\nFrom the Language drop-down, choose your language. There are over 100 dialects and languages to choose from and use.\n\nOnce you’re done choosing a language, start dictating so that Google, in real-time, can start transcribing the audio file.\n\nClick the three dots if voice typing doesn’t load your language immediately.\n\nNow you’re ready! Start speaking at your usual pace and volume. This will allow the tool to understand what you want it to type for you. You should speak clearly so that it will transcribe correctly.\n\nIf you can spot mistakes in your doc because the tool cannot recognize what you’re saying, check that you have chosen the right dialect in “Languages.”\n\nWhen you’re done speaking, click the microphone icon again. And to stop Google from picking up words, say “Stop listening.”\n\n[Before using the voice typing feature in Google Docs, check if your language/accent is available.]\n\nThe voice to text feature will be more accurate if you’re not heavily accented.\n\nHaving trouble? You might want to speak in your language and just use “Translate” later. You can speak in your preferred language and simply edit your document once done. However, it might not be a good option if you’re in a hurry.\n\nGoogle Speech to Text: How to Fix Mistakes\n\nIf you need to correct a mistake while typing with your voice, you can easily do it by moving the cursor to the error and then fixing it. You don’t need to turn the microphone off to do this.\n\nOnce done, move the cursor back to the spot where to continue. You can also check Google’s suggestions by right-clicking the words, which are underlined in gray color.\n\nGoogle Speech to Text: How to add punctuation\n\nIf you need to add punctuations in your text, you don’t have to worry because it’s a cinch. However, punctuation might only be available in languages, such as English, German, Spanish, Russian, French, and Italian. A few voice commands available include –\n\nGoogle Speech to Text: How to Use Voice Commands while Voice Typing\n\nDo you need to edit and format your text without clicking anything?\n\nGoogle’s voice typing makes this possible. With it, you don’t just type words, add punctuation, and so on, but you can easily format as well as edit your text right inside Google docs.\n\nIn Google Docs, take note that voice commands are only in English. You cannot use voice commands in Google Slides speaker notes. The document’s language as well as the account must also be in English.\n\nVoice commands allow you to be more productive, save time, and make use of more voice typing features in Docs. A few examples of commands for editing and formatting text include the following –\n\n· Say backspace or delete to remove a word/s if you say something that you don’t want included in the document.\n\n· Need to select text? Say [word or phrase]\n\n· Do you want to select all matching text? Say “select all matching text”\n\nThere is a huge list of voice commands to use while voice typing. To see the full list, click the question mark in the microphone’s window or just say “voice commands list.”\n\nSometimes, it is unavoidable to encounter issues while using voice typing in Google docs. Try the following for basic troubleshooting.\n\n· If you see the error message “We’re having trouble hearing you,” find and transfer to a quiet room. Try using an external microphone and adjust its volume.\n\n· Microphone not working? You might also encounter this issue when using Google speech to text. When you do, check that your microphone is not damaged or broken.\n\nOpen the microphone settings in your computer. Then, check that the microphone is properly plugged in or is not used by another application other than the voice typing feature in Google Docs. Next, restart your PC and check if the microphone is working, and then continue dictating.\n\n· Voice commands not working? Speak at a slower pace and with a louder and clearer voice. Before and after every command, pause. The microphone will show a bubble with the command. Check that Docs picked up the correct command. You can say “undo” if not.\n\nUse GoTranscript.com for Your Transcription Needs\n\nWe’re one of the leading human-based transcription services in the world that businesses, enterprises, and individuals have been using for accurate transcription.

        "document": "In this blog post, we will dive into episode two of my OneNote series. In the previous episode, we covered the basics of creating a OneNote and its functionalities. Now, we will go a little bit further and explore the exciting features of inserting text, audio, tables, and videos into your OneNote notebooks.\n\nOneNote provides a seamless experience for adding text to your notebooks. Whether you are creating a course outline, taking notes, or jotting down ideas, the process is simple and familiar. Just like in a Word document, you can format your text, add bullet points, and highlight important information. Right-clicking on the text gives you quick access to additional formatting options. OneNote empowers you to organize and structure your content, just the way you like it.\n\nOneNote is not limited to just typing. With the drawing features, you can unleash your creativity directly within your notebook. Whether you have a tablet device or a laptop with a stylus, the drawing experience in OneNote is fantastic. Choose from various pens, pencils, and highlighters to create beautiful illustrations or diagrams. The undo option is available if you make any mistakes. OneNote even recognizes your handwriting and can convert it into text, making it convenient for those with a less-than-perfect handwriting.\n\nVisuals enhance the overall experience and make your notes more engaging. OneNote allows you to easily insert images into your notebooks. You have multiple options to add images, including choosing from files on your device, capturing images with your camera, or searching for images online using the integrated Bing search. Once added, you can resize and move the images around, giving you the flexibility to create visually appealing pages.\n\nOneNote's audio recording feature is an incredible tool for collaboration and quick note-taking. With just a few clicks, you can start recording audio, whether it be a lecture, a meeting, or your own voice notes. This feature is especially useful for teachers who want to provide additional instructions or explanations to their students. You can also insert existing audio files into your notebooks, further enriching the content.\n\nAdding videos to your OneNote notebooks is a breeze. You can either select videos from your own files or choose online videos, which can be sourced from platforms like YouTube. By inserting videos, you can create interactive and engaging content for your audience. OneNote allows you to play the videos directly within the notebook or open them in the associated online platforms.\n\nWhen it comes to presenting organized data, OneNote's table feature comes in handy. You can easily create tables with customizable sizes and add data to them. Tables are perfect for keeping track of student information, project milestones, research data, or any other structured information you may need. OneNote provides options to format and manipulate tables according to your requirements.\n\nIn this blog post, we explored the powerful features of OneNote for inserting text, audio, tables, and videos into your notebooks. OneNote's versatility allows you to create visually appealing and interactive content, making it a valuable tool for note-taking, presentations, and collaborations. Whether you are a student, a professional, or an educator, OneNote empowers you to organize and express your ideas in a flexible and creative manner.\n\nStay tuned for more episodes in our OneNote series, where we will delve deeper into the advanced features and functionalities that make OneNote an invaluable companion.\n\n\n\nDon't forget to subscribe to our channel for updates on future videos, and if you're interested in partnering with us for training on OneNote and various other technologies like Power BI, Power Apps, Azure, and SQL, Don't forget to check out the Pragmatic Works' on-demand learning platform for more insightful content and training sessions.
