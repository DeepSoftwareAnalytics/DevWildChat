        "document": "Basically, all I want is have the scanner read an input for the username, and assign the input to a String variable.\n\nHow could I read input from the console using the Scanner class? Something like this:\n• None is synchronized, so read operations on a BufferedReader can be safely done from multiple threads. The buffer size may be specified, or the default size(8192) may be used. The default is large enough for most purposes. readLine() « just reads data line by line from the stream or source. A line is considered to be terminated by any one these: \n\n, \\r (or) \\r\n• None breaks its input into tokens using a delimiter pattern, which by default matches whitespace(\\s) and it is recognised by . « Until the user enters data, the scanning operation may block, waiting for input. « Use Scanner(BUFFER_SIZE = 1024) if you want to parse a specific type of token from a stream. « A scanner however is not thread safe. It has to be externally synchronized. next() « Finds and returns the next complete token from this scanner. nextInt() « Scans the next token of the input as an int. String name = null; int number; java.io.BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in)); name = in.readLine(); // If the user has not entered anything, assume the default value. number = Integer.parseInt(in.readLine()); // It reads only String,and we need to parse it. System.out.println(\"Name \" + name + \"\\t number \" + number); java.util.Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in).useDelimiter(\"\\\\s\"); name = sc.next(); // It will not leave until the user enters data. number = sc.nextInt(); // We can read specific data. System.out.println(\"Name \" + name + \"\\t number \" + number); // The Console class is not working in the IDE as expected. java.io.Console cnsl = System.console(); if (cnsl != null) { // Read a line from the user input. The cursor blinks after the specified input. name = cnsl.readLine(\"Name: \"); System.out.println(\"Name entered: \" + name); }\n\nThere are several ways to get input from the user. Here in this program we will take the Scanner class to achieve the task. This Scanner class comes under , hence the first line of the program is import java.util.Scanner; which allows the user to read values of various types in Java. The import statement line should have to be in the first line the java program, and we proceed further for code. in.nextInt(); // It just reads the numbers in.nextLine(); // It get the String which user enters To access methods in the Scanner class create a new scanner object as \"in\". Now we use one of its method, that is \"next\". The \"next\" method gets the string of text that a user enters on the keyboard. Here I'm using to get the String which the user enters. import java.util.Scanner; class GetInputFromUser { public static void main(String args[]) { int a; float b; String s; Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in); System.out.println(\"Enter a string\"); s = in.nextLine(); System.out.println(\"You entered string \" + s); System.out.println(\"Enter an integer\"); a = in.nextInt(); System.out.println(\"You entered integer \" + a); System.out.println(\"Enter a float\"); b = in.nextFloat(); System.out.println(\"You entered float \" + b); } }\n\nYou can make a simple program to ask for the user's name and print whatever the reply use inputs. Or ask the user to enter two numbers and you can add, multiply, subtract, or divide those numbers and print the answers for user inputs just like the behavior of a calculator. So there you need the Scanner class. You have to , and in the code you need to use: Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); System.out.println(\"Please enter your name: \"); s = input.next(); // Getting a String value System.out.println(\"Please enter your age: \"); i = input.nextInt(); // Getting an integer System.out.println(\"Please enter your salary: \"); d = input.nextDouble(); // Getting a double See how this differs: , , According to a String, int and a double varies the same way for the rest. Don't forget the import statement at the top of your code.\n\nThere is a simple way to read from the console. Please find the below code: import java.util.Scanner; public class ScannerDemo { public static void main(String[] args) { Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); // Reading of Integer int number = sc.nextInt(); // Reading of String String str = sc.next(); } } For a detailed understanding, please refer to the below documents. Now let's talk about the detailed understanding of the Scanner class working: This is the constructor for creating the Scanner instance. Here we are passing the reference which is nothing but a . Here it opens the Pipe for console input. public InputStreamReader(InputStream in) { super(in); try { sd = StreamDecoder.forInputStreamReader(in, this, (String)null); // ## Check lock object } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) { // The default encoding should always be available throw new Error(e); } } By passing the System.in this code will opens the socket for reading from console.\n\nthis is wrong method, you have to make an integer or a string, i would like to prefer string, and then give a string any name that can be i that can be n or anything else, remember that you are giving name to username you can also give name username also, and the code is"

It provides methods to read various kinds of inputs from the user, and also detect if the input is valid.\n\nTo read user input from the console, import the class from the package and initialize a object with the value of . At the end of our program, we should close the object by calling the method.\n\nThe class provides a variety of methods to read different kinds of user input. For example, we can read a line of input as a string using the method. An example is shown below:\n\nHere's the output of the following program. We've entered \"John Smith\" as the user input in this example:\n\nSimilarly, we can use to read an integer from the user. An example is shown below:\n\nThe output of the program is given below. We've entered 123 as the input in this case:\n\nThe method in the class is useful when you want to read a string from the user, but only up to the nearest whitespace character (spaces, tabs or newlines, i.e. the enter key). So, for example, if you want to read in the first and last name of a user, you can do something like this:\n\nThe output of the program demonstrates that and are stored separately:\n\nEven if all the input is typed in at once, the method will return each space-separated string one at a time. Here, even though we've typed \"John Smith\" in the same line, they are separated by spaces and so, is set to \"John\" and is set to \"Smith\".\n\nSometimes we may want to ensure that the input is valid before proceeding further. The class provides methods such as and to detect if the user has typed a valid string or integer before continuing.\n\nFor example, we can use to check if the user has entered a valid number and if not, we can take suitable action such as printing an error message.\n\nIf we enter an invalid number when running this program, it will print \"You did not enter a number\", as demonstrated below:\n\nHowever, when we have a lot of inputs to take, we would have to add an statement before taking each input, making our program long and complex. To avoid this scenario, the methods of the class throw a (or a subclass type such as ) if the entered input cannot be processed correctly.\n\nThis exception can be handled with a try/catch block, simplifying the process of error handling. We can rewrite the above program by using exception handling as shown below:\n\nThe data types and the corresponding methods of the class to read a particular data type, as well as detect if an input is of the valid data type, are given below:\n\nThe list of all methods in the class can be found in the Java documentation."

The resulting tokens may then be converted into values of different types using the various methods.\n\nFor example, this code allows a user to read a number from :\n\nAs another example, this code allows types to be assigned from entries in a file :\n\nThe scanner can also use delimiters other than whitespace. This example reads several items in from a string:\n\nThe same output can be generated with this code, which uses a regular expression to parse all four tokens at once:\n\nThe default whitespace delimiter used by a scanner is as recognized by . . The method will reset the value of the scanner's delimiter to the default whitespace delimiter regardless of whether it was previously changed.\n\nThe and methods and their primitive-type companion methods (such as and ) first skip any input that matches the delimiter pattern, and then attempt to return the next token. Both and methods may block waiting for further input. Whether a method blocks has no connection to whether or not its associated method will block.\n\nThe , , and methods operate independently of the delimiter pattern. These methods will attempt to match the specified pattern with no regard to delimiters in the input and thus can be used in special circumstances where delimiters are not relevant. These methods may block waiting for more input.\n\nWhen a scanner throws an , the scanner will not pass the token that caused the exception, so that it may be retrieved or skipped via some other method.\n\nDepending upon the type of delimiting pattern, empty tokens may be returned. For example, the pattern will return no empty tokens since it matches multiple instances of the delimiter. The delimiting pattern could return empty tokens since it only passes one space at a time.\n\nA scanner can read text from any object which implements the interface. If an invocation of the underlying readable's method throws an then the scanner assumes that the end of the input has been reached. The most recent thrown by the underlying readable can be retrieved via the method.\n\nWhen a is closed, it will close its input source if the source implements the interface.\n\nA is not safe for multithreaded use without external synchronization.\n\nUnless otherwise mentioned, passing a parameter into any method of a will cause a to be thrown.\n\nA scanner will default to interpreting numbers as decimal unless a different radix has been set by using the method. The method will reset the value of the scanner's radix to regardless of whether it was previously changed.\n\nAn instance of this class is capable of scanning numbers in the standard formats as well as in the formats of the scanner's locale. A scanner's initial locale is the value returned by the method; it may be changed via the method. The method will reset the value of the scanner's locale to the initial locale regardless of whether it was previously changed.\n\nThe localized formats are defined in terms of the following parameters, which for a particular locale are taken from that locale's object, , and its and object, .\n\nThe strings that can be parsed as numbers by an instance of this class are specified in terms of the following regular-expression grammar, where Rmax is the highest digit in the radix being used (for example, Rmax is 9 in base 10).\n\nWhitespace is not significant in the above regular expressions."

Otherwise, a object is returned that represents a character sequence that is the concatenation of the character sequence represented by this object and the character sequence represented by the argument string. - the that is concatenated to the end of this . a string that represents the concatenation of this object's characters followed by the string argument's characters.\n• in this string with . Returns a string resulting from replacing all occurrences ofin this string with If the character does not occur in the character sequence represented by this object, then a reference to this object is returned. Otherwise, a object is returned that represents a character sequence identical to the character sequence represented by this object, except that every occurrence of is replaced by an occurrence of . \"mesquite in your cellar\".replace('e', 'o') returns \"mosquito in your collar\" \"the war of baronets\".replace('r', 'y') returns \"the way of bayonets\" \"sparring with a purple porpoise\".replace('p', 't') returns \"starring with a turtle tortoise\" \"JonL\".replace('q', 'x') returns \"JonL\" (no change) a string derived from this string by replacing every occurrence of with .\n• Tells whether or not this string matches the given regular expression An invocation of this method of the form str regex yields exactly the same result as the expression - the regular expression to which this string is to be matched if, and only if, this string matches the given regular expression - if the regular expression's syntax is invalid\n• Returns true if and only if this string contains the specified sequence of char values. - the sequence to search for true if this string contains , false otherwise\n• Replaces the first substring of this string that matches the given regular expression with the given replacement. An invocation of this method of the form str regex repl yields exactly the same result as the expression Note that backslashes ( ) and dollar signs ( ) in the replacement string may cause the results to be different than if it were being treated as a literal replacement string; see . Use to suppress the special meaning of these characters, if desired. - the regular expression to which this string is to be matched - the string to be substituted for the first match - if the regular expression's syntax is invalid\n• Replaces each substring of this string that matches the given regular expression with the given replacement.

The replacement proceeds from the beginning of the string to the end, for example, replacing \"aa\" with \"b\" in the string \"aaa\" will result in \"ba\" rather than \"ab\". - The sequence of char values to be replaced\n• Splits this string around matches of the given regular expression The array returned by this method contains each substring of this string that is terminated by another substring that matches the given expression or is terminated by the end of the string. The substrings in the array are in the order in which they occur in this string. If the expression does not match any part of the input then the resulting array has just one element, namely this string. When there is a positive-width match at the beginning of this string then an empty leading substring is included at the beginning of the resulting array. A zero-width match at the beginning however never produces such empty leading substring. The parameter controls the number of times the pattern is applied and therefore affects the length of the resulting array. If the limit n is greater than zero then the pattern will be applied at most n - 1 times, the array's length will be no greater than n, and the array's last entry will contain all input beyond the last matched delimiter. If n is non-positive then the pattern will be applied as many times as possible and the array can have any length. If n is zero then the pattern will be applied as many times as possible, the array can have any length, and trailing empty strings will be discarded. The string , for example, yields the following results with these parameters: An invocation of this method of the form str. regex n yields the same result as the expression - the result threshold, as described above the array of strings computed by splitting this string around matches of the given regular expression - if the regular expression's syntax is invalid\n• Splits this string around matches of the given regular expression This method works as if by invoking the two-argument method with the given expression and a limit argument of zero. Trailing empty strings are therefore not included in the resulting array.

If this object represents an empty character sequence, or the first and last characters of character sequence represented by this object both have codes greater than (the space character), then a reference to this object is returned. Otherwise, if there is no character with a code greater than in the string, then a object representing an empty string is returned. Otherwise, let k be the index of the first character in the string whose code is greater than , and let m be the index of the last character in the string whose code is greater than . A object is returned, representing the substring of this string that begins with the character at index k and ends with the character at index m-that is, the result of .

So for a large number of sub-strings, this can have a performance benefit.

        "document": "Splitting Strings is a very frequent operation; this quick tutorial is focused on some of the API we can use to do this simply in Java.\n\nLet’s start with the core library – the String class itself offers a split() method – which is very convenient and sufficient for most scenarios. It simply splits the given String based on the delimiter, returning an array of Strings.\n\nLet us look at some examples. We’ll start with splitting by a comma:\n\nLet’s now split by multiple characters – a comma, space, and hyphen through regex:\n\nApache’s common lang package provides a StringUtils class – which contains a null-safe split() method, that splits using whitespace as the default delimiter:\n\nFinally, there’s a nice Splitter fluent API in Guava as well:\n\nSometimes a given String contains some leading, trailing, or extra spaces around the delimiter. Let’s see how we can handle splitting the input and trimming the results in one go.\n\nLet’s say we have this as an input:\n\nTo remove extra spaces before and/or after the delimiter, we can perform split and trim using regex:\n\nHere, trim() method removes leading and trailing spaces in the input string, and the regex itself handles the extra spaces around delimiter.\n\nWe can achieve the same result by using Java 8 Stream features:\n\nWe can split a string into two parts by getting its midpoint and using substring() to get the separated parts.\n\nHere’s an example that splits a string in half:\n\nHere, we calculate the midpoint of the string value. Next, we use the substring() method to get the first and second parts of the string value by specifying the ranges.\n\nString.split() is generally enough. However, for more complex cases we can utilize Apache’s commons-lang based StringUtils class, or the clean and flexible Guava APIs."
