        "document": "For a list of known games and their specifics, see Unreal Engine 4-5 games where HDR can be forced.\n\nUnreal Engine 4 has had native HDR output support since version 4.14 and it can be forced in many games that don't officially support it with mixed results. \n\nEarlier versions of the engine required running in Exclusive Fullscreen (FSE) in order for this to work, while newer versions supports it for windowed modes as well, though some more recent versions have broken HDR in DirectX 12 out of the box,[citation needed] requiring the use of launch argument to run games in DirectX 11[Note 1].\n\nDepending on the version of the engine or the way it renders UI, the UI might use the wrong gamma and look washed out. Additionally, some color correction features of the SDR tonemapper are skipped in HDR, like parts of the filmic grading (which isn't necessary, nor generally wanted in HDR) and color correction LUTs.\n\nSome games don't acknowledge user config changes, for these it's sometimes possible to force HDR by runtime memory editing.\n\nForce the built-in HDR display output of the engine:\n• Refer to the list of Unreal Engine 4-5 games where HDR can be forced for details about whether the built-in HDR display output is known to work with the game. Using the guide below, modify or to include the following lines or enforce the variables via UE4SS:\n• If the display supports 2000 nits or higher, change to to use the 2000 nits output mode.\n• Add these lines to boost the make the UI blend in closely as how it did in SDR, and boost its brightness (this also allows HDR to work properly in DX12 in some UE4 versions, otherwise the UI would draw with the wrong gamma) (note that depending on the UE4 version, the UI will be broken regardless of the settings in HDR):\n• If DirectX 11 must be forced for HDR output to work, launch the game using the command line argument.[Note 1]\n• The game should now launch with HDR display output enabled and working.\n• If DirectX 12 is the preferred or only way to play, and colors look off with it, start the game and try to bring out the developers console (e.g. with Universal Unreal Engine 4 Unlocker).\n\nAfter that, write (or for 2000+ nits) on it. This is because in UE4 DirectX 11 only supports scRGB HDR swapchains, while DirectX 12 only supports HDR10 swapchains, but UE4 wrongfully selected scRGB HDR mode for DX12 as well. See the official engine documentation for more details.\n\nEntire game besides the HUD and menu elements are white on Linux\n\nNative resolution is not available in borderless window modes\n\nSteamVR starts despite the game not using HMD devices\n\nGameThread timed out waiting for RenderThread - After Windows Standby\n\nwill usually accept cvar name/value pairs inside it, but only if entered into a section.\n• Open the file inside the games config folder in a text editor.\n• If the file does not have a section, add one to the bottom.\n• Inside that section, add any preferred cvar name/value pairs, with the name/value separated with an '=' character, eg: . Comments can also be added to the file by starting them with a ';' character. Values set with this method should usually override any value set elsewhere, however, some games might store values inside savegames or set them per-scene, which may override them when the save gets loaded or a scene gets switched - the only workaround for these kind of games is to set the value through the developer console after loading the save and expect that the modified value may be written into the save. The game may rewrite this file when exiting, usually removing any empty lines and lines containing only comments - any custom cvars should still be saved, though the file can be set as \"read-only\" if this rewrite isn't desired. Changes to the games config files should be made while it is not running. As previously mentioned, the game may overwrite the file when exiting. Unreal Engine 4 uses a hierarchical configuration scheme (on top of the multiple configuration categories previously mentioned), meaning that there can be multiple versions of (e.g.) found in different places, some of which may be prefixed with 'Default', 'Base', or 'Windows'. In general, it is best to edit the config file in the user configuration directory, as this should take priority over all others and work even if the game ships with encrypted config files. The file is usually located in .\n\nSee the list of games that use Unreal Engine 4."

        "document": "Update: There's more than one UE4 guide now. Please check out this guide too. I've reach out to the poster to transfer some knowledge over and make it easier to have one large post for players to find.\n\nSo originally I compiled some UE4 tweaks for ToF back then here.\n\nAs always, please exercise caution when modifying configs as it may not be officially supported by the developers. We do not know Kuro's full stance on relatively harmless graphic tweaks that help players enjoy the game better.\n\nNow I wanted to make some for this game. I will need feedback different systems and whether or not these work. Since my PC is quite beefy, this game already runs smooth for me at 60fps (waiting on 120fps). The game is fairly optimized already for a gacha game running on UE4, but there's always room for improvement with user tweaks.\n\nSo to get started, all these configs are for Engine.ini.\n\nHere's a before and after image of my maxed settings vs WW's default max settings:\n\nhttps://imgsli.com/MjY2ODcx\n\nThis can be found in WW's game installation folder under: {your install}\\Wuthering Waves Game\\Client\\Saved\\Config\\WindowsNoEditor\\Engine.ini.\n\nEdit with your favorite text editing tool while the game is closed. Please make a backup copy of your original incase there's any issues.\n\nAt the bottom of the Engine.ini file, append . All these configs will be going under [SystemSettings] so it's important that you append that at the bottom of the file first.\n\nThese tweaks generally help most UE4 games with stutter. If you're having issues, try these first. Please note that these do not increase your FPS. You need to adjust the graphics accordingly in the game first to reach your desired performance level before using these tweaks.\n\nThese are general graphic tweaks for increasing distance scaling, shadows, bloom, and other various tweaks. You may not want to use these because they are heavier than the max settings in the game.\n\nThese are AA improvements if no DLSS is enabled.\n\nThese are DLSS tweaks to improve the image quality.\n\nIf there's any questions or feedback, feel free to let me know here! I'll try to make updates as soon as possible."

        "document": "So, what is Engine.ini?\n\nwithout it, nothing will happen\n\nThis is a nice and simple draw distance multiplier which applies to static scenery-most notably, the railroad tracks and ties. The default value is 1, so whatever number you insert in place of \"value\" is the multiplier for how far away things will be drawn. This is the most resource intensive command of them all, as the extra objects rendered will massively increase RAM usage and slightly increase GPU usage. A modest example is r.ViewDistanceScale=5, which renders scenery at 5 times the distance.\n\nTSW lacks an option for gamma. r.Color.Mid is as close as you'll get to that. At a default of 0.5 (AKA 50%) as the middle, sometimes the game looks too bright. While less of an issue thanks to the Sand Patch lighting update, a slight decrease in brightness can help things look a bit more natural. r.Color.Mid=0.4 works nice\n\nA confusing and controversial option. While defaulted to 1 (or \"high\" quality) changing it to 0 (or \"low\" quality) actually increases the draw distance of procedural foliage. 0 should definitely have worse draw distance, so I guess someone at DTG screwed something up. Note that grass is the only thing like this, and changing it to 0 will reduce the quality of other objects . I really wish DTG would fix the grass but they don't seem interested in that. r.MaterialQualityLevel=0\n\nThe original Engine.ini tweak-usually used to turn off motion blur, that's about all it's useful for. It can handle other values from 0 to 4, but if you want to turn off motion blur and keep it off without needing to hit Ctrl + F2, just set this to 0. It has no FPS impact, and will probably increase FPS if anything. r.MotionBlurQuality=0\n\nThis (and other assorted LOD Bias settings) can be used to make things look good from far away, especially when r.ViewDistanceScale does not apply. Trains are skeletal meshes, so this setting makes trains look better...or worse. In the case of an LOD bias, a negative number makes things look better, a positive number makes them look worse. UE4 isn't perfect at handling skeletal meshes, and this one can really hurt FPS, so use it at your own risk. A more reasonable value to set is r.SkeletalMeshLODBias=-2\n\nMip mapping makes textures blurrier when they get further away, kinda like how 3D models get less detailed as they get further away. Though unlike 3D models, this blur actually prevents things from looking horrible. Still, a slight reduction in blurring power can help. Negative numbers reduce the blur, positive numbers increase the blur. Just a slight change to r.MipMapLodBias=-1 can make things look a little crisper without turning up the screen percentage.\n\nThis LOD setting applies to stuff like trees and bushes. One common complaint is that the transition between tree LODs is too noticeable. Set this value to something greater than 1, and trees will render at higher quality further away. Not only will that look better, but it will also make the transition between LODs happen further away, which looks a lot better than it changing up front. Before you go too crazy, remember that this is a multiplier, setting it to 20 will render trees 20 times further away...which is a lot. If you want to be reasonable, use foliage.LODDistanceScale=3\n\nDon't like fog? Think a clear day shouldn't be quite this foggy? Well, you can add r.Fog=0 to Engine.ini in order to remove all fog...in all weather presets. The main problem with this option is that even weather presets that should have fog will not have fog, so you'll need to turn it off and on to use it correctly. It's rarely worth the effort. And again, as a binary option defaulted to 1, there is no reason to enter this in Engine.ini except to set it to 0."
