        "document": "In C, a variable defined in a function is stored in the stack memory. The requirement of this memory is that it needs to know the size of the data to memory at compile time (before the program runs). Also, once defined, we can neither change the size nor completely delete the memory.\n\nTo resolve this, C provides a feature called Dynamic Memory Allocation. It allows you to allocate memory at runtime, giving your program the ability to handle data of varying sizes. Dynamic resources are stored in the heap memory instead of the stack.\n\nThis feature is useful in a variety of situations. For example, changing the size of an array according to our requirement.\n\nAs we know, the size of an array in C is fixed and should be known at compile time. There can be two problems:\n\nThe size of the array is not sufficient to store all the elements. To resolve this, one might set the size to store the maximum theoretically possible elements. This creates another problem.\n\nThis size of the array is much more than what is required to store the elements. This leads to the wastage of memory.\n\nThis is where the dynamic memory allocation comes in. The size of the array can be increased if more elements are to be inserted and decreased of less elements are inserted. Moreover, there is no need to estimate the max possible size. The size can be decided at runtime according to the requirement.\n\nDynamic memory allocation is possible in C by using 4 library functions provided by <stdlib.h> library:\n\nLet’s discuss each of them one by one.\n\nThe malloc() (stands for memory allocation) function is used to allocate a single block of contiguous memory on the heap at runtime. The memory allocated by malloc() is uninitialized, meaning it contains garbage values.\n\nwhere size is the number of bytes to allocate.\n\nThis function returns a void pointer to the allocated memory that needs to be converted to the pointer of required type to be usable. If allocation fails, it returns NULL pointer.\n\nAssume that we want to create an array to store 5 integers. Since the size of int is 4 bytes, we need 5 * 4 bytes = 20 bytes of memory. This can be done as shown:\n\nIn the above malloc call, we hardcoded the number of bytes we need to store 5 integers. But we know that the size of the integer in C depends on the architecture. So, it is better to use the sizeof operator to find the size of type you want to store.\n\nMoreover, if there is no memory available, the malloc will fail and return NULL. So, it is recommended to check for failure by comparing the ptr to NULL.\n\nThe calloc() (stands for contiguous allocation) function is similar to malloc(), but it initializes the allocated memory to zero. It is used when you need memory with default zero values.\n\nwhere n is the number of elements and size is the size of each element in bytes.\n\nThis function also returns a void pointer to the allocated memory that is converted to the pointer of required type to be usable. If allocation fails, it returns NULL pointer.\n\nWe can take the example of malloc() and try to do it with calloc() function.\n\nThe memory allocated using functions malloc() and calloc() is not de-allocated on their own. The free() function is used to release dynamically allocated memory back to the operating system. It is essential to free memory that is no longer needed to avoid memory leaks.\n\nwhere ptr is the pointer to the allocated memory.\n\nAfter freeing a memory block, the pointer becomes invalid, and it is no longer pointing to a valid memory location.\n\nAfter calling free(), it is a good practice to set the pointer to NULL to avoid using a “dangling pointer,” which points to a memory location that has been deallocated.\n\nrealloc() function is used to resize a previously allocated memory block. It allows you to change the size of an existing memory allocation without needing to free the old memory and allocate a new block.\n\nwhere, ptr is the pointer to the previously allocated memory block and new_size is the reallocated size that the memory block should have in bytes.\n\nThis function returns a pointer to the newly allocated memory, or NULL if the reallocation fails. If it fails, the original memory block remains unchanged.\n\nSuppose we initially allocate memory for 5 integers but later need to expand the array to hold 10 integers. We can use realloc() to resize the memory block:\n\nIt is important to note that if realloc() fails and returns NULL, the original memory block is not freed, so you should not overwrite the original pointer until you’ve successfully allocated a new block. To prevent memory leaks, it’s a good practice to handle the NULL return value carefully:\n\nConsider the first scenario where we were having issues with the fixes size array. Let’s see how we can resolve both of these issues using dynamic memory allocation.\n\nIn this program, we are managing the memory allocated to the pointer ptr according to our needs by changing the size using realloc(). It can be a fun exercise to implement an array which grows according to the elements inserted in it. This kind of arrays are called dynamically growing arrays.\n\nAs useful as dynamic memory allocation is, it is also prone to errors that requires careful handling to avoid the high memory usage or even system crashes. Few of the common errors are given below:\n• Dangling Pointers : Using a pointer after freeing its memory can cause undefined behavior or crashes.\n• Fragmentation : Repeated allocations and deallocations can fragment memory, causing inefficient use of heap space.\n• Allocation Failures : If memory allocation fails, the program may crash unless the error is handled properly.\n\nThe functions malloc() and calloc() works very similar to one another. So, why there was the need for two such similar functions.\n\nIt turns out that even though they are similar, they have different use cases due to the minor difference between them regarding the memory initialization. malloc() does not initialize memory while calloc() initializes the memory with zero.\n\nCan we only create arrays dynamically?\n\nWhat happens if memory allocation fails?\n\nWhat happens when you don’t free memory after allocating?\n\nWhat is the limit of memory that we can allocate using these functions?\n\nCan we set the new size of allocated memory to 0 with realloc()?"

Here are some best practices for creating dynamic arrays in C:\n• Initialize the pointer: When creating a pointer for a dynamic array, it is a good practice to initialize it to NULL. This ensures that the pointer does not point to any random memory location.\n• Use malloc/calloc to allocate memory: To allocate memory for a dynamic array, use the malloc or calloc function. Malloc allocates a block of memory of the specified size, while calloc allocates memory and initializes it to 0.\n• Check for errors: Always check the return value of the memory allocation function to ensure that the allocation was successful. If the function returns NULL, then the allocation failed, and you should handle the error appropriately.\n• Use sizeof to calculate the size: When allocating memory for a dynamic array, use the sizeof operator with a variable to calculate the size of each element. This ensures that you allocate enough memory for the array.\n• Use realloc to resize the array: If you need to resize the dynamic array, use the realloc function. This function can resize the array and preserve its existing data.\n• Free memory when done: Always remember to free the memory allocated for the dynamic array when you’re done using it. This helps prevent memory leaks and improves the overall performance of your program.\n• Avoid casting the result of malloc or calloc: It can hide an error if you forgot to include . This can cause crashes (or, worse, not cause a crash until way later in some totally different part of the code).\n\nHere’s an example of creating a dynamic array of integers using malloc:\n\nAnd here’s an example of resizing the dynamic array using realloc:"

        "document": "I know this is an old post but there hasn't really been much of a comprehensive answer to best practice in terms of style, which I think is what the op really wanted, so here is my take on memory allocation in C. Note I am more of a C++ person so much of my thoughts come from that attitude.\n\nIt is often handy to know whether your pointer is allocated, so always assign NULL to a pointer when you declare it. You can also create yourself a safe free function which frees the memory and then assigns NULL to it so you don't have to worry.\n\nIf you allocate memory in one C file then you should free it in the same file. This is perhaps more restrictive than needed, however if you are writing a library then you should definitely free any memory within your library that is malloc'd in your library. This is because on Windows dlls have a different heap to the exe, so mallocing memory in a dll and freeing it in the exe corrupts your heap.\n\nBy extension and for the sake of symmetry this means if you have a function which returns a pointer to allocated memory then you should have a function which frees that memory. This is why many librarys have an initialisation function which returns a pointer to some data (generally cast as a void *) then a cleanup function which will free the library's resources. If you can malloc and free within the same function then that is good as it makes it easy for you to keep track of things.\n\nDo not try to allocate all your memory at the beginning of a function and then free it at the end. This just means that if you want to return part way through the function you have to free all the memory, whereas if you malloc and free memory as you go you will have fewer pointers to free.\n\nIf you often have functions which allocate many pointers, then consider creating and array which holds pointers to all your pointers at the beginning of the function, then have a function that frees them all. This will save you the inevitable \"I'll come back and sort my memory leaks later\" syndrome if you want to return mid function.\n\nThe concept of factories is useful. A factory would be a function which mallocs the memory for a struct, assigns function pointer to the struct, initialises its variables and then returns the pointer to it. If the first of those was a destructor or an array of specific functions then you can have a generic destroy function that can call any struct's destructor, then free the struct's memory. You can also hide some of the internal details of the class by having different inward and outward facing definition of the struct. COM is built upon these principles.\n\nSo these are just the ways I look at memory in C. It isn't as elegant as in C++, but as you are relying on humans to deal with it, there are strategies like those above that can make things as simple as possible for them.\n\nNote also that there are always exceptions to every rule - these are just things that I think about when I use C. I'm sure other people have other ideas."

Optimal Substructure:The minimum cost to reach any cell in the grid can be derived from smaller subproblems (i.e., the cost to reach neighboring cells). Specifically, the recursive relation will look like: If the last element (i.e., cell (m, n)) is reached, the cost to reach it will be the value of the cell plus the minimum cost to reach one of its valid neighboring cells (left, up, or diagonal). In the recursive approach, subproblems are computed multiple times. For example, when computing the minimum cost from (m, n), we may need to compute the cost for (m-1, n) multiple times. This repetition can be avoided by storing the results of subproblems in a memoization table.\n• 2D memo tabl (m x n) to store the computed values, initialized to -1 to indicate uncomputed subproblems.\n• None If we are at the starting cell (0, 0), return the value of cost[0][0].\n• None Before computing the result for any cell (m, n), check if the value at memo[m][n] is already computed. If it is, return the stored\n• None If the value is not computed, recursively minimum cost and store it in memo[m][n].\n• None Finally, return the value in memo[m][n] for the minimum cost to reach the target cell (m-1, n-1).\n\n// C++ implementation to find the minimum cost path // Function to return the cost of the minimum cost path // If indices are out of bounds, return a large value // Return precomputed value if available // Function to return the cost of the minimum cost path // If indices are out of bounds, return a large value // Return precomputed value if available # If indices are out of bounds, # Return precomputed value if available // C# implementation to find the minimum cost path // Function to return the cost of the minimum cost path // If indices are out of bounds, return a large value // Return precomputed value if available // If indices are out of bounds, return a large value // Return precomputed value if available\n\nThe approach here is similar to the recursive one but instead of breaking down the problem recursively, we iteratively build up the solution by calculating it in a bottom-up manner.
