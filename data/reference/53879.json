You concatenate strings by using the operator. For string literals and string constants, concatenation occurs at compile time; no run-time concatenation occurs. For string variables, concatenation occurs only at run time.\n\nThe following example splits a long string literal into smaller strings to improve readability in the source code. The code concatenates the smaller strings to create the long string literal. The parts are concatenated into a single string at compile time. There's no run-time performance cost regardless of the number of strings involved.\n\nTo concatenate string variables, you can use the or operators, string interpolation or the String.Format, String.Concat, String.Join or StringBuilder.Append methods. The operator is easy to use and makes for intuitive code. Even if you use several operators in one statement, the string content is copied only once. The following code shows examples of using the and operators to concatenate strings:\n\nIn some expressions, it's easier to concatenate strings using string interpolation, as the following code shows:\n\nYou can use string interpolation to initialize a constant string when all the expressions used for placeholders are also constant strings.\n\nAnother method to concatenate strings is String.Format. This method works well when you're building a string from a few component strings.\n\nIn other cases, you might be combining strings in a loop where the actual number of source strings can be large. The StringBuilder class was designed for these scenarios. The following code uses the Append method of the StringBuilder class to concatenate strings.\n\nYou can read more about the reasons to choose string concatenation or the class.\n\nAnother option to join strings from a collection is to use String.Concat method. Use String.Join method if a delimiter should separate source strings. The following code combines an array of words using both methods:\n\nAt last, you can use LINQ and the Enumerable.Aggregate method to join strings from a collection. This method combines the source strings using a lambda expression. The lambda expression does the work to add each string to the existing accumulation. The following example combines an array of words, adding a space between each word in the array:\n\nThis option can cause more allocations than other methods for concatenating collections, as it creates an intermediate string for each iteration.

        "document": "A string is an object of type String whose value is text. Internally, the text is stored as a sequential read-only collection of Char objects. The Length property of a string represents the number of objects it contains, not the number of Unicode characters. To access the individual Unicode code points in a string, use the StringInfo object.\n\nIn C#, the keyword is an alias for String; therefore, and are equivalent. Use the provided alias as it works even without . The class provides many methods for safely creating, manipulating, and comparing strings. In addition, the C# language overloads some operators to simplify common string operations. For more information about the keyword, see string. For more information about the type and its methods, see String.\n\nYou can declare and initialize strings in various ways, as shown in the following example:\n\nYou don't use the new operator to create a string object except when initializing the string with an array of chars.\n\nInitialize a string with the Empty constant value to create a new String object whose string is of zero length. The string literal representation of a zero-length string is . By initializing strings with the Empty value instead of null, you can reduce the chances of a NullReferenceException occurring. Use the static IsNullOrEmpty(String) method to verify the value of a string before you try to access it.\n\nString objects are immutable: they can't be changed after they're created. All of the String methods and C# operators that appear to modify a string actually return the results in a new string object. In the following example, when the contents of and are concatenated to form a single string, the two original strings are unmodified. The operator creates a new string that contains the combined contents. That new object is assigned to the variable , and the original object that was assigned to is released for garbage collection because no other variable holds a reference to it.\n\nBecause a string \"modification\" is actually a new string creation, you must use caution when you create references to strings. If you create a reference to a string, and then \"modify\" the original string, the reference continues to point to the original object instead of the new object that was created when the string was modified. The following code illustrates this behavior:\n\nFor more information about how to create new strings that are based on modifications such as search and replace operations on the original string, see How to modify string contents.\n\nQuoted string literals start and end with a single double quote character ( ) on the same line. Quoted string literals are best suited for strings that fit on a single line and don't include any escape sequences. A quoted string literal must embed escape characters, as shown in the following example:\n\nVerbatim string literals are more convenient for multi-line strings, strings that contain backslash characters, or embedded double quotes. Verbatim strings preserve new line characters as part of the string text. Use double quotation marks to embed a quotation mark inside a verbatim string. The following example shows some common uses for verbatim strings:\n\nBeginning with C# 11, you can use raw string literals to more easily create strings that are multi-line, or use any characters requiring escape sequences. Raw string literals remove the need to ever use escape sequences. You can write the string, including whitespace formatting, how you want it to appear in output. A raw string literal:\n• Starts and ends with a sequence of at least three double quote characters ( ). You can use more than three consecutive characters to start and end the sequence to support string literals that contain three (or more) repeated quote characters.\n• Single line raw string literals require the opening and closing quote characters on the same line.\n• Multi-line raw string literals require both opening and closing quote characters on their own line.\n• In multi-line raw string literals, any whitespace to the left of the closing quotes is removed from all lines of the raw string literal.\n• In multi-line raw string literals, whitespace following the opening quote on the same line is ignored.\n• In multi-line raw string literals, whitespace only lines following the opening quote are included in the string literal.\n\nThe following examples demonstrate these rules:\n\nThe following examples demonstrate the compiler errors reported based on these rules:\n\nThe first two examples are invalid because multiline raw string literals require the opening and closing quote sequence on its own line. The third example is invalid because the text is outdented from the closing quote sequence.\n\nYou should consider raw string literals when you're generating text that includes characters that require escape sequences when using quoted string literals or verbatim string literals. Raw string literals are easier for you and others to read because it more closely resembles the output text. For example, consider the following code that includes a string of formatted JSON:\n\nA format string is a string whose contents are determined dynamically at run time. Format strings are created by embedding interpolated expressions or placeholders inside of braces within a string. Everything inside the braces ( ) is resolved to a value and output as a formatted string at run time. There are two methods to create format strings: string interpolation and composite formatting.\n\nYou declare Interpolated strings with the special character. An interpolated string includes interpolated expressions in braces. If you're new to string interpolation, see the String interpolation - C# interactive tutorial for a quick overview.\n\nUse string interpolation to improve the readability and maintainability of your code. String interpolation achieves the same results as the method, but improves ease of use and inline clarity.\n\nYou can use string interpolation to initialize a constant string when all the expressions used for placeholders are also constant strings.\n\nBeginning with C# 11, you can combine raw string literals with string interpolations. You start and end the format string with three or more successive double quotes. If your output string should contain the or character, you can use extra characters to specify how many and characters start and end an interpolation. Any sequence of fewer or characters is included in the output. The following example shows how you can use that feature to display the distance of a point from the origin, and place the point inside braces:\n\nC# also allows verbatim string interpolation, for example across multiple lines, using the or syntax.\n\nTo interpret escape sequences literally, use a verbatim string literal. An interpolated verbatim string starts with the character followed by the character. You can use the and tokens in any order: both and are valid interpolated verbatim strings.\n\nThe String.Format utilizes placeholders in braces to create a format string. This example results in similar output to the string interpolation method used in the preceding sample.\n\nFor more information on formatting .NET types, see Formatting Types in .NET.\n\nA substring is any sequence of characters that is contained in a string. Use the Substring method to create a new string from a part of the original string. You can search for one or more occurrences of a substring by using the IndexOf method. Use the Replace method to replace all occurrences of a specified substring with a new string. Like the Substring method, Replace actually returns a new string and doesn't modify the original string. For more information, see How to search strings and How to modify string contents.\n\nYou can use array notation with an index value to acquire read-only access to individual characters, as in the following example:\n\nIf the String methods don't provide the functionality that you must have to modify individual characters in a string, you can use a StringBuilder object to modify the individual chars \"in-place,\" and then create a new string to store the results by using the StringBuilder methods. In the following example, assume that you must modify the original string in a particular way and then store the results for future use:\n\nAn empty string is an instance of a System.String object that contains zero characters. Empty strings are used often in various programming scenarios to represent a blank text field. You can call methods on empty strings because they're valid System.String objects. Empty strings are initialized as follows:\n\nBy contrast, a null string doesn't refer to an instance of a System.String object and any attempt to call a method on a null string causes a NullReferenceException. However, you can use null strings in concatenation and comparison operations with other strings. The following examples illustrate some cases in which a reference to a null string does and doesn't cause an exception to be thrown:\n\nString operations in .NET are highly optimized and in most cases don't significantly impact performance. However, in some scenarios such as tight loops that are executing many hundreds or thousands of times, string operations can affect performance. The StringBuilder class creates a string buffer that offers better performance if your program performs many string manipulations. The StringBuilder string also enables you to reassign individual characters, something the built-in string data type doesn't support. This code, for example, changes the content of a string without creating a new string:\n\nIn this example, a StringBuilder object is used to create a string from a set of numeric types:\n\nBecause the String type implements IEnumerable<T>, you can use the extension methods defined in the Enumerable class on strings. To avoid visual clutter, these methods are excluded from IntelliSense for the String type, but they're available nevertheless. You can also use LINQ query expressions on strings.

Alright, moving on from chocolates, programming is a lot like that. Particularly in C#, it’s about assembling smaller pieces to create something bigger and functional. Today, we’re going to focus on one specific process – string concatenation. Interesting, eh?\n\nLet’s kick- things-off by diving straight into the core concept. String concatenation is essentially the process of joining two or more strings together.\n\nThe Basics of C# String Concat\n\nIn C#, “String Concat” is almost like a superglue for your text. Want to join “Hello” and “World!” together? String concat has got you covered. Let’s look at a simple example:\n\nIn the above snippet, we’ve utilized the method to join “Hello” and “World!” together. The result? HelloWorld! Smooth, isn’t it?\n\nC# String Variable: What is it?\n\nStill with me? Okay, then let’s explore something even more fundamental – C# String variables. A string in C# is an object of the String class. This ‘String’ class provides us with methods and properties to manipulate text by creating instances of the String class, popularly known as string variables, we can store text and manipulate it as desired.\n\nIn the above code, ‘greet’ is a string variable holding the text “Hello World!”. So, when we write this string variable on the console, it outputs – you guessed it – “Hello World!”.\n\nA Complete Guide on How to Concatenate Strings in C#\n\nCould there be more ways to concatenate strings? Oh, totally. C# is conveniently packed with abundant methods for string concatenation. Let’s delve into some of these techniques.\n\nHow to use C# Append to String\n\nLet’s say you have a string, and you want to add some text at the end. That’s where the function steps in.\n\nIn this example, we use the class to append strings to an existing string. The method is pretty versatile – it ensures efficient memory usage and faster performance when dealing with large string operations.\n\nThe method is a favourite, and for decent reasons. It enables us to join strings, with the freedom to specify a delimiter (separator) that separates the strings. Yes, the power of choice is fantastic, isn’t it?\n\nVoila! With the above example, we’re joining words from the ‘words’ array using the method and separating them by a space. After all, “HelloWorld!” does look a bit cramped, doesn’t it?\n\nhas a lot more tricks up its sleeves. Let’s venture deeper into understanding its prowess and handiness.\n\nAn Exploratory Approach to String.Join in C#\n\nWhat if you’re dealing with a list of string objects – would still work? Absolutely. With , lists are as good as arrays!\n\nThe above code joins a list of strings and separates them by a comma. Thus, versatility is the name of the game with .\n\nString Add C#: How It Works?\n\nNow you’ve heard of , , and . But how about an even simpler method for concatenation? The ‘+’ operator, that’s right. Interestingly, it works equally well for adding numbers and concatenating strings.\n\nIn the code above, we’re using the ‘+’ operator to piece together three separate strings – “Hello”, a blank space, and “World!”.\n\nSo, we’ve covered the method. But wouldn’t it be exhilarating to plunge deeper into , wouldn’t it? You bet.\n\nIn C#, does not create a new string object. Instead, it modifies the existing StringBuilder instance by appending the specified string at the end of the current instance. Yes, it keeps it short and simple.\n\nThe method in StringBuilder class is quicker and more memory-efficient for larger amounts of string data. It’s like a film editor who efficiently edits movies without requiring another reel.\n\nBut what if you want to append different types of data? Not a problem at all. method accommodates all data types – be it a number, a Boolean or a char.\n\nIn the provided example, number ‘6’ and Boolean ‘True’ have been seamlessly appended with other strings.\n\nBest way to Concatenate Strings in C#\n\nNow, let’s grab the bull by the horns – what’s the optimal way to concatenate strings? That’s the million-dollar question. So, let’s unravel it.\n\nIn the C# World, we have multiple ways to concatenate strings. But they fall into two main categories: compile-time concatenation methods such as and operators, and runtime concatenation methods like , , and . The important part here is determining when and how to use them efficiently.\n• operators: Suitable for simple, small scale operations. But for larger operations, they can be quite inefficient and resource-taxing.\n• : Works well with relatively small or medium-sized strings. Again, it can be inefficient for larger operations.\n• : The most efficient when dealing with lengthy strings or repeated concatenations in loops.\n• : The best option for concatenating string arrays or lists with a common delimiter.\n\nRemember, the trick here is to pick the right tool for the right job!\n\nC# Prepend: Adding Value Before a String\n\nRemember when I said concatenation is similar to lining up chocolates? Well, sometimes, you might want a particular chocolate (let’s say, the one with almonds) to be at the beginning of your super-chocolate line. Similarly, in C#, we use a process known as ‘Prepend’ to add a value or string before another string.\n\nUnderstanding the Mechanism of C# Prepend\n\nIt’s pretty straightforward and similar to Append. The only difference is – instead of adding to the end of an existing string, prepend adds to the beginning.\n\nThe code above demonstrates the method of , which successfully prepends “Hello ” before “World!”. You just gotta love the attention to detail here.\n\nC’mon, we both know that Strings are not just about concatenating or appending. It’s about managing, changing, and manipulating string content in several stimulating ways, just like how you’d manage your wardrobe to suit your style!\n\nHow to Manipulate C# String Content\n\nC# offers several techniques to manipulate strings, such as trimming, padding, replacing, splitting, and so much more. Each technique serves a particular purpose and contributes to intensifying the dynamism of the language.\n• Trimming: Remove spaces or specific characters from the start or end of a string.\n• Padding: Add additional characters to the start or end of a string.\n• Conversion: Convert a string’s case or convert a string to other data types.\n• Searching: Search for a specific character, substring, or pattern in a string.\n• Comparison: Compare two strings for equality or order.\n\nLike wondering which shirt goes well with your pants, knowing which technique to use takes a bit of practice – but trust me, it’s more fun than it sounds!\n\nWe’re near the end, folks. We have unpacked a ton from the magical world of C# string concatenation. Let’s take a step back and discuss the real-world applications of these techniques and potential challenges you might encounter.\n\nFrom developing complex software systems to creating basic console applications, string manipulation and concatenation play a significant role in various real-world applications. Here are a few examples:\n• Mobile Apps: User input validation, strong format for display, and creating dynamic messages for user interaction.\n• Game Development: Used to generate dynamic dialogue, create game status messages, or handle player’s input.\n• Data Processing: Clean and format data for processing, parse text files, or extract useful information from raw data.\n\nDespite C#’s impressive capabilities, you may encounter a few challenges where the language’s performance, efficiency, or style doesn’t meet your expectations. Just like your favorite superhero, these challenges make your coding journey more exciting.\n• Performance: When dealing with large volume or complex string operations, performance can decrease significantly.\n• Memory Usage: Extensive usage of certain string concatenation techniques can lead to increased memory usage.\n\nRemember, every challenge has a solution. For performance and memory usage, can be your best friend. And for readability? Simple – use clearly named variables and breaking down complex operations into smaller, more manageable parts.\n\nPhew, that was a lot, wasn’t it? But remember, mastery comes with practice – so get on with your C# journey! String concatenation in C# isn’t tricky. However, it’s all about picking the right technique for the task at hand, which brings us to the million-dollar question – wait for it – What’s your favorite chocol- err – string concatenation technique, and why? Discover your style and start creating your own super-chocolate! Or super string, if you will.\n\nAnd what happens if you don’t start practicing these techniques? Well, you might be left behind in this fast-paced world of coding. So, what’s stopping you now? Roll up your sleeves and start creating magic with C#."
