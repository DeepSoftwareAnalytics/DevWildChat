        "document": "A simple, but extensible Python implementation for the Telegram Bot API.\n• General API Documentation\n• General use of the API\n• Advanced use of the API\n• Controlling the amount of Threads used by TeleBot\n• F.A.Q.\n• How can I distinguish a User and a GroupChat in message.chat?\n\nThis API is tested with Python 3.9-3.13 and Pypy 3. There are two ways to install the library:\n\nIt is generally recommended to use the first option.\n\nWhile the API is production-ready, it is still under development and it has regular updates, do not forget to update it regularly by calling\n\nIt is presumed that you have obtained an API token with @BotFather. We will call this token . Furthermore, you have basic knowledge of the Python programming language and more importantly the Telegram Bot API.\n\nThe TeleBot class (defined in _init_.py) encapsulates all API calls in a single class. It provides functions such as ( , etc.) and several ways to listen for incoming messages.\n\nCreate a file called . Then, open the file and create an instance of the TeleBot class.\n\nNote: Make sure to actually replace TOKEN with your own API token.\n\nAfter that declaration, we need to register some so-called message handlers. Message handlers define filters which a message must pass. If a message passes the filter, the decorated function is called and the incoming message is passed as an argument.\n\nA function which is decorated by a message handler can have an arbitrary name, however, it must have only one parameter (the message).\n\nThis one echoes all incoming text messages back to the sender. It uses a lambda function to test a message. If the lambda returns True, the message is handled by the decorated function. Since we want all messages to be handled by this function, we simply always return True.\n\nNote: all handlers are tested in the order in which they were declared\n\nWe now have a basic bot which replies a static message to \"/start\" and \"/help\" commands and which echoes the rest of the sent messages. To start the bot, add the following to our source file:\n\nAlright, that's it! Our source file now looks like this:\n\nTo start the bot, simply open up a terminal and enter to run the bot! Test it by sending commands ('/start' and '/help') and arbitrary text messages.\n\nAll types are defined in types.py. They are all completely in line with the Telegram API's definition of the types, except for the Message's field, which is renamed to (because is a Python reserved token). Thus, attributes such as can be accessed directly with . Note that can be either an instance of or (see How can I distinguish a User and a GroupChat in message.chat?).\n\nThe Message object also has a attribute, which defines the type of the Message. can be one of the following strings: , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , .\n\nYou can use some types in one function. Example:\n\nAll API methods are located in the TeleBot class. They are renamed to follow common Python naming conventions. E.g. is renamed to and to .\n\nOutlined below are some general use cases of the API.\n\nA message handler is a function that is decorated with the decorator of a TeleBot instance. Message handlers consist of one or multiple filters. Each filter must return True for a certain message in order for a message handler to become eligible to handle that message. A message handler is declared in the following way (provided is an instance of TeleBot):\n\nis not bound to any restrictions. Any function name is permitted with message handlers. The function must accept at most one argument, which will be the message that the function must handle. is a list of keyword arguments. A filter is declared in the following manner: . One handler may have multiple filters. TeleBot supports the following filters:\n\nHere are some examples of using the filters and message handlers:\n\nImportant: all handlers are tested in the order in which they were declared\n\nHandle updates of a the bot's member status in a chat\n\nHandle updates of a chat member's status in a chat Note: \"chat_member\" updates are not requested by default. If you want to allow all update types, set in / to\n\nNow, you can use inline_handler to get inline queries in telebot.\n\nUse chosen_inline_handler to get chosen_inline_result in telebot. Don't forget to add the /setinlinefeedback command for @Botfather.\n\nA middleware handler is a function that allows you to modify requests or the bot context as they pass through the Telegram to the bot. You can imagine middleware as a chain of logic connection handled before any other handlers are executed. Middleware processing is disabled by default, enable it by setting .\n\nThere are other examples using middleware handler in the examples/middleware directory.\n\nThere are class-based middlewares. Basic class-based middleware looks like this:\n\nClass-based middleware should have two functions: post and pre process. So, as you can see, class-based middlewares work before and after handler execution. For more, check out in examples\n\nAlso, you can use built-in custom filters. Or, you can create your own filter.\n\nAlso, we have examples on them. Check this links:\n\nYou can check some built-in filters in source code\n\nExample of filtering by id\n\nExample of filtering by text\n\nIf you want to add some built-in filter, you are welcome to add it in custom_filters.py file.\n\nHere is example of creating filter-class:\n\nAll functions of TeleBot take an optional argument. This argument must be an instance of , or , which are defined in types.py.\n\nThe last example yields this result:\n\nThis object represents one special entity in a text message. For example, hashtags, usernames, URLs, etc. Attributes:\n\nHere's an Example: \n\n Here is the entity number or order of entity in a reply, for if incase there are multiple entities in the reply/message.\n\n returns a list of entities object. \n\n would give the type of the first entity\n\n Refer Bot Api for extra details\n\nSince version 5.0 of the Bot API, you have the possibility to run your own Local Bot API Server. pyTelegramBotAPI also supports this feature.\n\nImportant: Like described here, you have to log out your bot from the Telegram server before switching to your local API server. in pyTelegramBotAPI use\n\nNote: 4200 is an example port\n\nNew: There is an asynchronous implementation of telebot. To enable this behaviour, create an instance of AsyncTeleBot instead of TeleBot.\n\nNow, every function that calls the Telegram API is executed in a separate asynchronous task. Using AsyncTeleBot allows you to do the following:\n\nSee more in examples\n\nSometimes you must send messages that exceed 5000 characters. The Telegram API can not handle that many characters in one request, so we need to split the message in multiples. Here is how to do that using the API:\n\nOr you can use the new function to get more meaningful substrings:\n\nThe TeleBot constructor takes the following optional arguments:\n• threaded: True/False (default True). A flag to indicate whether TeleBot should execute message handlers on it's polling Thread.\n\nAs an alternative to the message handlers, one can also register a function as a listener to TeleBot.\n\nNOTICE: handlers won't disappear! Your message will be processed both by handlers and listeners. Also, it's impossible to predict which will work at first because of threading. If you use threaded=False, custom listeners will work earlier, after them handlers will be called. Example:\n\nWhen using webhooks telegram sends one Update per call, for processing it you should call process_new_messages([update.message]) when you recieve it.\n\nThere are some examples using webhooks in the examples/webhook_examples directory.\n\nYou can use the Telebot module logger to log debug info about Telebot. Use to get the logger of the TeleBot module. It is possible to add custom logging Handlers to the logger. Refer to the Python logging module page for more info.\n\nYou can use proxy for request. object will use by call proxies argument.\n\nIf you want to use socket5 proxy you need install dependency and make sure, that you have the latest version of , , , and .\n\nYou can disable or change the interaction with real Telegram server by using\n\nparameter. You can pass there your own function that will be called instead of requests.request.\n\nThen you can use API and proceed requests in your handler code.\n\nWe have a fully asynchronous version of TeleBot. This class is not controlled by threads. Asyncio tasks are created to execute all the stuff.\n\nAs you can see here, keywords are await and async.\n\nAsynchronous tasks depend on processor performance. Many asynchronous tasks can run parallelly, while thread tasks will block each other.\n\nAsyncTeleBot is asynchronous. It uses aiohttp instead of requests module.\n\nSee more examples in our examples folder\n\nBot instances that were idle for a long time might be rejected by the server when sending a message due to a timeout of the last used session. Add to your initialisation to force recreation after 5 minutes without any activity.\n\nJoin the News channel.

For example, you might want to invoke from within your Python code to retrieve files in your project that are tracked in version control. Since any program you can access on your computer can be controlled by , the examples shown here will be applicable to any external program you might want to invoke from your Python code.\n\nincludes several classes and functions, but in this tutorial we’ll cover one of ’s most useful functions: . We’ll review its different uses and main keyword arguments.\n\nTo get the most out of this tutorial, it is recommended to have some familiarity with programming in Python 3. You can review these tutorials for the necessary background information:\n• How To Code in Python 3\n\nYou can use the function to run an external program from your Python code. First, though, you need to import the and modules into your program:\n\nIf you run this, you will receive output like the following:\n• is the absolute path to the Python executable that your program was originally invoked with. For example, might be a path like .\n• is given a list of strings consisting of the components of the command we are trying to run. Since the first string we pass is , we are instructing to execute a new Python program.\n• The component is a command line option that allows you to pass a string with an entire Python program to execute. In our case, we pass a program that prints the string .\n\nYou can think of each entry in the list that we pass to as being separated by a space. For example, translates roughly to . Note that automatically quotes the components of the command before trying to run them on the underlying operating system so that, for example, you can pass a filename that has spaces in it.\n\nNow that we can invoke an external program using , let’s see how we can capture output from that program. For example, this process could be useful if we wanted to use to output all your files currently stored under version control.\n\nLet’s add to our previous example:\n\nIf we run this code, we’ll receive output like the following:\n\nThis example is largely the same as the one introduced in the first section: we are still running a subprocess to print . Importantly, however, we pass the and keyword arguments to .\n\nreturns a object that is bound to . The object includes details about the external program’s exit code and its output. ensures that and are filled in with the corresponding output from the external program. By default, and are bound as bytes, but the keyword argument instructs Python to instead decode the bytes into strings.\n\nIn the output section, is (plus the trailing newline that adds implicitly), and we have no .\n\nLet’s try an example that produces a non-empty value for :\n\nIf we run this code, we receive output like the following:\n\nThis code runs a Python subprocess that immediately raises a . When we inspect the final , we see nothing in and a of our in . This is because by default Python writes the of the unhandled exception to .\n\nSometimes it’s useful to raise an exception if a program we run exits with a bad exit code. Programs that exit with a zero code are considered successful, but programs that exit with a non-zero code are considered to have encountered an error. As an example, this pattern could be useful if we wanted to raise an exception in the event that we run in a directory that wasn’t actually a repository.\n\nWe can use the keyword argument to to have an exception raised if the external program returns a non-zero exit code:\n\nIf we run this code, we receive output like the following:\n\nThis output shows that we ran a subprocess that raised an error, which is printed in in our terminal. Then dutifully raised a on our behalf in our main Python program.\n\nAlternatively, the module also includes the method, which we can invoke for similar effect:\n\nIf we run this code, we’ll receive:\n\nSince we didn’t pass to , we successfully bound a instance to even though our program exited with a non-zero code. Calling , however, raises a because it detects the completed process exited with a bad code.\n\nincludes the argument to allow you to stop an external program if it is taking too long to execute:\n\nIf we run this code, we’ll receive output like the following:\n\nThe subprocess we tried to run used the function to sleep for seconds. However, we passed the keyword argument to to time out our subprocess after second. This explains why our call to ultimately raised a exception.\n\nNote that the keyword argument to is approximate. Python will make a best effort to kill the subprocess after the number of seconds, but it won’t necessarily be exact.\n\nSometimes programs expect input to be passed to them via .\n\nThe keyword argument to allows you to pass data to the of the subprocess. For example:\n\nWe’ll receive output like the following after running this code:\n\nIn this case, we passed the bytes to . Our target subprocess used to read the passed in ( ) and printed it out in our output.\n\nThe keyword argument can be useful if you want to chain multiple calls together passing the output of one program as the input to another.\n\nThe module is a powerful part of the Python standard library that lets you run external programs and inspect their outputs easily. In this tutorial, you have learned to use to control external programs, pass input to them, parse their output, and check their return codes.\n\nThe module exposes additional classes and utilities that we did not cover in this tutorial. Now that you have a baseline, you can use the module’s documentation to learn more about other available classes and utilities."

        "document": "Python subprocess is a powerful module that allows you to execute external commands from within your Python script. It provides a way to interact with the command line and run shell commands, system commands, external scripts, and more. In this comprehensive guide, we will explore the various features and functionalities of the subprocess module, along with best practices and tips for using it effectively.\n\nYou can import it into your Python script using the following line of code:\n\nNow that you have imported the subprocess module let’s dive into running basic commands with the subprocess.\n\nThe subprocess module provides several functions for executing external commands. One of the simplest ways to run a command is by using the `subprocess.run()` function. This function takes the command as a string and executes it. Here’s an example:\n\nIn the above example, we are running the `ls` command to list the files and directories in the current directory. The `shell=True` argument tells the subprocess to use the shell to execute the command. The `capture_output=True` argument captures the output of the command, and the `text=True` argument ensures that the output is returned as a string.\n\nApart from the `subprocess.run()` function, the subprocess module provides other functions for executing external commands. Let’s explore some of them.\n\nThe `subprocess.run()` function is versatile and allows you to run a command and capture its output. It returns a `CompletedProcess` object that contains information about the command’s execution. Here’s an example:\n\nIn the above example, we are running the `echo` command to print “Hello, World!”. The command is passed as a list of strings, where each element represents a part of the command. The output of the command is captured and printed using the `result.stdout` attribute.\n\nThe subprocess module provides various ways to capture the output of a command. In addition to the `subprocess.run()` function, you can use the `subprocess.check_output()` function to capture the output as a byte string, or the `subprocess.PIPE` constant to capture the output as a file-like object. Here’s an example:\n\nIn the above example, we are using the `subprocess.check_output()` function to capture the output of the `ls` command. The `shell=True` argument tells the subprocess to use the shell to execute the command. The output is returned as a byte string, which we decode and print using the `output.decode()` method.\n\nWhen executing external commands, you often need to pass command line arguments. The subprocess module allows you to pass arguments as a list of strings, where each element represents an argument. Here’s an example:\n\nIn the above example, we are passing the arguments “Hello,” and “World!” to the `echo` command. Each argument is represented as a separate element in the list.\n\nThe subprocess module also provides the `subprocess.Popen()` function, which allows you to run commands asynchronously. This means that you can start a command and continue with other tasks without waiting for the command to complete. Here’s an example:\n\nIn the above example, we are using the `subprocess.Popen()` function to start the `ping` command to google.com. The command is started in the background, and we can continue with other tasks while it is running.\n\nIn addition to the basic functionalities, the subprocess module provides advanced techniques for interacting with external commands. Let’s explore some of them.\n\nThe subprocess module allows you to redirect the input and output streams of a command. You can redirect the input from a file or a string, and redirect the output to a file or a variable. Here’s an example:\n\nIn the above example, we are redirecting the input of the `grep` command from a file named “input.txt”. We are also redirecting the output of the `ls` command to a file named “output.txt”.\n\nThe subprocess module allows you to set environment variables for the command’s execution. You can pass a dictionary of environment variables to the `subprocess.run()` function using the `env` argument. Here’s an example:\n\nIn the above example, we are setting the `PATH` environment variable to “/usr/local/bin” for the execution of the `echo` command. The `shell=True` argument tells the subprocess to use the shell to execute the command.\n\nWhen executing external commands, it is important to handle errors and exceptions. The subprocess module provides various ways to handle errors, such as checking the return code of the command, capturing the error output, and raising exceptions. Here’s an example:\n\nIn the above example, we are running an invalid command and using the `check=True` argument to raise an exception if the command fails. We catch the `subprocess.CalledProcessError` exception and print the return code and error output.\n\nThe subprocess module allows you to interact with the process of the executed command. You can send input to the process, receive output from the process, and even terminate the process if needed. Here’s an example:\n\nIn the above example, we are starting a Python interpreter as a subprocess and sending the command `print(‘Hello, World!’)` to it. We then read the output of the process and print it. Finally, we terminate the process using the `process.terminate()` method.\n\nThe subprocess module allows you to run commands in the background, without blocking the execution of your Python script. You can use the `subprocess.Popen()` function with the `subprocess.DEVNULL` constant to redirect the input and output streams to null. Here’s an example:\n\nIn the above example, we are running a Python script named “script.py” in the background. The input, output, and error streams of the script are redirected to null, so they do not interfere with the execution of the main script.\n\nThe subprocess module is widely used in various scenarios. Let’s explore some common use cases for using the Python subprocess.\n\nPython subprocess allows you to run shell commands from within your Python script. This can be useful for automating tasks, executing system commands, and interacting with the command line. Here’s an example:\n\nIn the above example; we are running the `ls` command to list the files and directories in the current directory.\n\nPython subprocess allows you to execute system commands, such as installing packages, updating software, and managing system resources. Here’s an example:\n\nIn the above example, we are using the `apt-get` command to install a package.\n\nThe Python subprocess allows you to run external scripts, such as shell scripts, Python scripts, and other executable scripts. Here’s an example:\n\nIn the above example, we are running a Python script named “script.py”.\n\nPython subprocess allows you to run commands with elevated privileges, such as running commands as an administrator or root user. Here’s an example:\n\nIn the above example, we are running a command with elevated privileges using the `sudo` command.\n\nPython subprocess allows you to run commands that require user input, such as interactive programs and command line prompts. Here’s an example:\n\nIn the above example, we are running the Python interpreter in interactive mode, which allows user input.\n\nBest Practices and Tips for Using Python subprocess\n\nWhen using Python subprocess, it is important to follow best practices and consider certain factors. Here are some tips for using Python subprocess effectively.\n\nWhen executing external commands, it is important to ensure command security and sanitization. Always validate and sanitize user input before passing it to subprocess functions to prevent command injection attacks.\n\nPython subprocess works differently on different operating systems. Take into account the differences in command syntax, environment variables, and system commands when writing cross-platform code.\n\nIn complex applications, managing subprocesses can be challenging. Consider using higher-level libraries and frameworks, such as Celery or asyncio, to manage subprocesses efficiently.\n\nWhen encountering issues with subprocesses, it is important to debug and troubleshoot them effectively. Use logging, error handling, and debugging techniques to identify and resolve any problems.\n\nPython subprocess is a powerful module that allows you to execute external commands from within your Python script. It provides various functionalities, including running commands, capturing output, handling errors, and interacting with the command’s process. By following best practices and considering various factors, you can use Python subprocess effectively in your projects.\n\nReady to supercharge your AI & ML journey?

        "document": "I'm building an apllication which is intended to do a bulk-job processing data within another software. To control the other software automatically I'm using pyautoit, and everything works fine, except for application errors, caused from the external software, which occur from time to time.\n• None It starts the script with the bulk job within a subprocess\n• None It listens to the system event using winevt.EventLog module\n• None In case of an error occurs, it shuts down everything and re-starts the script again.\n\nOk, if an system error event occurs, this event should get handled in a way, that the supprocess gets notified. This notification should then lead to the following action within the subprocess:\n\nWithin the subprocess there's an object controlling everything and continuously collecting generated data. In order to not having to start the whole job from the beginnig, after re-starting the script, this object has to be dumped using pickle (which isn't the problem here!)\n\nListening to the system event from inside the subprocess didn't work. It results in a continuous loop, when calling subprocess.Popen().\n\nSo, my question is how I can either subscribe for system events from inside a childproces, or communicate between the parent and childprocess - means, sending a message like \"hey, an errorocurred\", listening within the subprocess and then creating the dump?\n\nI'm really sorry not being allowed to post any code in this case. But I hope (and actually think), that my description should be understandable. My question is just about what module to use to accomplish this in the best way?\n\nWould be really happy, if somebody could point me into the right direction..."
