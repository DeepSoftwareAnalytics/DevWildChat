        "document": "What Is Documentation in Python?\n\nDocumentation in Python refers to the written text that accompanies a Python software project. This text explains the purpose and use of the code, making it easier for others (and often yourself in the future) to understand and maintain. Python documentation can come in many forms, from inline comments and docstrings within the code itself, to external documentation like user manuals and API references.\n\nPython is particularly well-suited for good documentation practices due to its clean, readable syntax and strong support for docstrings—in-code explanations of functions, methods, and classes. Even Python’s philosophy, expressed in the Zen of Python, encourages code readability and hence, good documentation.\n\nAnother meaning of the term “documentation in Python” is the official documentation of the Python language. Here is a link to the documentation for the latest version of Python 3.\n\nThis is part of a series of articles about code documentation\n\nWhy Documenting Your Python Code Is Important\n\nAs a project grows, keeping track of every piece of code becomes increasingly challenging. Well-written documentation serves as a map, guiding you or other developers through the codebase. It’s particularly useful when hunting down bugs or implementing new features. Without documentation, you’re effectively lost in a sea of code.\n\nFurthermore, documentation in Python also serves as a form of ‘defensive programming’. It helps catch and prevent errors. For instance, Python’s docstrings can include information about a function’s expected input and output types. This helps ensure that the function is used correctly, reducing the likelihood of bugs.\n\nDocumentation also plays a crucial role in onboarding new developers onto a project. Comprehensive documentation enables new developers to quickly understand the system’s architecture, the purpose of various parts of the code, and how they interact. This accelerates the onboarding process, reducing the time it takes for new developers to become productive members of the team.\n\nMoreover, well-documented code fosters an environment of self-reliance. New developers can consult the documentation to answer their questions, rather than relying on others. This not only speeds up their learning process but also minimizes disruptions to the rest of the team.\n\nIn a team setting, developers are often working on different parts of a project simultaneously. Good documentation ensures that everyone understands not just their own code, but the entire codebase. This shared understanding facilitates effective collaboration, preventing conflicts and misunderstandings.\n\nGood documentation also smoothens the code review process. Reviewers can refer to the documentation to better understand the code changes, enabling them to provide more valuable feedback. Consequently, this leads to higher code quality and fewer bugs.\n\nLastly, documentation plays a pivotal role in quality assurance. It provides a clear understanding of how the system is supposed to work, which is invaluable when testing. Testers can refer to the documentation to ensure that the system behaves as expected.\n\nIn addition, documentation can also guide the creation of automated tests. For instance, function docstrings can provide information about the expected inputs and outputs, which can be used to generate unit tests automatically. This not only improves the testing process but also helps maintain high code quality.\n\nRelated content: Read our guide to documentation as code\n\nOne of the simplest ways to document your Python code is through inline comments. These are brief notes written directly into the code, typically on the same line or directly above the code they refer to. Here is the syntax for comments in Python:\n\nInline comments are great for explaining the rationale behind certain code decisions, or for providing a quick summary of what a complex piece of code does.\n\nHowever, it’s important to use inline comments judiciously. Overuse can clutter the code and make it harder to read. As a general rule, your code should be self-explanatory. Use comments to explain the ‘why’ (the reasoning behind the code), not the ‘what’ (what the code is doing).\n\nDocstrings, or documentation strings, are a more powerful documentation tool in Python. They’re multi-line strings placed at the start of functions, classes, and modules that describe what these components do. Here is an example of the use of Docstrings:\n\nDocstrings can include information about the purpose of the function, its inputs and outputs, exceptions it may raise, and more.\n\nPython has a built-in help() function that can display the docstring for any function, class, or module. This makes docstrings a highly accessible form of documentation.\n\nPython 3.5 introduced optional type hints, which allow you to specify the expected type of function arguments and return values. Here is an example of type hints:\n\nIn the example above, the type hints, indicated by List[int] and Tuple[List[int], List[int]], inform the developer that the function expects a list of integers as an argument and will return a tuple of two lists of integers.\n\nThese type hints act as documentation and can also be used for type checking, either at runtime or statically (i.e., without running the code). Type checking can help catch certain types of bugs before the code is even run.\n\nDocumentation generators are tools that automatically create documentation from your code. In Python, the most popular documentation generator is Sphinx. It can generate documentation in various formats (including HTML and PDF) from reStructuredText, a lightweight markup language.\n\nSphinx can also auto-generate API documentation from your code’s docstrings. This makes it a powerful tool for creating comprehensive, professional-quality documentation with minimal effort.\n\nA good docstring should be clear, concise, and informative. It should quickly convey what the function does, without going into too much detail. Avoid jargon and complex language—your goal is to make the function’s purpose understandable to anyone who reads the docstring.\n\nIt’s also good practice to include information about the function’s inputs, outputs, and any exceptions it might raise. If your function has side effects (i.e., it changes some state outside its own scope), be sure to document these as well.\n\nExamples are a powerful way to illustrate how to use a function or class. They provide a concrete demonstration of the code in action, making it easier for others to understand how to use it. Including examples in your docstrings or external documentation can significantly improve their usefulness.\n\nWhen writing examples, ensure they are simple, clear, and representative of typical use cases. Avoid complex or contrived examples, as they can be confusing rather than helpful.\n\nExternal documentation is just as important as inline comments and docstrings. It provides a high-level overview of your project, including its architecture, dependencies, setup instructions, usage guide, and more.\n\nKeep your external documentation well-organized and easy to read. Use clear headings and subheadings, maintain a logical flow, and ensure it’s up-to-date. An out-of-date documentation can be worse than no documentation at all, as it can mislead users and developers.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, all public interfaces of your code should be documented. This includes all public functions, methods, classes, and modules. These are the parts of your code that other people will interact with, so it’s crucial that they understand how to use them.\n\nPrivate interfaces (i.e., parts of your code that are meant to be used only within their own module or class) don’t necessarily need to be documented, although it can still be helpful to do so.\n\nIf your project is intended for a global audience, consider localizing your documentation. This means translating it into multiple languages. While English is the lingua franca of the programming world, not all developers are comfortable with it. Providing localized documentation can make your project more accessible to a global audience.\n\nDocumentation in Python is an indispensable aspect of any software project. It not only enhances code maintainability, making it easier to navigate and understand, but also plays a crucial role in onboarding new developers. With comprehensive documentation, teams can collaborate more effectively, leading to higher code quality and improved productivity.\n\nSwimm’s solution, designed for distinguished engineers, staff engineers, developers, and DevOps teams, offers code-coupled documentation that adapts as code changes, simplifying the documentation process and enhancing the onboarding experience.

        "document": "Welcome to your complete guide to documenting Python code. Whether you’re documenting a small script or a large project, whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned Pythonista, this guide will cover everything you need to know.\n\nWe’ve broken up this tutorial into four major sections:\n• Why Documenting Your Code Is So Important: An introduction to documentation and its importance\n• Commenting vs Documenting Code: An overview of the major differences between commenting and documenting, as well as the appropriate times and ways to use commenting\n• Documenting Your Python Code Base Using Docstrings: A deep dive into docstrings for classes, class methods, functions, modules, packages, and scripts, as well as what should be found within each one\n• Documenting Your Python Projects: The necessary elements and what they should contain for your Python projects\n\nFeel free to read through this tutorial from beginning to end or jump to a section you’re interested in. It was designed to work both ways.\n\nWhy Documenting Your Code Is So Important Hopefully, if you’re reading this tutorial, you already know the importance of documenting your code. But if not, then let me quote something Guido mentioned to me at a recent PyCon: “Code is more often read than written.” When you write code, you write it for two primary audiences: your users and your developers (including yourself). Both audiences are equally important. If you’re like me, you’ve probably opened up old codebases and wondered to yourself, “What in the world was I thinking?” If you’re having a problem reading your own code, imagine what your users or other developers are experiencing when they’re trying to use or contribute to your code. Conversely, I’m sure you’ve run into a situation where you wanted to do something in Python and found what looks like a great library that can get the job done. However, when you start using the library, you look for examples, write-ups, or even official documentation on how to do something specific and can’t immediately find the solution. After searching, you come to realize that the documentation is lacking or even worse, missing entirely. This is a frustrating feeling that deters you from using the library, no matter how great or efficient the code is. Daniele Procida summarized this situation best: “It doesn’t matter how good your software is, because if the documentation is not good enough, people will not use it.“ In this guide, you’ll learn from the ground up how to properly document your Python code from the smallest of scripts to the largest of Python projects to help prevent your users from ever feeling too frustrated to use or contribute to your project.\n\nBefore we can go into how to document your Python code, we need to distinguish documenting from commenting. In general, commenting is describing your code to/for developers. The intended main audience is the maintainers and developers of the Python code. In conjunction with well-written code, comments help to guide the reader to better understand your code and its purpose and design: “Code tells you how; Comments tell you why.” Documenting code is describing its use and functionality to your users. While it may be helpful in the development process, the main intended audience is the users. The following section describes how and when to comment your code. Comments are created in Python using the pound sign ( ) and should be brief statements no longer than a few sentences. Here’s a simple example: According to PEP 8, comments should have a maximum length of 72 characters. This is true even if your project changes the max line length to be greater than the recommended 80 characters. If a comment is going to be greater than the comment char limit, using multiple lines for the comment is appropriate: # A very long statement that just goes on and on and on and on and # never ends until after it's reached the 80 char limit\n• Planning and Reviewing: When you are developing new portions of your code, it may be appropriate to first use comments as a way of planning or outlining that section of code. Remember to remove these comments once the actual coding has been implemented and reviewed/tested:\n• Code Description: Comments can be used to explain the intent of specific sections of code:\n• Algorithmic Description: When algorithms are used, especially complicated ones, it can be useful to explain how the algorithm works or how it’s implemented within your code. It may also be appropriate to describe why a specific algorithm was selected over another.\n• Tagging: The use of tagging can be used to label specific sections of code where known issues or areas of improvement are located. Some examples are: , , and . # TODO: Add condition for when val is None Comments to your code should be kept brief and focused. Avoid using long comments when possible. Additionally, you should use the following four essential rules as suggested by Jeff Atwood:\n• Keep comments as close to the code being described as possible. Comments that aren’t near their describing code are frustrating to the reader and easily missed when updates are made.\n• Don’t use complex formatting (such as tables or ASCII figures). Complex formatting leads to distracting content and can be difficult to maintain over time.\n• Don’t include redundant information. Assume the reader of the code has a basic understanding of programming principles and language syntax.\n• Design your code to comment itself. The easiest way to understand code is by reading it. When you design your code using clear, easy-to-understand concepts, the reader will be able to quickly conceptualize your intent. Remember that comments are designed for the reader, including yourself, to help guide them in understanding the purpose and design of the software. Type hinting was added to Python 3.5 and is an additional form to help the readers of your code. In fact, it takes Jeff’s fourth suggestion from above to the next level. It allows the developer to design and explain portions of their code without commenting. Here’s a quick example: From examining the type hinting, you can immediately tell that the function expects the input to be of a type , or string. You can also tell that the expected output of the function will be of a type , or string, as well. While type hinting helps reduce comments, take into consideration that doing so may also make extra work when you are creating or updating your project documentation. You can learn more about type hinting and type checking from this video created by Dan Bader.\n\nNow that we’ve learned about commenting, let’s take a deep dive into documenting a Python code base. In this section, you’ll learn about docstrings and how to use them for documentation. This section is further divided into the following sub-sections:\n• Docstrings Background: A background on how docstrings work internally within Python\n• Docstring Types: The various docstring “types” (function, class, class method, module, package, and script)\n• Docstring Formats: The different docstring “formats” (Google, NumPy/SciPy, reStructuredText, and Epytext) Documenting your Python code is all centered on docstrings. These are built-in strings that, when configured correctly, can help your users and yourself with your project’s documentation. Along with docstrings, Python also has the built-in function that prints out the objects docstring to the console. Here’s a quick example: Help on class str in module builtins: | Create a new string object from the given object. If encoding or | errors are specified, then the object must expose a data buffer | that will be decoded using the given encoding and error handler. | Otherwise, returns the result of object.__str__() (if defined) How is this output generated? Since everything in Python is an object, you can examine the directory of the object using the command. Let’s do that and see what find: Within that directory output, there’s an interesting property, . If you examine that property, you’ll discover this: Create a new string object from the given object. If encoding or errors are specified, then the object must expose a data buffer that will be decoded using the given encoding and error handler. Otherwise, returns the result of object.__str__() (if defined) Voilà! You’ve found where docstrings are stored within the object. This means that you can directly manipulate that property. However, there are restrictions for builtins: \"I'm a little string doc! Short and stout; here is my input and print me for my out\" File , line , in : Any other custom object can be manipulated: , is it me you're looking for?\" \"A simple function that says hello... Richie style\" Help on function say_hello in module __main__: A simple function that says hello... Richie style Python has one more feature that simplifies docstring creation. Instead of directly manipulating the property, the strategic placement of the string literal directly below the object will automatically set the value. Here’s what happens with the same example as above: \"\"\"A simple function that says hello... Richie style\"\"\" , is it me you're looking for?\" Help on function say_hello in module __main__: A simple function that says hello... Richie style There you go! Now you understand the background of docstrings. Now it’s time to learn about the different types of docstrings and what information they should contain. Docstring conventions are described within PEP 257. Their purpose is to provide your users with a brief overview of the object. They should be kept concise enough to be easy to maintain but still be elaborate enough for new users to understand their purpose and how to use the documented object. In all cases, the docstrings should use the triple-double quote ( ) string format. This should be done whether the docstring is multi-lined or not. At a bare minimum, a docstring should be a quick summary of whatever is it you’re describing and should be contained within a single line: \"\"\"This is a quick summary line used as a description of the object.\"\"\" Multi-lined docstrings are used to further elaborate on the object beyond the summary. All multi-lined docstrings have the following parts:\n• Any further elaboration for the docstring \"\"\"This is the summary line This is the further elaboration of the docstring. Within this section, you can elaborate further on details as appropriate for the situation. Notice that the summary and the elaboration is separated by a blank new # Notice the blank line above. Code should continue on this line. All docstrings should have the same max character length as comments (72 characters). Docstrings can be further broken up into three major categories: Class Docstrings are created for the class itself, as well as any class methods. The docstrings are placed immediately following the class or class method indented by one level: Class docstrings should contain the following information:\n• A brief summary of its purpose and behavior\n• Any public methods, along with a brief description\n• Anything related to the interface for subclassers, if the class is intended to be subclassed The class constructor parameters should be documented within the class method docstring. Individual methods should be documented using their individual docstrings. Class method docstrings should contain the following:\n• A brief description of what the method is and what it’s used for\n• Any arguments (both required and optional) that are passed including keyword arguments\n• Label any arguments that are considered optional or have a default value\n• Any side effects that occur when executing the method\n• Any exceptions that are raised\n• Any restrictions on when the method can be called Let’s take a simple example of a data class that represents an Animal. This class will contain a few class properties, instance properties, a , and a single instance method: A class used to represent an Animal a formatted string to print out what the animal says the sound that the animal makes the number of legs the animal has (default 4) Prints the animals name and what sound it makes The number of legs the animal (default is 4) \"\"\"Prints what the animals name is and what sound it makes. If the argument `sound` isn't passed in, the default Animal The sound the animal makes (default is None) If no sound is set for the animal or passed in as a Package docstrings should be placed at the top of the package’s file. This docstring should list the modules and sub-packages that are exported by the package. Module docstrings are similar to class docstrings. Instead of classes and class methods being documented, it’s now the module and any functions found within. Module docstrings are placed at the top of the file even before any imports. Module docstrings should include the following:\n• A brief description of the module and its purpose\n• A list of any classes, exception, functions, and any other objects exported by the module The docstring for a module function should include the same items as a class method:\n• A brief description of what the function is and what it’s used for\n• Any arguments (both required and optional) that are passed including keyword arguments\n• Label any arguments that are considered optional\n• Any side effects that occur when executing the function\n• Any exceptions that are raised\n• Any restrictions on when the function can be called Scripts are considered to be single file executables run from the console. Docstrings for scripts are placed at the top of the file and should be documented well enough for users to be able to have a sufficient understanding of how to use the script. It should be usable for its “usage” message, when the user incorrectly passes in a parameter or uses the option. If you use , then you can omit parameter-specific documentation, assuming it’s correctly been documented within the parameter of the function. It is recommended to use the for the parameter within ’s constructor. Check out our tutorial on Command-Line Parsing Libraries for more details on how to use and other common command line parsers. Finally, any custom or third-party imports should be listed within the docstrings to allow users to know which packages may be required for running the script. Here’s an example of a script that is used to simply print out the column headers of a spreadsheet: This script allows the user to print to the console all columns in the spreadsheet. It is assumed that the first row of the spreadsheet is the This tool accepts comma separated value files (.csv) as well as excel This script requires that `pandas` be installed within the Python environment you are running this script in. This file can also be imported as a module and contains the following * get_spreadsheet_cols - returns the column headers of the file * main - the main function of the script \"\"\"Gets and prints the spreadsheet's header columns The file location of the spreadsheet A flag used to print the columns to the console (default is a list of strings used that are the header columns \"The spreadsheet file to pring the columns of\" You may have noticed that, throughout the examples given in this tutorial, there has been specific formatting with common elements: , , and . There are specific docstrings formats that can be used to help docstring parsers and users have a familiar and known format. The formatting used within the examples in this tutorial are NumPy/SciPy-style docstrings. Some of the most common formats are the following: Official Python documentation standard; Not beginner friendly but feature rich The selection of the docstring format is up to you, but you should stick with the same format throughout your document/project. The following are examples of each type to give you an idea of how each documentation format looks. \"\"\"Gets and prints the spreadsheet's header columns file_loc (str): The file location of the spreadsheet print_cols (bool): A flag used to print the columns to the console \"\"\"Gets and prints the spreadsheet's header columns :param file_loc: The file location of the spreadsheet :param print_cols: A flag used to print the columns to the console \"\"\"Gets and prints the spreadsheet's header columns The file location of the spreadsheet A flag used to print the columns to the console (default is False) \"\"\"Gets and prints the spreadsheet's header columns @param file_loc: The file location of the spreadsheet @param print_cols: A flag used to print the columns to the console"

        "document": "How to Design a Database for Shopping Cart\n\nDesigning a relational database for a shopping cart system is essential for managing e-commerce transactions efficiently. Such a database needs to handle various entities like products, customers, orders, and payments, while also ensuring data integrity and supporting seamless interactions between users and the online store.\n\nIn this article, we'll delve into the key components and considerations involved in creating a robust shopping cart database.\n\nA shopping cart database plays a pivotal role in facilitating online shopping experiences by storing and managing crucial information related to products, customers, orders, and transactions. By designing a well-structured database, e-commerce businesses can streamline operations, enhance user experience, and ensure the security and integrity of data.\n• Product Management: Efficiently manage product information, including details like name, description, price, and availability.\n• Customer Management: Store customer data such as names, addresses, contact information, and order histories.\n• Order Management: Track orders placed by customers, including details like order IDs, products purchased, quantities, and total amounts.\n• Cart Management: Enable users to add, remove, and update items in their shopping carts before checkout. \n\n\n\nEntities and Attributes for the Shopping Cart Database\n• None Name: Name of the product.\n• None QuantityAvailable: Quantity of the product available in stock.\n• None FirstName: First name of the customer.\n• None LastName: Last name of the customer.\n• None CustomerID (Foreign Key): Reference to the customer placing the order.\n• None OrderDate: Date and time when the order was placed.\n• None OrderID (Foreign Key): Reference to the order containing the item.\n• None ProductID (Foreign Key): Reference to the product being purchased.\n• None Price: Price of the product at the time of purchase.\n• None CustomerID (Foreign Key): Reference to the customer owning the cart.\n• None Each order is associated with one customer (CustomerID in the Order table references CustomerID in the Customer table).\n• None This is a one-to-many relationship, as one customer can place multiple orders.\n• None Each order item is associated with one order (OrderID in the OrderItem table references OrderID in the Order table).\n• None This is a one-to-many relationship, as one order can contain multiple items.\n• None Each shopping cart is associated with one customer (CustomerID in the Cart table references CustomerID in the Customer table).\n• None This is a one-to-one relationship, as each customer has only one active shopping cart at a time.\n\nDesigning a relational database for a shopping cart system involves identifying the entities, defining their attributes, establishing relationships between them, and enforcing data integrity. By following a systematic approach and considering the specific requirements of the e-commerce platform, a well-designed database can support seamless transactions, enhance user experience, and drive business growth."
