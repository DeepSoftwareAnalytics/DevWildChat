        "document": "In the world of modern software development, the ability to perform tasks concurrently is crucial for building efficient and responsive applications. Java provides robust support for multithreading and concurrency, allowing developers to harness the power of multiple threads to achieve better performance. In this guide, we’ll dive deep into the concepts of multithreading and concurrency in Java, providing you with a comprehensive understanding and practical insights.\n\nAt its core, multithreading involves executing multiple threads (smaller units of a process) concurrently, sharing the same resources and running in parallel. This enables applications to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, improving overall responsiveness and efficiency.\n\nModern CPUs are powerful and capable of executing instructions at an incredible speed. However, in traditional single-threaded applications, CPUs often spend a significant amount of time waiting for I/O operations (such as reading/writing from/to disk, network communication, etc.) to complete. Multithreading allows the CPU to switch to another thread while one thread is waiting for I/O, making better use of its processing capacity.\n\nMany applications spend a considerable amount of time waiting for I/O-bound operations. By employing multithreading, you can initiate I/O operations on one thread while other threads continue to perform computations. This approach effectively overlaps computation with I/O, reducing the overall time needed to complete tasks.\n\nWith the rise of multicore processors, modern computers can execute multiple threads in parallel. Multithreading allows you to fully leverage the processing power of these multicore machines, leading to better utilization of available resources and improved application performance.\n\nIn Java, you can create threads using the class or by implementing the interface. Here's how you can do it:\n\nThreads in Java follow a lifecycle that consists of several states, including “new,” “runnable,” “blocked,” “waiting,” and “terminated.” You can control thread states and transitions using methods like , , , and more.\n\nOne of the challenges in multithreading is synchronizing threads that access shared resources. Without proper synchronization, race conditions and other concurrency issues can arise. The keyword and locks help manage access to critical sections of code:\n\nJava provides a rich set of concurrency utilities in the package, including thread pools, executors, and synchronizers. These utilities simplify multithreading and make it easier to manage and coordinate concurrent tasks:\n\nWhen it comes to managing concurrent tasks efficiently and elegantly, the from the package shines as a powerful tool. It abstracts away many complexities associated with manual thread management, allowing developers to focus on task logic and optimal resource utilization. Let's explore how the ExecutorService helps and see it in action with a code snippet.\n• Thread Pool Management: Creating and managing threads manually can be resource-intensive and error-prone. ExecutorService manages a pool of threads, reusing them for executing multiple tasks. This reduces overhead and improves performance.\n• Resource Utilization: With the rise of multicore processors, ExecutorService allows you to fully utilize available CPU cores by running tasks concurrently. This leads to better resource utilization and enhanced application responsiveness.\n• Task Abstraction: Instead of dealing with thread lifecycle management, you focus on defining tasks. You submit tasks to the ExecutorService, which handles their execution on available threads.\n• Scalability: Different implementations of ExecutorService offer scalability options. You can choose a fixed-size thread pool, a dynamically resizable pool, or even a single-threaded executor based on your application’s requirements.\n\nUsing ExecutorService: An Example\n\nLet’s see the power of ExecutorService in action with a simple code snippet. In this example, we’ll use the method to create a fixed-size thread pool and submit tasks for execution.\n\nIn this example, the method creates a thread pool with four threads. The loop submits ten tasks to the executor, which efficiently manages their execution on the available threads. Once all tasks are complete, the executor is gracefully shut down.\n\nMultithreading and concurrency are essential concepts in Java that allow developers to create responsive and high-performance applications. By understanding thread creation, synchronization, and the use of concurrency utilities, you can unlock the full potential of your Java programs. With the power of multithreading, your applications can efficiently perform tasks in parallel, leading to improved user experiences and better resource utilization.\n\nRemember to explore further resources, experiment with different scenarios, and practice writing multithreaded applications to deepen your understanding of these critical concepts.\n• Java Concurrency in Practice by Brian Goetz et al."

        "document": "Since it is right there in the title of this book, the following sentence shouldn’t come as any surprise: Concurrent programming is still more art than science. This chapter gives eight simple rules that you can add to your toolkit of threading design methods. I’ve tried to organize the rules in a semichronological way, but there’s no hard and fast order to the rules. It’s like being confronted with, “No running by the pool,” and, “No diving in the shallow end.” Both good ideas, but not diving can come before not running or vice versa.\n\nBy following these rules, you will have more success in writing the best and most efficient threaded implementation of your applications. You may recognize some of these, since I’ve mentioned a few of them in previous chapters. In upcoming chapters, when discussing the design and implementation of specific algorithms, I’ll try to drop in a relevant reference to one or more of these eight rules to show that they’re not just here to fill out an extra chapter.\n\nI’ve already covered this first rule seven ways to Sunday, but since it’s the crux of the whole matter, it bears repeating at least one more time. You can’t execute anything concurrently unless the operations that would be executed can be run independently of each other. I can easily think of different real-world instances of independent actions being performed to satisfy a single goal. Consider, for example, a DVD rental warehouse. Orders for movies are collected and then distributed to the workers, who go out to where all the disks are stored and find copies to satisfy their assigned orders. When one worker pulls out a classic musical comedy, it does not interfere with another worker who is looking for the latest science fiction masterpiece, nor will it interfere with a worker trying to locate episodes from the second season of a popular crime drama series (I assume that any conflicts resulting from unavailable inventory have been dealt with before orders were transmitted to the warehouse). Also, the packaging and mailing of each order will not interfere with disk searches or the shipping and handling of any other order. There are cases in which you will have exclusively sequential computations that cannot be made concurrent; many of these will be dependencies between loop iterations or steps that must be carried out in a specific order. A list of common situations was covered earlier in What’s Not Parallel.\n\nRule 2: Implement Concurrency at the Highest Level Possible There are two directions you can take when approaching the threading of a serial code. These are bottom-up and top-down. When initially analyzing your code, you are looking for the computational hotspots that account for the most execution time. Running those portions in parallel will give you the best chance of achieving the maximum performance possible. In a bottom-up approach, you consider threading the hotspots in your code directly. If this is not possible, search up the call stack of the application to determine whether there is another place in the code that can execute the hotspots in parallel. If your hotspot is the innermost loop of a nested loop structure, examine each successive layer of loop nesting, from the innermost to the outermost, to see whether that level can be made concurrent. Even if it is possible to employ concurrency at the hotspot code, you should still look to see whether it would be possible to implement that concurrency at a point in the code higher up in the call stack. This can increase the granularity of the execution done by each thread. To illustrate this rule, consider threading a video encoding application. If your hotspot is the computation of individual pixels, you can look to parallelize the loop(s) that deal with each pixel computation within a single frame of video. Looking further “up” from this, you might find that the loop over the frames of video can be executed concurrently by independently processing groups of frames. If the video encoding application is expected to process multiple videos, expressing your concurrency by assigning a different stream to each thread will be the highest level of possible concurrency. The other approach to threading is top-down, where you first consider the whole application and what the computation is coded to accomplish (all the parts of the application that combine to realize that computation). While there is no obvious concurrency, distill the parts of the computation that still contain execution of the hotspot into successively smaller parts until you can identify independent computations. For the video encoding application, if your hotspot is the computation of individual pixels, the top-down approach would first consider that the application handles encoding of multiple, independent video streams (which all include the pixel computations). If you can parallelize the application there, you’ve found your highest level. If not, working “down” to the individual pixel will take you through frames within a single stream and then to pixels within a frame. The objective of this rule is to find the highest level where concurrency can be implemented so that your hotspot of code will be executed concurrently. This is all predicated on the belief that “higher” levels in the layers of your algorithms will equal more (independent) work, much like the way that layers of a parfait accumulate mass the higher up in the glass you go. Placing concurrency at the highest possible level around a hotspot is one of the best ways to achieve that all-important coarse-grained division of work to be assigned to threads.\n\nRule 3: Plan Early for Scalability to Take Advantage of Increasing Numbers of Cores As I’m writing this, quad-core processors are becoming the default multicore chip. The number of cores available in future processors will only increase. Thus, you should plan for such processor increases within your software. Scalability is the measure of an application’s ability to handle changes, typically increases, in system resources (e.g., number of cores, memory size, bus speed) or data set sizes. In the face of more cores being available, you must write flexible code that can take advantage of different numbers of cores. To paraphrase C. Northcote Parkinson, “Data expands to fill the processing power available.” This means that as the amount of computational power increases (more cores), the more likely it will be that the data to be processed will expand. There are always more computations to be done. Whether it is increasing the model fidelity in scientific simulations, processing an HD stream instead of standard video, or searching through multiple and larger databases, if you are given additional processing resources, someone will always have more data to process. Designing and implementing concurrency by data decomposition methods will give you more scalable solutions. Task decomposition solutions will suffer from the fact that the number of independent functions or code segments in an application is likely limited and fixed during execution. After each independent task has a thread and core to execute on, increasing the number of threads to take advantage of more cores will not increase performance of the application. Since data sizes are more likely to increase than the number of independent computations in an application, data decomposition designs will have the best chance for scalability. Even though an application has been written with threads assigned to independent functions, when the input workload increases, you may still be able to utilize more threads. Consider building a grocery store where there are a finite number of separate tasks to be done. If the developer buys adjacent land and the floor space of the store to be built is doubled, you can expect extra workers to be assigned within some of those tasks. That is, extra painters, extra roofers, extra floor tilers, and extra electricians can be used. Therefore, you should be aware of the data decomposition possibilities that can arise from increased data sets, even within solutions that have been decomposed by tasks, and plan for the use of extra threads on extra cores.\n\nRule 4: Make Use of Thread-Safe Libraries Wherever Possible If your hotspot computations can be executed through a library call, you should strongly consider using an equivalent library function instead of executing handwritten code. Even for serial applications, it’s never a good idea to “reinvent the wheel” by writing code that performs calculations already encapsulated by optimized library routines. Many libraries, such as the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) and Intel Integrated Performance Primitives (IPP), have functions that are threaded to take advantage of multicore processors. Even more important than using threaded library routines, though, is ensuring that all library calls used are thread-safe. If you have replaced the hotspot in your serial code with a call to a library function, it may still be the case that some point higher in the call tree of your application can be divided into independent computations. When you have concurrent computations executing library function calls, especially third-party libraries, routines that reference and update shared variables within the library may cause data races. Check the library documentation for the thread-safety of any library you are using within concurrent execution. When writing and using your own library routines that will be executed concurrently, be sure the routines are reentrant. If this is not possible, you will need to add synchronization in order to protect access to shared resources.\n\nRule 5: Use the Right Threading Model If threaded libraries are insufficient to cover all the concurrency of an application and you must employ user-controlled threads, don’t use explicit threads if an implicit threading model (e.g., OpenMP or Intel Threading Building Blocks) has all the functionality you need. Explicit threads do allow for finer control of the threading implementation. However, if you are only parallelizing compute-intensive loops or don’t need the extra flexibility you can get with explicit threads, there’s probably no reason to do more work than necessary. The more complex the implementation, the easier it will be to make a mistake and the harder it will be to maintain such code later. OpenMP is focused on data decomposition methods, especially targeted to threading loops that range over large data sets. Even if this is the only type of parallelism that you can introduce into an application, there may be external requirements (such as engineering practices dictated by your employer or management preferences) that will prohibit your use of OpenMP. In that case, you will need to implement your threading with an approved (explicit) model. In such a situation, I recommend that you use OpenMP to prototype the planned concurrency and estimate the potential performance gains, possible scalability, and how much effort will be needed to thread the serial code with explicit threads.\n\nRule 6: Never Assume a Particular Order of Execution With serial computations, it is easy to predict the statement that will be executed following any other statement in a program. On the other hand, execution order of threads is nondeterministic and controlled by the OS scheduler. This means that there is no reliable way of predicting the order of threads running from one execution to another, or even which thread will be scheduled to run next. This is done primarily to hide execution latency within an application, especially when run on a system with fewer cores than threads. If a thread blocks because it needs memory that is not located in cache or to process an I/O request, the scheduler will swap out the blocked thread and swap in a thread that is ready to run. Data races are a direct result of this scheduling nondeterminism. If you assume that one thread will write a value into a shared variable before another thread will read that value, you may be right all of the time, you may be right some of the time, or you may be right none of the time. Sometimes, if you’re lucky, the order of thread execution remains unchanged on a specific platform each and every time you run an application. Every difference between systems (bit locations on the disk or memory speed or frequency of the AC power coming out of the wall sockets) has the potential to alter the thread schedule. Code that relies on a particular order of execution among threads that is enforced through nothing more than positive thinking may be plagued by problems such as data races and deadlock. From a performance perspective, it is best to allow threads to run as unencumbered as possible, like greyhounds or thoroughbreds in a race. Don’t try to enforce a particular order of execution unless it is absolutely necessary. You need to recognize those times when it is absolutely necessary, and implement some form of synchronization to coordinate the execution order of threads relative to each other. Consider a relay race team. The first runner starts off running as fast as possible. However, to successfully complete the race, the second, third, and anchor runners must wait to receive the baton before they can begin to run their assigned portions of the race. The baton passing is a synchronization between consecutive runners that controls the order of “execution” between stages in the race.\n\nRule 7: Use Thread-Local Storage Whenever Possible or Associate Locks to Specific Data Synchronization is overhead that does not contribute to the furtherance of the computation, except to guarantee the correct answers are produced from the parallel execution of an application. Synchronization is a necessary evil. Even so, you should actively seek to keep the amount of synchronization to a minimum. You can do this by using storage that is local to threads or using exclusive memory locations (such as an array element indexed by thread ID). Temporary work variables are rarely shared between threads, and should be declared or allocated locally to each thread. Variables that hold partial results for each thread should also be local to threads. Combining the partial results into a shared location will require some synchronization. Ensuring that the shared updates are done as infrequently as possible will keep the amount of overhead to a minimum. If you are using explicit threads, you can use the available thread-local storage APIs to enable the persistence of data local to threads from one threaded region to another or from one threaded function call to the next execution of the same function. If local storage for each thread is not a valid option and you must coordinate access to shared resources through synchronization objects (such as a lock), be sure to properly associate (or “attach”) locks to data items. The easiest way to do this is to have a one to one (1:1) relationship of locks to data items. If you have multiple shared variables that are always accessed together, use a single lock to allow exclusive access to all critical regions involving these variables. In later chapters, I’ll discuss some of the tradeoffs and alternative synchronization techniques that you can employ, especially if you have to protect access to a large collection of data (for example, an array of 10,000 items). However you decide to associate locks with data items, never associate more than one lock to a single data object. Segal’s Law states, “A man with a watch knows what time it is. A man with two watches is never sure.” If two different lock objects—say, and —protect access to the same variable, one part of the code may use for access while another section of code can use . Threads executing in these two code portions will create a data race, since each will assume it has exclusive access to the contested data.\n\nRule 8: Dare to Change the Algorithm for a Better Chance of Concurrency For comparing performance of applications, both serial and concurrent, the bottom line is wall clock execution time. When choosing between two or more algorithms, programmers may rely on the asymptotic order of execution. This metric will almost always correlate with an application’s relative performance to another. That is, with everything else held constant, an application that uses an O(n log n) algorithm (like Quicksort) will run faster than an O(n2) algorithm (such as selection sort) and will generate the same results. In concurrent applications, algorithms with a better asymptotic order of execution will run faster, too. Nonetheless, there will be times when the best serial algorithm will not be amenable to parallelization. If you cannot easily turn a hotspot into threaded code (and you can’t find a point higher in the call stack of the hotspot that can be made concurrent), you should consider using a suboptimal serial algorithm to transform, rather than the algorithm currently in the code. For example, consider the linear algebra operation for the multiplication of two square matrixes. Strassen’s Algorithm has one of the best asymptotic orders of execution, O(n2.81). This is better than the O(n3) of the traditional triple-nested loop algorithm. Strassen’s method divides up each of the matrixes into four chunks (or submatrixes) and uses seven recursive calls to multiply the n/2 × n/2 submatrixes. To parallelize these recursive calls, you could create a new thread to execute each of the seven independent submatrix multiplications. The number of threads will increase exponentially (much like the wives, sacks, cats, and kittens coming from St. Ives). As the submatrixes get smaller and smaller, the granularity of the assigned work given to a newly created thread will get finer and finer. When the submatrixes achieve a given size, switch to a serial algorithm. A much easier means to parallelize matrix multiplication is to use the asymptotically inferior triple-nested loop algorithm. There are several ways to perform a data decomposition on the matrixes (divide by rows, divide by columns, or divide by blocks) and assign the necessary computations to threads. You can do this using OpenMP pragmas at one of the loop levels or by using explicit threads that implement the division of the loop indexes as needed. Less code modification is required for the simpler serial algorithm, and the structure of the code would likely be left more intact than it would be if you attempted to thread Strassen’s Algorithm. Better yet, follow Simple Rule 4 and use a concurrent library function that performs the matrix-matrix multiplication."

        "document": "Many projects I work on have poor threading implementations and I am the sucker who has to track these down. Is there an accepted best way to handle threading. My code is always waiting for an event that never fires.\n\nLearning to write multi-threaded programs correctly is extremely difficult and time consuming. So the first step is: replace the implementation with one that doesn't use multiple threads at all. Then carefully put threading back in if, and only if, you discover a genuine need for it, when you've figured out some very simple safe ways to do so. A non-threaded implementation that works reliably is far better than a broken threaded implementation. When you're ready to start, favour designs that use thread-safe queues to transfer work items between threads and take care to ensure that those work items are accessed only by one thread at a time. Try to avoid just spraying blocks around your code in the hope that it will become thread-safe. It doesn't work. Eventually, two code paths will acquire the same locks in a different order, and everything will grind to a halt (once every two weeks, on a customer's server). This is especially likely if you combine threads with firing events, and you hold the lock while you fire the event - the handler may take out another lock, and now you have a pair of locks held in a particular order. What if they're taken out in the opposite order in some other situation? In short, this is such a big and difficult subject that I think it is potentially misleading to give a few pointers in a short answer and say \"Off you go!\" - I'm sure that's not the intention of the many learned people giving answers here, but that is the impression many get from summarised advice. Here is a very nicely worded summary from this site: Multithreading also comes with disadvantages. The biggest is that it can lead to vastly more complex programs. Having multiple threads does not in itself create complexity; it's the interaction between the threads that creates complexity. This applies whether or not the interaction is intentional, and can result long development cycles, as well as an ongoing susceptibility to intermittent and non-reproducable bugs. For this reason, it pays to keep such interaction in a multi-threaded design simple – or not use multithreading at all – unless you have a peculiar penchant for re-writing and debugging! The traditional way of dealing with concurrency by letting a bunch of threads loose in a single address space and then using locks to try to cope with the resulting data races and coordination problems is probably the worst possible in terms of correctness and comprehensibility.\n\nAt the risk of seeming argumentative, comments like these just bother me: Learning to write multi-threaded programs correctly is extremely difficult and time consuming. Threads should be avoided when possible... It is practically impossible to write software that does anything significant without leveraging threads in some capacity. If you are on Windows, open your Task Manager, enable the Thread Count column, and you can probably count on one hand the number of processes that are using a single thread. Yes, one should not simply use threads for the sake of using threads nor should it be done cavalierly, but frankly, I believe these cliches are used too often. If I had to boil multithreaded programming down for the true novice, I would say this:\n• Before jumping into it, first understand that the the class boundary is not the same as a thread boundary. For example, if a callback method on your class is called by another thread (e.g., the AsyncCallback delegate to the TcpListener.BeginAcceptTcpClient() method), understand that the callback executes on that other thread. So even though the callback occurs on the same object, you still have to synchronize access to the members of the object within the callback method. Threads and classes are orthogonal; it is important to understand this point.\n• Identify what data needs to be shared between threads. Once you have defined the shared data, try to consolidate it into a single class if possible.\n• Limit the places where the shared data can be written and read. If you can get this down to one place for writing and one place for reading, you will be doing yourself a tremendous favor. This is not always possible, but it is a nice goal to shoot for.\n• Obviously make sure you synchronize access to the shared data using the Monitor class or the lock keyword.\n• If possible, use a single object to synchronize your shared data regardless of how many different shared fields there are. This will simplify things. However, it may also overly constrain things too, in which case, you may need a synchronization object for each shared field. And at this point, using immutable classes becomes very handy.\n• If you have one thread that needs to signal another thread(s), I would strongly recommend using the ManualResetEvent class to do this instead of using events/delegates. To sum up, I would say that threading is not difficult, but it can be tedious. Still, a properly threaded application will be more responsive, and your users will be most appreciative. EDIT: There is nothing \"extremely difficult\" about ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(), asynchronous delegates, the various BeginXXX/EndXXX method pairs, etc. in C#. If anything, these techniques make it much easier to accomplish various tasks in a threaded fashion. If you have a GUI application that does any heavy database, socket, or I/O interaction, it is practically impossible to make the front-end responsive to the user without leveraging threads behind the scenes. The techniques I mentioned above make this possible and are a breeze to use. It is important to understand the pitfalls, to be sure. I simply believe we do programmers, especially younger ones, a disservice when we talk about how \"extremely difficult\" multithreaded programming is or how threads \"should be avoided.\" Comments like these oversimplify the problem and exaggerate the myth when the truth is that threading has never been easier. There are legitimate reasons to use threads, and cliches like this just seem counterproductive to me.\n\nYou may be interested in something like CSP, or one of the other theoretical algebras for dealing with concurrency. There are CSP libraries for most languages, but if the language wasn't designed for it, it requires a bit of discipline to use correctly. But ultimately, every kind of concurrency/threading boils down to some fairly simple basics: Avoid shared mutable data, and understand exactly when and why each thread may have to block while waiting for another thread. (In CSP, shared data simply doesn't exist. Each thread (or process in CSP terminology) is only allowed to communicate with others through blocking message-passing channels. Since there is no shared data, race conditions go away. Since message passing is blocking, it becomes easy to reason about synchronization, and literally prove that no deadlocks can occur.) Another good practice, which is easier to retrofit into existing code is to assign a priority or level to every lock in your system, and make sure that the following rules are followed consistently:\n• While holding a lock at level N, you may only acquire new locks of lower levels\n• Multiple locks at the same level must be acquired at the same time, as a single operation, which always tries to acquire all the requested locks in the same global order (Note that any consistent order will do, but any thread that tries to acquire one or more locks at level N, must do acquire them in the same order as any other thread would do anywhere else in the code.) Following these rules mean that it is simply impossible for a deadlock to occur. Then you just have to worry about mutable shared data.\n\nLooking for a design pattern when dealing with threads is the really best approach to start with. It's too bad that many people don't try it, instead attempting to implement less or more complex multithreaded constructs on their own. I would probably agree with all opinions posted so far. In addition, I'd recommend to use some existing more coarse-grained frameworks, providing building blocks rather than simple facilities like locks, or wait/notify operations. For Java, it would be simply the built-in package, which gives you ready-to-use classes you can easily combine to achieve a multithreaded app. The big advantage of this is that you avoid writing low-level operations, which results in hard-to-read and error-prone code, in favor of a much clearer solution. From my experience, it seems that most concurrency problems can be solved in Java by using this package. But, of course, you always should be careful with multithreading, it's challenging anyway.\n\nAdding to the points that other folks have already made here: Some developers seem to think that \"almost enough\" locking is good enough. It's been my experience that the opposite can be true -- \"almost enough\" locking can be worse than enough locking. Imagine thread A locking resource R, using it, and then unlocking it. A then uses resource R' without a lock. Meanwhile, thread B tries to access R while A has it locked. Thread B is blocked until thread A unlocks R. Then the CPU context switches to thread B, which accesses R, and then updates R' during its time slice. That update renders R' inconsistent with R, causing a failure when A tries to access it. Test on as many different hardware and OS architectures as possible. Different CPU types, different numbers of cores and chips, Windows/Linux/Unix, etc. The first developer who worked with multi-threaded programs was a guy named Murphy.\n\nWell, everyone thus far has been Windows / .NET centric, so I'll chime in with some Linux / C. Avoid futexes at all costs(PDF), unless you really, really need to recover some of the time spent with mutex locks. I am currently pulling my hair out with Linux futexes. I don't yet have the nerve to go with practical lock free solutions, but I'm rapidly approaching that point out of pure frustration. If I could find a good, well documented and portable implementation of the above that I could really study and grasp, I'd probably ditch threads completely. I have come across so much code lately that uses threads which really should not, its obvious that someone just wanted to profess their undying love of POSIX threads when a single (yes, just one) fork would have done the job. I wish that I could give you some code that 'just works', 'all the time'. I could, but it would be so silly to serve as a demonstration (servers and such that start threads for each connection). In more complex event driven applications, I have yet (after some years) to write anything that doesn't suffer from mysterious concurrency issues that are nearly impossible to reproduce. So I'm the first to admit, in that kind of application, threads are just a little too much rope for me. They are so tempting and I always end up hanging myself."

A quick tutorial can be found in OMG's article \"Concurrency in UML\".\n\nHere the main tools for modelling concurrency:\n• None Activity diagrams are the first diagram that comes to mind, as they are meant to express flows of activity, including cucurrent flows. They provide for example forks and joins, and even allow to highlight visually concurrency using partitions (swim lanes). Moreover the semantics of activity diagrams is rooted in petri nets, which was the main tool for modelling concurrent algorithms and distributed systems before UML.\n• None sequence diagrams are also a vey usefull diagram for modelling concurrency. First, if active objects are used, their lifelines is a powerful visual tool for showing interaction between concurrent threads. But combined fragments allow to specify elements of concurrency for all kind of objects, in particular with and , but also with and as these impose constraints on concurrency.\n\nOther diagrams can help as well, although they are not sufficient on their own to model concurrency:\n• state diagrams can support concurrency with orthogonal states, forks and joins. But is not sufficient, as orthogonal states are also frequent without any concurrency.\n• timing diagrams allow to visualise several lifelines with a specific focus on timing. This is not very usefull for modelling concurrency in behavior, but can be practical to visualise some specific scenarios.\n• class diagram support concurrency with active classes i.e. classes having their instantiation with build-in concurrency."

        "document": "Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose modeling language. The main aim of UML is to define a standard way to visualize the way a system has been designed. It is quite similar to blueprints used in other fields of engineering. UML is not a programming language, it is rather a visual language.\n\nUnified Modeling Language (UML) is a standardized visual modeling language that is a versatile, flexible, and user-friendly method for visualizing a system’s design. Software system artifacts can be specified, visualized, built, and documented with the use of UML.\n• None We use UML diagrams to show the\n• None UML helps software engineers, businessmen, and system architects with modeling, design, and analysis.\n\n2. Why do we need UML?\n\nWe need UML (Unified Modeling Language) to visually represent and communicate complex system designs, facilitating better understanding and collaboration among stakeholders. Below is why we need UML:\n• None Complex applications need collaboration and planning from multiple teams and hence require a clear and concise way to communicate amongst them.\n• None Businessmen do not understand code. So UML becomes essential to communicate with non-programmers about essential requirements, functionalities, and processes of the system.\n• None A lot of time is saved down the line when teams can visualize processes, user interactions, and the static structure of the system.\n\nUML is linked with object-oriented design and analysis. UML makes use of elements and forms associations between them to form diagrams. Diagrams in UML can be broadly classified as:\n\nStructural UML diagrams are visual representations that depict the static aspects of a system, including its classes, objects, components, and their relationships, providing a clear view of the system’s architecture. Structural UML diagrams include the following types:\n\nThe most widely use UML diagram is the class diagram. It is the building block of all object oriented software systems. We use class diagrams to depict the static structure of a system by showing system’s classes, their methods and attributes. Class diagrams also help us identify relationship between different classes or objects.\n\nWe use composite structure diagrams to represent the internal structure of a class and its interaction points with other parts of the system.\n• None A composite structure diagram represents relationship between parts and their configuration which determine how the classifier (class, a component, or a deployment node) behaves.\n• None They represent internal structure of a structured classifier making the use of parts, ports, and connectors.\n• None We can also model collaborations using composite structure diagrams.\n• None They are similar to class diagrams except they represent individual parts in detail as compared to the entire class.\n\nAn Object Diagram can be referred to as a screenshot of the instances in a system and the relationship that exists between them. Since object diagrams depict behaviour when objects have been instantiated, we are able to study the behaviour of the system at a particular instant.\n• None An object diagram is similar to a class diagram except it shows the instances of classes in the system.\n• None We depict actual classifiers and their relationships making the use of class diagrams.\n• None On the other hand, an Object Diagram represents specific instances of classes and relationships between them at a point of time.\n\nComponent diagrams are used to represent how the physical components in a system have been organized. We use them for modelling implementation details.\n• None Component Diagrams depict the structural relationship between software system elements and help us in understanding if functional requirements have been covered by planned development.\n• None Component Diagrams become essential to use when we design and build complex systems.\n• None Interfaces are used by components of the system to communicate with each other.\n\nDeployment Diagrams are used to represent system hardware and its software. It tells us what hardware components exist and what software components run on them.\n• None We illustrate system architecture as distribution of software artifacts over distributed targets.\n• None An artifact is the information that is generated by system software.\n• None They are primarily used when a software is being used, distributed or deployed over multiple machines with different configurations.\n\nWe use Package Diagrams to depict how packages and their elements have been organized. A package diagram simply shows us the dependencies between different packages and internal composition of packages.\n• None Packages help us to organise UML diagrams into meaningful groups and make the diagram easy to understand.\n• None They are primarily used to organise class and use case diagrams.\n\nBehavioral UML diagrams are visual representations that depict the dynamic aspects of a system, illustrating how objects interact and behave over time in response to events.\n\nA state diagram is used to represent the condition of the system or part of the system at finite instances of time. It’s a behavioral diagram and it represents the behavior using finite state transitions.\n• None State diagrams are also referred to as State machines State-chart Diagrams\n• None These terms are often used interchangeably. So simply, a state diagram is used to model the dynamic behavior of a class in response to time and changing external stimuli.\n\nWe use Activity Diagrams to illustrate the flow of control in a system. We can also use an activity diagram to refer to the steps involved in the execution of a use case.\n• None We model sequential and concurrent activities using activity diagrams. So, we basically depict workflows visually using an activity diagram.\n• None An activity diagram focuses on condition of flow and the sequence in which it happens.\n• None We describe or depict what causes a particular event using an activity diagram.\n\nUse Case Diagrams are used to depict the functionality of a system or a part of a system. They are widely used to illustrate the functional requirements of the system and its interaction with external agents(actors).\n• None A use case is basically a diagram representing different scenarios where the system can be used.\n• None A use case diagram gives us a high level view of what the system or a part of the system does without going into implementation details. ‘\n\nA sequence diagram simply depicts interaction between objects in a sequential order i.e. the order in which these interactions take place.\n• None We can also use the terms event diagrams or event scenarios to refer to a sequence diagram.\n• None Sequence diagrams describe how and in what order the objects in a system function.\n• None These diagrams are widely used by businessmen and software developers to document and understand requirements for new and existing systems.\n\nA Communication Diagram (known as Collaboration Diagram in UML 1.x) is used to show sequenced messages exchanged between objects.\n• None A communication diagram focuses primarily on objects and their relationships.\n• None We can represent similar information using Sequence diagrams, however communication diagrams represent objects and links in a free form.\n\nTiming Diagram are a special form of Sequence diagrams which are used to depict the behavior of objects over a time frame. We use them to show time and duration constraints which govern changes in states and behavior of objects.\n\nAn Interaction Overview Diagram (IOD) is a type of UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram that illustrates the flow of interactions between various elements in a system or process. It provides a high-level overview of how interactions occur, including the sequence of actions, decisions, and interactions between different components or objects.\n\nExamples of object-oriented concepts in UML diagrams include classes, objects, inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism. These concepts improve modularity and clarity by offering an orderly way to show complex systems.\n• Class : An object’s structure and behavior are defined by its class, which serves as a blueprint.\n• Objects : We may divide complex systems into smaller, more manageable components by using objects. Because of its modularity, we can concentrate on easily understood components and develop the system gradually.\n• Inheritance : Child classes can inherit the characteristics and functions of their parent classes.\n• Abstraction : The main characteristics of a system or object are highlighted in UML abstraction, while extraneous details are ignored. Stakeholder communication and understanding are improved by this simplification.\n• Encapsulation : Encapsulation is the process of integrating data and restricting external access in order to maintain the integrity of the data.\n• Polymorphism : Flexibility in their use is made possible by polymorphism, the capacity of functions or entities to take on multiple forms.\n• None Software development methodologies like agile have been incorporated and scope of original UML specification has been broadened.\n• None Originally UML specified 9 diagrams. UML 2.x has increased the number of diagrams from 9 to 13. The four diagrams that were added are : timing diagram, communication diagram, interaction overview diagram and composite structure diagram. UML 2.x renamed statechart diagrams to state machine diagrams.\n• None UML 2.x added the ability to decompose software system into components and sub-components.\n\nThere are several tools available for creating Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams, which are commonly used in software development to visually represent system architecture, design, and implementation. Here are some popular UML diagram creating tools:\n• Lucidchart: Lucidchart is a web-based diagramming tool that supports UML diagrams. It’s user-friendly and collaborative, allowing multiple users to work on diagrams in real-time.\n• Draw.io: Draw.io is a free, web-based diagramming tool that supports various diagram types, including UML. It integrates with various cloud storage services and can be used offline.\n• Visual Paradigm: Visual Paradigm provides a comprehensive suite of tools for software development, including UML diagramming. It offers both online and desktop versions and supports a wide range of UML diagrams.\n• StarUML: StarUML is an open-source UML modeling tool with a user-friendly interface. It supports the standard UML 2.x diagrams and allows users to customize and extend its functionality through plugins.\n\nCreating Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams involves a systematic process that typically includes the following steps:\n• Step 1: Identify the Purpose:\n• None Decide on the objective for which the UML diagram is being made. Among the many applications for the many types of UML diagrams are requirements collection, system architecture development, and class relationship documentation.\n• Step 2: Identify Elements and Relationships:\n• None Choose which crucial elements—classes, objects, use cases, etc.—should be included in the diagram, along with their relationships.\n• Step 3: Select the Appropriate UML Diagram Type:\n• None Select the type of UML diagram that best suits your modeling requirements. Class diagrams, use case diagrams, sequence diagrams, activity diagrams, and more are examples of common forms.\n• Step 4: Create a Rough Sketch:\n• None A basic sketch on paper or a whiteboard can be useful before utilizing a UML modeling tool. This can assist you in seeing how the elements are arranged and related to one another.\n• Step 5: Choose a UML Modeling Tool:\n• None Choose a UML modeling tool based on your needs. Numerous offline and online applications are available with features for making and modifying UML diagrams.\n• Step 6: Create the Diagram:\n• None Create a new project or diagram using the UML modeling tool of your choice. Start by adding components to the diagram, such as actors, classes, and use cases, and then link them together with the proper relationships, such as dependencies and associations.\n• Step 7: Define Element Properties:\n• None Give each diagram element the appropriate qualities and attributes. Use case specifics, class characteristics and methods, and any other information unique to the diagram type may be included.\n• Step 8: Add Annotations and Comments:\n• None By using annotations, remarks, and clarifying notes, you can improve the diagram’s readability.\n• Step 9: Validate and Review:\n• None Check the diagram for completeness and accuracy. Make that the elements, limitations, and linkages appropriately depict the system or process that is intended.\n• Step 10: Refine and Iterate:\n• None Refine the diagram based on feedback and additional insights. UML diagrams are often created iteratively as the understanding of the system evolves.\n\nSystem design can be visually represented and documented with the help of the Unified Modeling Language (UML). Best practices must be followed in order to produce UML diagrams that are both useful and significant. UML best practices include the following:\n• Understand the Audience : Consider who will view your UML diagrams as you create them. Whether your audience consists of developers, architects, or stakeholders, make sure the type and degree of detail of the diagram meet their needs.\n• Keep Diagrams Simple and Focused : Make sure your diagrams are as simple as possible. Each one need to draw attention to a certain aspect of the system or illustrate a particular link.\n• Use Consistent Naming Conventions : Use clear and consistent names for classes, objects, attributes, and methods. Good naming helps everyone understand the diagrams better.\n• Follow Standard UML Notations : Stick to standard UML symbols and notations. This consistency makes it easier for anyone familiar with UML to understand your diagrams.\n• Keep Relationships Explicit : Clearly define and label how different elements are connected. Use the right arrows and notations to show the nature of relationships between classes, objects, or use cases.\n\n10. When to Use UML Diagrams\n• None When a system’s general structure needs to be represented, UML diagrams can help make it clearer how various parts work together, which facilitates idea sharing between stakeholders.\n• None When collecting and recording system requirements, UML diagrams, such as use case diagrams, can help you clearly grasp user demands by showing how users will interact with the system.\n• None If you’re involved in database design, class diagrams are great for illustrating the relationships among various data entities, ensuring your data model is well-organized.\n• None When working with team members or clients, UML diagrams act as a shared language that connects technical and non-technical stakeholders, improving overall understanding and alignment.\n\nAlthough Agile development and UML (Unified Modeling Language) are two distinct approaches to software development, they can work well together. This is how they are related:\n• Visual Communication : System behavior and design are demonstrated with the help of UML diagrams. Agile emphasizes the need of clear communication, and these diagrams help all parties involved—team members, stakeholders, and even non-technical individuals—understand what is happening.\n• Capturing User Stories : Use case diagrams in UML can help capture user stories, showing how users will interact with the system. This helps everyone understand the user’s perspective better.\n• Building in Steps : Agile development is all about working in small steps, and UML can adapt to this by allowing models to be created and updated as the project evolves.\n• Simplifying Requirements : Techniques like user story mapping can go hand-in-hand with UML, making it easier to visualize what needs to be done without overwhelming documentation.\n• Smart Modeling : Use UML as much as needed to help with communication, focusing on delivering useful software rather than getting bogged down in paperwork.\n• Empowering the Team : Give the team the freedom to decide how much modeling is necessary. They should feel comfortable using UML without feeling pressured to create too many diagrams\n\nBelow are the common challenges in UML Modeling:\n• None Accurately representing complex system requirements can be difficult, leading to either oversimplification or overwhelming detail.\n• None Team members may interpret the model differently, resulting in inconsistencies and misunderstandings about its purpose.\n• None Keeping UML diagrams current as the system evolves can be time-consuming, risking outdated representations if not managed effectively.\n• None Agile promotes teamwork, but sometimes UML diagrams are complicated and only a few people understand them. It can be hard to make sure everyone can contribute to and use the diagrams effectively.\n\nBelow are the benefits of using UML Diagrams:\n• None Developers and stakeholders may communicate using a single visual language thanks to UML’s standardized approach to system model representation.\n• None Developers, designers, testers, and business users are just a few of the stakeholders with whom UML diagrams may effectively communicate.\n• None UML diagrams make it easier to see the linkages, processes, and parts of a system.\n• None One useful tool for documentation is a UML diagram. They offer an ordered and systematic method for recording a system’s behavior, architecture, and design, among other elements."

The process of physically mapping out components makes it clearer what’s working, what’s not, and where there are opportunities for improvement. And using a common language, like UML diagrams, helps teams collaborate on these issues.\n\nThis guide will introduce you to the Unified Modeling Language and the diagrams that represent it. In no time, you and your team can utilize UML diagrams for your projects.\n\nThis guide is useful for:\n• System architects, software engineers, and software developers looking for an introduction to UML diagrams, and\n• People wanting to brush up on the fundamentals of UML and updates to UML 2.5.\n\nModeling is a way to visualize your software application design and check it against requirements before your team starts to code. In the same way that an architect creates a blueprint before starting construction on a skyscraper, a developer can use modeling diagrams to solidify and test what they are going to create before they start coding.\n\nMapping out a plan is the first step to any project, and modeling is an essential part of any software project, small or large. For an application to function well, it must be architected to enable scalability, security, and execution.\n\nUsing Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams, you can visualize and verify the designs of your software systems before code implementation makes changes difficult and expensive to execute.\n\nWhat is the UML?\n\nAccording to the Scope of the latest version of UML 2.5’s specification documentation, “the objective of UML is to provide system architects, software engineers, and software developers with tools for analysis, design, and implementation of software-based systems as well as for modeling business and similar processes.”\n\nUML itself is not a programming language, though there are tools that can generate code using UML diagrams. UML is a modeling language for designing systems. It was created by combining several object-oriented notations—Object-Oriented Design (i.e., Booch), Object Modeling Technique (OMT), and Object-Oriented Software Engineering (OOSE)—making it a natural fit for object-oriented languages and environments like C++, Java, and C#; however, you can also use it to model non-OO applications in languages like Fortran, VB, or COBOL.\n\nBecause UML establishes a standard semantic and syntactic structure, you can use it to model almost any type of application, regardless of your hardware, operating system, programming language, or network. UML allows you to specify, visualize, and document models of software systems both structurally and behaviorally before coding.\n\nUML was developed by Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson, and James Rumbaugh (aka ‘The Three Amigos’) in the mid-90s. The initial versions of UML were created by integrating three of the leading object-oriented methods—namely, Booch, OMT, and OOSE—developed by UML’s founders, respectively. They also incorporated best practices from modeling language design, object-oriented programming, and architectural description languages. Their efforts led to the release of UML 0.9 and 0.91.\n\nIn 1996, The Three Amigos led a consortium called the UML Partners to complete the UML specification. The partnership included several important individuals and organizations, including HP, DEC, IBM, and Microsoft. The resulting UML 1.1 was proposed to the Object Management Group (OMG) for standardization and adopted in November 1997. OMG has managed the language ever since.\n\nWith the help of an even larger consortium, UML 2.0 was introduced in 2005 and published as an approved standard by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). After the release of several more versions, the current version, UML 2.5, was released in October 2012 as an “In process” version that was officially released in June 2015.\n\nYou can download the complete UML 2.5 document here.\n\nModeling your software before you build it provides a number of benefits to teams. For one, it helps establish a logical order of a team’s activities. Knowing what artifacts need to be developed helps define the tasks that teams will need to complete. Modeling also helps your team establish criteria for monitoring and measuring a project’s products and activities.\n\nWhile some people might worry that using UML diagrams could lock them into a waterfall style of software development, that isn’t necessarily true. UML diagrams can be created and used at various stages of development, and they can be continuously updated and iterated.\n• Reducing redundancies. Diagrams make it easier for programmers to see redundant code and reuse portions of code that already exist rather than rewriting those functions.\n• Simplifying changes. Making changes to diagrams at the start is much easier than reprogramming code later. This will save your team valuable time and money.\n• Clarifying ambiguity. Design documentation can only go so far. In the long run, you’ll need it to communicate with new or faraway developers unfamiliar with your product’s history.\n\nUML is the most widely used and understood modeling language. UML is, by far, the most popular modeling language used today. That ubiquity is itself a benefit because most developers, regardless of their specialties or work history, will be familiar with at least some UML diagrams. And because they are meant to be understood by any type of programmer, they don’t require the ability to read a certain programming language to be useful.\n\nThree of the most popular UML diagrams will cover most of your modeling needs. Though there are 14 different types of UML diagrams for modeling applications, in practice, developers only use a few to document their software systems. The most common UML diagrams you’ll see and use are class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and use case diagrams. That means knowing how to create and read only 20% of this language will suffice for most of your projects.\n\nAs of UML 2.5, there are now fourteen officially recognized UML diagrams which are split into two main types:\n\n1. Structure diagrams show how the static parts of a system relate to each other. Each element represents a particular concept and may include abstract, real-world, and implementation factors.\n\n2. Behavior diagrams show the dynamic behavior of all objects in a system, including changes to the system over time. Interaction diagrams can be thought of as a subset of behavior diagrams.\n\nThere are seven structure diagrams in UML 2.5:\n• Class diagrams show the structure of a system as related classes and interfaces with their features, constraints, and relationships.\n• Component diagrams show components and the dependencies between them.\n• Composite structure diagrams show the internal structure of a classifier and the behavior of collaborations the structure makes possible.\n• Deployment diagrams show a system’s various hardware and the software deployed on it.\n• Object diagrams show a real-world example of a structure at a specific time.\n• Package diagrams show packages and the dependencies between those packages.\n\nThere are also seven behavior diagrams, the last four of which fall under the interaction diagram subset:\n• Activity diagrams show business or operational workflows of components in a system.\n• Use Case diagrams show how functionalities relate under particular actors.\n• State machine diagrams show the states and state transitions of a system.\n• Communication diagrams* show the interactions between objects in terms of sequenced messages.\n• Interaction overview diagrams* show an overview of the flow of control, with nodes representing interactions or interactions’ uses.\n• Sequence diagrams* show how objects communicate and the sequence of their messages.\n• Timing diagrams* show the timing constraints of a system in a given time frame.\n\nBefore you get started, it will be helpful to know some terms that will be used throughout this guide.\n• Abstract Class – A class that will never be instantiated nor will ever exist.\n• Abstract syntax compliance – Users can move models across different tools, even if they use different notations\n• Activity – A step or action within an activity diagram that represents an action by the system or by an Actor.\n• Activity Diagram – A flowchart that shows the process and its correlating decisions, including an algorithm or a business process.\n• Actor – An object or person that initiates events in the system.\n• Artifacts – Documents that describe the output of a step in the design process.

In a State Diagram, represents a change from one State to another.\n• Transition Phase – The last phase of the Rational Unified Process during which users are trained on using the new system and the system is made available to users.\n• UML – Unified Modeling Language utilizes text and graphic documents to enhance the analysis and design of software projects by allowing more cohesive relationships between objects.\n• UML 1 – First version of the Unified Modeling Language\n• Unified Modeling Language (UML) – A visual language for specifying, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of systems\n• Use Case – In a Use Case Diagram, represents an action that the system takes in response to some request from an Actor.\n• Use Case Diagram – A diagram that shows relations between Actors and Use Cases.\n• Visibility – A modifier to an Attribute or Operation that indicates what code has access to the member. Visibility levels include Public, Protected, and Private.\n• Workflow – A set of activities that produces some specific result.\n• XMI -An XML-based specification of the corresponding model interchange format\n\nAs we mentioned in the previous section, though there are 14 different types of UML diagrams, developers typically use just a few to cover most of their modeling needs. In this section, we’ll discuss how to create activity diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and use case diagrams.\n\nTemplates and shapes for these and more UML diagram types are available in Cacoo.\n\nAn activity diagram is exactly what it sounds like — a diagram that creates a visual depiction of an activity. The activity diagram itself can hold any amount of information detailing a wide variety of actions. If you can think of a workflow, you can diagram it out.\n\nUsing words and symbols, you can map out workflows to include the order in which tasks and operations need to be done, who needs to do them, what tasks can only be done once others are completed, which tasks are free-standing, and more.\n\nActions are tasks performed by a user, the system, or both in collaboration.\n\nNodes indicate the start or end of an activity. They can also indicate a fork or merge.\n\nHow to create an Activity Diagram in Cacoo:\n• In the Cacoo editor, go to Templates and select the Activity Diagram template.\n• Use round-edged rectangles to represent each action.\n• Use lines to demonstrate the flow of actions from one to another.\n• Use a circle to indicate the end of an activity.\n• Optionally, arrange actions into swimlanes corresponding to different objects or business roles that perform the actions.\n\nClass diagrams are a subsection of Structural UML diagrams and function as the most basic building tool to create applications.\n\nIt is most widely used to depict OOP content, more efficient app design and analysis, and as the base for the deployment and component diagram.\n\nClasses represent data or object types. They are visualized using a rectangular shape with the class name as the top section.\n\nAttributes are the named values that every instance of a type can have. They are listed under the class name.\n\nMethods are the functions that instances of a type can perform. They are listed below attributes.\n\nHow to create a Class Diagram in Cacoo:\n• In the Cacoo editor, go to templates and select the Class Diagram template.\n• Add new class shapes as necessary to fit your data.\n• Use lines to draw any associations, inheritances, or dependencies between types. Your notation style will determine the styling of these lines.\n\nThe difference between a sequence diagram and other types is that the sequence diagram depicts the actions in more detail. You can easily see how they are implemented, by whom, in what order, what needs to be completed beforehand, and what can be done after.\n\nAt a higher level, a sequence diagram can show how the process moves forward over time, including the order of actions. It, therefore, also shows the interaction between multiple actions, the passage of time, and the completion of past tasks, which moves the process forward.\n\nClasses represent data or object types. They are visualized using a rectangular shape.\n\nLifelines are vertical lines that represent the sequence of events that occur to a participant as time progresses. This participant can be an instance of a class, component, or actor.\n\nMessages are represented by lines between objects.\n\nHow to create a Sequence Diagram in Cacoo:\n• In the Cacoo editor, go to Templates and select the Sequence Diagram template.\n• Use rectangular boxes to indicate class instance names, class names, or objects.\n• Use vertical lifelines to show sequences of messages in chronological order and horizontal elements to show object instances as messages are relayed.\n• Draw lines to represent the sender and receiver of messages. Use solid arrowheads to symbolize synchronous messages, open arrowheads for asynchronous messages, and dashed lines for callback messages.\n\nUse case diagrams help communicate what the end result of an underdeveloped application will be. They’re extremely useful in meeting with a client and creating the idea of the functions, letting the developers work backward from there. Since this diagram focuses mainly on functionality and end results, it shows much more of WHAT the app will do without very much explanation of HOW the app will perform these individual functions.\n\nActors represent users, organizations, or external systems that interact with your application or system. An actor is a kind of type.\n\nUse Cases represent the actions performed by one or more actors in the pursuit of a particular goal. A use case is a kind of type.\n\nAssociations indicate where an actor takes part in a use case.\n\nHow to create a Use Case Diagram in Cacoo:\n• In the Cacoo editor, go to Templates and select the Use Case Diagram template.\n• Label your actors with stick figures (available under Stencils > Software > UML) or other relevant illustrations.\n• Use ovals to label your use cases.\n• Use lines to model the relationships between actors and use cases.\n\nExample UML use cases by industry\n\nAt this point, you might be asking when the need for UML diagrams comes up in real life. Well, here are a few examples of where you might see teams use UML diagrams from various industries.\n• Industry: Finance\n• Description: A leading bank used UML diagrams to model their core banking system. Class diagrams were used to define customer, account, and transaction entities, while sequence diagrams illustrated the workflow of a transaction processing system, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and internal policies.\n• Industry: Healthcare\n• None Description: A hospital used UML diagrams to design a hospital management system. Use case diagrams identified interactions between patients, doctors, and administrative staff. Activity diagrams were employed to map out patient admission and discharge processes, improving efficiency and coordination among departments.\n• Industry: E-commerce\n• None Description: An e-commerce company leveraged UML diagrams to develop an online shopping platform. Class diagrams defined product categories, customer profiles, and order management. Sequence diagrams detailed the shopping cart process, from product selection to checkout, enhancing the user experience and backend processing efficiency.\n\nIt’s not enough to understand how to build UML diagrams. You also have to know how they can fit into your existing workflows. Here are a few ways you might incorporate UML diagrams into common practices in your development team like Agile, Scrum, and DevOps.\n• Agile\n• Iterative Development: Create and refine UML diagrams iteratively throughout the Agile sprints.\n• User Stories: Use use case diagrams to visualize user stories and their interactions with the system.\n• Daily Stand-ups: Discuss updates to diagrams during stand-up meetings to ensure everyone is on the same page.\n• Scrum\n• Sprint Planning: Use activity diagrams to outline the tasks and workflows for each sprint.\n• Retrospectives: Review UML diagrams during retrospectives to identify improvements and document changes.\n• Product Backlog: Maintain updated UML diagrams in the product backlog for clear requirements and design understanding.\n• DevOps\n• Automation: Generate UML diagrams from code using plugins and ensure they are accurate reflections of the system.\n• Collaboration: Share UML diagrams in shared repositories accessible by both development and operations teams.\n\nYou will also likely want to integrate your UML diagrams and workflows into your other tools. Especially your version control system and project management software.\n\nLet’s say your team is using Git for version control. You might use UML diagrams for:\n• Documentation in Repositories: Store UML diagrams in repositories alongside your code. Use tools that support UML format files to keep them version-controlled.\n• Branching: Collaborators can create branches for different features, updating UML diagrams as the design evolves. Use pull requests for diagram review and approval.\n\nLet’s say your team is using Backlog as their project management tool (which includes built-in Git repositories for every project.) You might use UML diagrams to:\n• Task Management: Link UML diagrams to relevant tasks or issues in Backlog. This helps track which parts of the diagram correspond to specific development items.\n• Annotations and Comments: Use Cacoo’s comment feature to provide feedback directly on UML diagrams, facilitating discussion and iteration. Use issue comments to share updates and request feedback.\n\nAnother consideration when implementing UML diagrams is quality. Creating a formal review process will ensure that your diagrams are as helpful as possible.\n\nEnsure you’re checking each of the following for every UML diagram.\n• Clarity: Ensure diagrams are clear, with no overlapping lines or ambiguous elements.\n• Completeness: Check that all necessary components are represented and that relationships are correctly defined.\n\nThis is a simple example of a review workflow you can use to create your own.\n• Initial creation: Diagrams are created by a designer and shared with the team.\n• Peer review: Team members review the diagrams, focusing on potential issues and suggesting improvements.\n• Feedback loop: The designer incorporates feedback and iterates on the diagram.\n• Approval: Once refined, the diagram is formally approved and integrated into project documentation.\n\nObject-oriented conceptualizing is simply the idea of taking objects that exist in the real world and turning them into flows and processes within your UML diagram. Developers do this daily to break difficult concepts or problems into solvable issues within their diagrams as they build applications.\n\nRelationships within a UML diagram may seem somewhat self-explanatory, but they can be a bit much to wrap your head around at first. The relationships within your diagrams connect two concepts or actors. Each line you draw in your diagram represents a relationship you are creating.\n• Association – The general term encompassing all types of relationships\n• Directed association – A relationship flowing in a specific direction, annotated with an arrow\n• Reflexive association – A relationship where a class has more than one function\n• Multiplicity – When the cardinality of the class is depicted in the relationship\n• Aggregation – When a class is built due to the formation or grouping of another class, i.e. from ‘wolf’ to ‘pack’\n• Composition – Similarly to Aggregation, a new class is formed depending on a previous class\n• Realization – Relationship depicting the inter-functionality between two classes\n\nWhile creating UML diagrams from scratch is easy with Cacoo, using templates can greatly speed up your diagramming process.\n\nIn Cacoo, you can choose from many different types of UML diagram templates. Simply open the editor, choose a template to get you started, and begin customizing it to your flow.\n\nIf you create a diagram you think you’ll want to replicate, save it as a new template. With custom templates and shapes, you can recreate your best work again and again.\n\nCacoo offers a set of UML symbols, so you don’t have to worry about creating them all anew. This will not only save you time but will also give your diagram a look of consistency as well as prevent it from looking too cluttered.\n\nDespite being templated out, the symbols’ actual form and size can be easily edited, stretched, rotated, etc., to suit your specific needs.\n\nNeed another source to easily remember, track, or look up some information on UML diagrams or what symbols to use when? Check out these handy links for extra resources:\n• Books:\n• “UML Distilled: A Brief Guide to the Standard Object Modeling Language” by Martin Fowler.\n• Articles:\n• Explore articles on sites like InfoQ, IEEE, and ACM Digital Library.\n\nWhen sharing your diagrams with others, you want to make sure they’re easy to understand, clean, and follow consistent rules. These factors won’t change your actual model, but they will greatly improve your ability to communicate your system and goals to your team.\n\nReadability is important for understanding. When viewing your diagram, all text should be large enough to be legible. If the text can only be read when zoomed in, your diagram has too much information or is too complicated.\n\nAlso, don’t try to get too fancy with fonts. Generally, you can stick to one font type. If you feel confident in your typography skills, you can venture into two or even three but never add fonts just for the sake of looks. If your designs aren’t adding to the readability of your diagram, they’re taking away from it.\n\nColors can be a great way to show differentiation in your diagram. It can increase readability and make your diagrams look more professional. However, when taken too far, color can distract your reader from the information at hand or even confuse the reader if not applied uniformly. When using color, think sparingly. Try to stick to the least number of colors necessary to bring clarity to your diagram. It can also be useful to provide a key or legend for colors.\n\nLess information is more useful\n\nDiagrams should focus on just a few key elements with a limited perspective. If you try to include too many elements in your diagrams, they can quickly grow so large and complex that they become too difficult for anyone to actually read.\n\nLarge diagrams don’t convey more information; they create more confusion. For complex systems, split the information up into smaller, more easily digestible diagrams.\n\nWhen thinking about how much information to include or exclude, imagine what your diagram would look like printed out on a standard sheet of paper. If it would be too difficult to read, scale back and try again.\n\nYou also don’t have to name every attribute, association, or constraint contained within a diagram. Only display items that are relevant to the current perspective of the diagram. That information can be elaborated on within a separate diagram.\n\nNo two lines in your diagram should cross. This is important not only for clarity but to ensure that your system does not contain a design flaw.\n\nIf you are unable to uncross two or more lines on your diagram, you either have:\n• Too much information in one diagram. Maybe you’re trying to combine two different perspectives, or you’re just trying to go too in-depth for a single diagram. Remember, less information is often more useful.\n• A design flaw in your model. The worst-case scenario is that your system contains a design flaw, but it’s better to figure that out now than later. All working systems can be displayed without crossing lines. If you’re finding it a challenge to visualize your system, try figuring out if there’s an element you’ve overlooked.\n\nAll lines in your diagrams should run either horizontally or vertically. All angles should be right angles. Straightening out your lines will instantly add clarity to your diagrams.\n\nThe only exception to this rule is use cases, which sometimes use angled lines to represent relations.\n\nWhen drawing hierarchies on a diagram, always place parent elements higher than child elements so that arrows will always point upwards.\n\nMost follow this rule without even learning it, but every once in a while, someone tries to flip their hierarchies upside down. For consistency’s sake, always put parents first. Your readers shouldn’t have to orient themselves to new rules to understand your flow.\n\nIf you have multiple elements descending from the same parent, use a vertical tree style to demonstrate your hierarchy.\n\nConsistency extends beyond fonts and colors. When you’re done with your diagram, run a quick check to make sure you’ve treated every element equally.\n• Always double-check to make sure your elements are aligned, either by one side or by their centers.\n• Make sure elements of the same type are the same size when possible.\n\nUML diagrams are only as useful as they are readable. If your audience doesn’t understand them, you’ve wasted everyone’s time. Following these rules will ensure that you’re delivering organized, clean diagrams that any team member can pick up and understand.\n\nAs you become well-versed in UML, you may want to explore more advanced methods and applications. Here are a few to keep in mind.\n• Model-Driven Development (MDD): Model-Driven Development involves using UML models to automatically generate code. This ensures consistency between design and implementation and reduces manual coding errors.\n• Custom Stereotypes and Profiles: Extend UML by creating custom stereotypes and profiles to match your specific domain requirements. This customization allows you to tailor UML diagrams to represent special-purpose modeling concepts.\n• Validation and Verification: Implement validation and verification techniques to ensure UML diagrams accurately represent system requirements. Use tools that check for consistency, completeness, and correctness of diagrams against project specifications.\n\nCacoo is simple to use, easy to learn, and built with collaboration in mind.\n\nUsing our cloud-based editor, your team can collaborate on diagrams in real time.
