To avoid name conflicts the component is named Data Grid Pro for the full-featured enterprise grid, and Data Grid for the free community version. Rows are key-value pair objects, mapping column names as keys with their values. You should also provide an property on each row to allow delta updates and better performance. Comparable to rows, columns are objects defined with a set of attributes of the interface. They are mapped to the rows through their property. You can import to see all column properties.

The Data Grid component is built with React and TypeScript to provide a smooth UX for manipulating an unlimited set of data. It features an intuitive API for real-time updates as well as theming and custom templates—all with blazing-fast performance.\n\nThe Data Grid presents information in a structured format of rows and columns. The data is displayed in a user-friendly interface for efficient editing, reviewing, and analysis. Visit the installation guide to learn how to install the correct package version and dependencies. The component comes in three different versions, one available under MIT license and two available under commercial license. The MIT-licensed version (also referred to as the \"Community version\") is a stronger alternative to plain data tables. It's a clean abstraction with basic features like editing, pagination, column grouping, and single-column sorting and filtering.\n\nThe commercially licensed versions are available in two plans: Pro and Premium. The Pro plan extends the features available in the Community version to support more complex use cases. It adds features like advanced filtering, column pinning, column and row reordering, support for tree data, and virtualization to handle bigger datasets. The demo below displays 31 columns and 100,000 rows—over 3 million cells in total.\n\nThe Premium plan includes everything from Pro, as well as advanced features for data analysis and large dataset management, like row grouping with aggregation functions (such as sum and average) and the ability to export to Excel files. Visit the showcase page for a comprehensive overview of all features exclusive to this plan. The demo below groups rows by commodity name, and uses an aggregation function to calculate the sum of quantities for each group and in total (displayed in a summary row). You can experiment with grouping other columns in the columns' header menus. And since you're here, try exporting to Excel and copying and pasting data from-to Excel tables."

My requirement is also gather with Typescript and Material UI version 5.0.\n\nSo I used their latest Material data grid free release(version 6). When we plan to use v6 data grid, It is bit different than version 5. So I like to show how I fulfill my requirements and how I made my components in a better way.\n\nFirst we need to have latest react version and Material UI version up to 5. Then in here I’m planning to work on Material UI x-data-grid version 6.\n\nIn here I’m using Typescript to show the coding examples.\n\nOk, Let’s create our shared data grid components like below. I will explain about some properties I have used inside this data grid Material UI component.\n\nThis is my basic setup of data grid component.\n\nOk, So this is our basic shared component. I have disabled Column filtering and Column menu options with print page option and CSV download options for simplicity. You can enable those things if you need.\n\nIn here we use slot props to enable toolbar inside the table header. It includes print page, CSV option etc…\n\nFor more details about pagination, you can refer Material UI official documentation page.\n\nFor use this shared component we can make our main component like below.\n\nFor now our basic shared data table component and the main component is completed.\n\nIn here we defined unique row id as my result array id and also pass initial values as my dummy result array.\n\nThink, sometimes you need to reset the page and the page size. As an example If we need to reset the start page number and the page size when doing a custom search, how can we achieve that.\n\nSo for that data grid have a prop called as apiRef.\n\nWe can use that prop to change the page size and other related things. This apiRef should be defined inside the data grid component. I just used a trigger value to re-render my component.\n\nFor more details about apiRef you can refer their official document page.\n\nYou can do much more customization with their data grid pro versions. In this article I used only their free version.\n\nI know this is not looks like a complex part. But I had some issues when I was creating this data grid. So I think this will helpful for someone.\n\nThank you. Enjoy the content.\n\nThank you for reading until the end.

        "document": "You can make a column editable by enabling the property in its column definition. This lets the user edit any cell from the specified columns. For example, with the code snippet below, users can edit cells in the column, but not in the column. The following demo shows an example of how to make all columns editable. Play with it by double-clicking or pressing on any cell.\n\nBy default, only one cell can be editable at a time. But you can let your user edit all cells in a row simultaneously. To enable this behavior, set the prop on the Data Grid to . Note that you still need to set the property in each column definition to specify which of them are editable; the same basic rules for cell editing also apply to row editing. The following demo illustrates how row editing works. The user can start and stop editing a row using the same actions as those provided for cell editing (for example double-clicking a cell).\n\nBy design, when changing the value of a cell all callbacks from other columns are also called. This lets you apply conditional validation where the value of a cell impacts the validation status of another cell in the same row. If you only want to run validation when the value has changed, check if the param is . For more details on how to use , please check the editing validation section. Each cell and row has two modes: and . When in mode, users can directly change the content of a cell or a row. When a cell is in mode, users can start editing a cell (or row if ) with any of the following actions:\n• None Pressing , or —note that the latter two options both delete any existing content\n• None Pressing any printable key, such as , , , or\n• None Calling passing the row ID and column field of the cell to be edited\n• None Calling passing the ID of the row (only available if ). You can also enter edit mode with a single click by following this recipe. When a cell is in mode, the user can stop editing with any of the following interactions:\n• None Pressing —this also reverts any changes made\n• None Pressing —this also saves any changes made\n• None Pressing —this also saves any changes made and moves the focus to the next cell in the same column\n• None Clicking outside the cell or row—this also saves any changes made\n• None Calling passing the row ID and column field of the cell that's been edited\n• None Calling passing the ID of the row (only possible if ). The interactions that start and stop trigger and events, respectively. For row editing, the events are and . You can control how these events are handled to customize editing behavior. For convenience, you can also listen to these events using their respective props: These events and props are called with an object containing the row ID and column field of the cell that is being edited. The object also contains a param that specifies which type of interaction caused the event to be fired—for instance, when a double-click initiates edit mode. The following demo shows how to prevent the user from exiting edit mode when clicking outside of a cell. To do this, the prop is used to check if the is . If that condition is true, it disables the default event behavior. In this context, the user can only stop editing a cell by pressing , or .\n\nWhen the user performs an action to stop editing, the callback is triggered. Use it to send the new values to the server and save them into a database or other storage method. The callback is called with three arguments:\n• The updated row with the new values returned by the .\n• The original values of the row before editing.\n• An object with additional properties such as . Please note that the must return the row object to update the Data Grid internal state. The value returned is used later as an argument on a call to . If you want to delete a row from the internal state of the Data Grid, you can return an additional property in the row object from the callback. This will remove the row from the internal state of the Data Grid. It is a more performant way to delete a row as compared to updating the prop or using API method because uses the under the hood which doesn't cause a full regeneration of the row tree. In the example above, is a function that determines whether a row should be deleted based on the updated row data. If returns , the row will be deleted from the Data Grid's internal state. If you need to cancel the save process on —for instance, when a database validation fails, or the user wants to reject the changes—there are two options:\n• Reject the promise so that the internal state is not updated and the cell remains in edit mode.\n• Resolve the promise with the second argument (original row before editing), so that the internal state is not updated, and the cell exits edit mode. The following demo implements the first option: rejecting the promise. Instead of validating while typing, it simulates validation on the server. If the new name is empty, the promise responsible for saving the row will be rejected, and the cell will remain in edit mode. The demo also shows that can pre-process the row model that will be saved into the internal state. Additionally, is called to display the error message. To exit edit mode, press or enter a valid name.\n\nThe second option—resolving the promise with the second argument—lets the user cancel the save process by rejecting the changes and exiting the edit mode. In this case, is resolved with the original value(s) of the row. The following demo shows how this approach can be used to ask for confirmation before sending the data to the server. If the user accepts the change, the internal state is updated with the values. But if the changes are rejected, the internal state remains unchanged, and the cell is reverted back to its original value. The demo also employs validation to prevent entering an empty name.\n\nValue parser and value setter You can use the property in the column definition to modify the value entered by the user—for example, to convert the value to a different format: You can use the property of the column definition to customize how the row is updated with a new value. This lets you insert a value from a nested object. It is called with an object containing the new cell value to be saved as well as the row that the cell belongs to. If you are already using a to extract the value from a nested object, then the will probably also be necessary. In the following demo, both the and the are defined for the Full name column. The capitalizes the value entered, and the splits the value and saves it correctly into the row model:\n\nIf the column definition sets a callback for the property, then it will be called each time a new value is entered into a cell from this column. This property lets you pre-process the props that are passed to the edit component. The callback is called with an object containing the following attributes:\n• : the row model containing the value(s) of the cell or row before entering edit mode\n• : the props, containing the value after the value parser, that are passed to the edit component\n• : determines if is different from the last time this callback was called Data validation is one type of pre-processing that can be done in this way. To validate the data entered, pass a callback to checking if is valid. If the new value is invalid, set to a truthy value and return the modified props, as shown in the example below. When the user tries to save the updated value, the change will be rejected if the error attribute is truthy (invalid). Changing inside the callback has no effect. To pre-process it, use a value parser. The demo below contains an example of server-side data validation. In this case, the callback returns a promise that resolves to the modified props. Note that the value passed to is passed directly to the edit component as the prop. While the promise is not resolved, the edit component will receive an prop with value equal to .\n\nYou can control the active mode using the props and (only works if ). The prop accepts an object containing the (and additional options) for a given column field, in a given row, as in the following example. The options accepted are the same available in and . For row editing, the props work in a similar manner. The options accepted are the same available in and . Additionally, the callback props and (only works if ) are available. Use them to update the respective prop. In the demo below, is used to control the mode of selected cell using the external buttons. For an example using row editing check the full-featured CRUD component.\n\nThe options passed to both model props only take effect when changes. Updating the params of a cell or row, but keeping the same , makes the cell or row to stay in the same mode. Also, removing one field or row ID from the object will not cause the missing cell or row to go to mode. Each of the built-in column types provides a component to edit the value of the cells. To customize column types, or override the existing components, you can provide a new edit component through the property in the column definition. This property works like the property, with the difference that it is rendered while cells are in edit mode. The property receives all params from , which extends . Additionally, the props added during pre-processing are also available in the params. These are the most important params to consider:\n• : contains the current value of the cell in edit mode, overriding the value from\n• : whether is being executed or not Once a new value is entered into the input, it must be sent to the Data Grid. To do this, pass the row ID, the column field, and the new cell value to a call to . The new value will be parsed and validated, and the prop will reflect the changes in the next render. It's important to also handle the accessibility of custom edit components. When a cell enters edit mode, an element must be focused to provide access via keyboard and for screen readers. Since multiple cells may be in edit mode at the same time, the prop will be on the cell that should have focus. Use this prop to focus the appropriate element. props GridRenderEditCellParams id value field hasFocus props apiRef ref React React hasFocus ref current hasFocus event React ChangeEvent HTMLInputElement newValue event target value apiRef current id field value newValue The following demo implements a custom edit component, based on the component from , for the Rating column.\n\nBy default, each call to triggers a new render. If the edit component requires the user to type a new value, re-rendering the Data Grid too often will drastically reduce performance. One way to avoid this is to debounce the API calls. You can use to handle debouncing by setting the param to a positive integer that defines a set time period in milliseconds. No matter how many times the API method is called, the Data Grid will only be re-rendered after that period of time has passed. When the Data Grid is only set to re-render after a given period of time has passed, the prop will not be updated on each call. To avoid a frozen UI, the edit component can keep the current value in an internal state and sync it once changes. Modify the edit component to enable this feature: const newValue = event.target.value; // The new value entered by the user An edit component has \"auto-stop\" behavior when it stops edit mode as soon as the value is changed. To picture better, imagine an edit component with a combo, created following the normal steps. By default, it would require two clicks to change the value of the cell: one click inside the cell to select a new value, and another click outside the cell to save. This second click can be avoided if the first click also stops the edit mode. To create an edit component with auto-stop, call after setting the new value. Since may do additional processing, you must wait for it to resolve before stopping the edit mode. Also, it is a good practice to check if has returned . It will be if set an error during validation. The following demo implements an edit component with auto-stop, based on a native component for the Role column."

        "document": "In this article, we'll show how to use Material UI component and Refine's hook to render data from a mock API server in tabular form using a Refine application.\n\nRefine is a React-based framework for rapidly developing data-driven applications through a collection of helper , , and with out-of-box support packages. Additionally, it provides a clean interface for integrating with popular UI frameworks such as Material UI, Ant Design, Mantine, and Chakra UI.\n\nMaterial UI is a React UI component library with a rich set of components and tools for bootstrapping elegant user interfaces. We'll use the component to render a list of employees from a mock server. We'll also look at some of the properties and custom configurations that can be used with the component.\n• Creating mock API with Mockaroo and My JSON Server\n• Pagination, Filtering, and Sorting using the hook\n\nTo follow along with this tutorial, we assume you have the following:\n• A code editor of your choice (VSCode, Sublime Text, etc.)\n\nIf you don't familiar with Refine, we recommend you to check out the Refine tutorial to get started.\n\nWe'll use the command to interactively initialize the project.\n\nSelect the following options when prompted:\n\nOnce the setup is complete, navigate to the project folder and start your app with:\n\nAfter the app has started, you should see the following page:\n\nThe fake employee data we're going to render in the component will be created with Mockaroo and My JSON Server.\n\nMockaroo is a random fake data generator for generating up to 1,000 realistic test data in JSON, CSV, and other formats.\n\nMy JSON Server is a fake online REST Server for prototyping application APIs without a backend. The REST Server for the JSON data we'll use in this tutorial is hosted here, and the fake JSON data created with Mockaroo is on GitHub.\n\nThe Material UI DataGrid component is an extendable and feature-rich component used to display tabular data in React applications. Some of its powerful features include automatic pagination, table data filtering and sorting, and many other cool features.\n\nThe component is available in two versions, the MIT and Commercial (Pro and Premium) versions. The MIT version is free-to-use while the commercial version is paid and extends the features of the MIT version such as the ability to filter and sort multiple columns at the same time.\n\nThe component requires two mandatory properties namely: and . The prop accepts an array of fields which are used as the table header while the prop accepts an array of objects (data) to be rendered within the table rows.\n\nThe following example shows a basic usage of the component:\n\nAlthough Refine is a headless framework that can be used with any UI framework of choice. This means that we can use the component in our Refine application without having to worry about integrating it with the framework.\n\nWe'll see how to leverage these components with Refine's hook in our Refine app in the coming sections.\n\nWe'll use to style our app, as Refine doesn't control how we choose to style our applications. So let's go ahead and install it with its types definition as follows:\n\nNext, create folder under the . This is where we'll create our page components.\n\nThen, create component in the folder with the following code:\n\nIn the above code, we're creating a styled div to wrap our app content through the prop and then aligning it in the center of the page.\n\nIn addition to integrating Material UI components, Refine provides a clean interface through the hook for implementing some properties that can be used with MUI X component. The hook simplifies working with features such as pagination, sorting, and filtering which come as out-of-box.\n\nFor instance, if you have a page component where you want to render tabular data, you might do something like the below:\n\nIt's important to note that in the above example, we're not passing the prop to the component. This is because the variable automatically injects the values into the component through the native component's prop available in the file of your Refine application.\n\nThe prop is used to read data from an API endpoint and then make the data available in the entire application.\n\nWe'll use the mock API we created with Mockaroo and My JSON Server as the data source for our component.\n\nTo get started, create a file named in the folder and add the following code:\n\nLet's understand what's going on the above code:\n\nThe variable defines the column fields for our data. We also wrapped the fields in a higher order component for memoizing the values and then created fields for each of the properties from our resource endpoint. We also used the attribute to compose a value from two different fields.\n\nNext, replace the file with the following code:\n\nHere's a breakdown of what is going on in the code:\n\nThe component accepts a prop which specifies the source of our data (the fake REST API we created earlier), and a prop which takes an array of object properties:\n• The property is the name of the resource we are expecting from the REST API - this value must match the resource we created in the REST API. In our case, .\n• The property takes a string value which is the path to render the component. In our case, .\n\nYou can refer to the component documentation for more information on the available props.\n\nWith components, we defined the routes to render the component when the path is visited. Additionally, we used the component to redirect to the path when the path is visited.\n\nFinally, we used the component we created in the previous section to wrap the defined routes.\n\nNow, if you navigate to , you should see the following:\n\nVoila! We've successfully displayed our data from a REST API in a MUI X DataGrid component. In the next section we'll look at how we can use the hook to simplify operations such as pagination, sorting, and filtering.\n\nThe hook simplifies operations such as pagination, sorting, and filtering on the component through a flexible API. In this part, we'll leverage the hook to add pagination, sorting, and filter features to our employees table data.\n\nPagination lets us display a certain number of rows on a DataGrid at a time and is enabled by default. It cannot be disabled either. It is available at the bottom of the DataGrid component like so:\n\nFor example, our employees list has a total of 28 rows, but we may want to render just 5 rows per page. Here’s a demo showing how we can render 5 rows of items on the initial page render with the property (defaults to 25).\n\nThis is similar to using the prop on the DataGrid component. We can also define how many rows the user can choose to view per page using the prop.\n\nUpdate the with the following codes:\n\nWhich renders our grid like this:\n\nYou can refer to the MU X DataGrid documentation for more information on the pagination feature.\n\nThe DataGrid component lets us sort the data in the rows based on one criterion at a time. Sorting is enabled for all columns by default in the MIT version and can also be disabled either for all columns or a single column.\n\nWe can sort the rows in three orders: ascending (ASC), descending (DESC) or null (sorting will be disabled).\n\nTo sort the rows, click or hover on any column header, this displays an arrow indicator pointing up or down depending on your sorting order. When it's ascending the arrow points upward, and points downward for descending. Alternatively, we can also access it from the grid column menu.\n\nWe can initialize a sorting order for each or all fields in the grid using the property of the component. This lets us sort the rows on the initial page render.\n\nThe above example will sort the rows using the level column on the initial render in descending order like so:\n\nWe can also sort rows externally using the function from the hook. The following code shows how we can sort the rows by clicking on custom buttons outside the DataGrid component.\n\nHere's a GIF showing the result of the above example.\n\nYou can refer to MU X DataGrid documentation for more information on the sorting feature.\n\nFiltering lets us search the rows for values in the component based on one criterion at a time.\n\nWe can access the sort feature by either clicking on the filter item in the column menu:\n\nor by using the filter button in the grid toolbar:\n\nYou can import the component and use it like so:\n\nThe filter feature works by searching the rows for values that match a given filter operator. The list of operators which can be used in the sortModel can be found here.\n\nFor instance in our employees table we can filter the department column for rows that contain a value by using any of the above methods.\n\nHere's the code for the above example.
