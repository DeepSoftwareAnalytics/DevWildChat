        "document": "If you are having problems adding an NPC to the followers/marriage faction, the solution below should fix your problems. I'm just relaying this information because I figured it out after hours of messing around with the console. I'm going to go through the process step by step for anyone who does not know it. (In the post below, give me a second, don't post please.) \"It is good to have an end to journey towards; but it is the journey that matters in the end.\" - Ursula K. LeGuin\n\n1. Find the NPC you want to make a follower/marry. Open console with the tilde key. Click on the NPC. The NPC's ID will pop up when you click them, take note of the ID, you'll be using it later when you are setting relationship via console command. \n\n\n\nIf you want to marry the NPC type in: addfac 19809 1\n\nIf you want to make the NPC a follower type in: addfac 5C84D 1\n\n\n\n2. Inorder for the follow/marriage choice to appear, the NPC has to like you. To do this, you need to set the NPC's relationship level. To set the relationship between you and the follower correctly, you need to type in BOTH OF the following lines into the console. \n\n\n\nSetrelationshiprank \"NPC ID HERE\" 4 \n\nPlayer.setrelationshiprank \"NPC ID HERE\" 4\n\n\n\n3. For certain NPCs, the marriage/follow options will not appear until you reset the NPCs dialogue options, to do so, type the following lines into the console. \n\n\n\nDisable\n\nEnable \n\n\n\n4. If you just want to marry an NPC, you're done after the last step, the 4th step only pertains to people who are making NPCs followers. Inorder for some followers to fight enemies and instead of running around like idiots, you need to set their confidence level. To do this, open the console, click the NPC, and type the following lines into the console.\n\n\n\nsetav aggression 1\n\nsetav confidence 3\n\n\n\n5. The last step you have to do is set your follower to essential, inorder to do this you need to use the NPCs ID Number. To figure out the ID number you need to type the following into the console.\n\n\n\nHelp \"NPCs Name\" 4 \n\n\n\nThis will give you the ID, along with a lot of other random data about the NPC, take the code you find and type in the line below.\n\n\n\nsetessential \"The ID you found\" 1\n\n\n\n6. You might find your new follower weak, and that's because your new follower does not level with you. Chances are they are a very low level and will die very quickly to anything that attacks them. The easiest way to remedy this is to open the console, click your follower and type.\n\n\n\nsetlevel \"Insert level here\"\n\n\n\nAfter you complete step six, you're done. You now have your own essential NPC follower to do your bidding. Take note, if you do not set the NPC as essential, when they die, you may lose the NPC for good. Using resurrect on the NPC via the console will bring the NPC back to life, but the NPC will no longer follow you and may disappear from the game completely. So far, I haven't found a way around this, so setting the NPC to essential is a must. \"It is good to have an end to journey towards; but it is the journey that matters in the end.\" - Ursula K. LeGuin\n\nWell, that's about all, I can edit these posts more and add a few things if people want more specifics(such as how to set specific follower classes and how to increase follower levels), but I'm not typing all that stuff out right now. This is just meant to be a reference for people who are having problems adding NPCs to the follower/marriage faction. \"It is good to have an end to journey towards; but it is the journey that matters in the end.\" - Ursula K. LeGuin\n\nThere are still some points missing from your guide in regarding to adding NPC as companion I'm afraid.\n\n\n\nYou still need to set the NPC's aggression and behaviors for them to function properly in battle.\n\n\n\nsetav aggression 1\n\nsetav confidence 3\n\n\n\nThat should make your NPC more likely to engage in battle. \n\n\n\nHOWEVER, still, your NPC will probably not be the same level as you are and does get killed very easily. Either you have to set them as essential, or use resurrect command to bring him / her. Upon resurrection, you will realize that the NPC will NOT join you as companion anymore, and he / she may or may not accept the codes mentioned above to rejoin you as companion.\n\nsiuche posted...\n\nThere are still some points missing from your guide in regarding to adding NPC as companion I'm afraid.\n\n\n\nYou still need to set the NPC's aggression and behaviors for them to function properly in battle.\n\n\n\nsetav aggression 1\n\nsetav confidence 3\n\n\n\nThat should make your NPC more likely to engage in battle. \n\n\n\nHOWEVER, still, your NPC will probably not be the same level as you are and does get killed very easily.

There are actually console commands to level up your followers and their set specific skills/abilities, I just didn't add all that information because it would be really time consuming and tedious. Honestly, not looking for a sticky, I just wanted a rough version of these commands to be posted somewhere easily accessible. \"It is good to have an end to journey towards; but it is the journey that matters in the end.\" - Ursula K. LeGuin\n\nLord_Badmagic posted...\n\nGuess I still need to wait for the CS. :(\n\n\n\nOH! Sorry, I completely missed you post. Ok, so here is one way to get what you want. You wouldn't mess with aggression or confidence. What you'd do is you add your follower to the faction you don't want attacking them.\n\n\n\nIE: If you don't want Bandits/Warlocks/Draugs/Dremora attacking them, you'd click on THEM, and type:\n\n\n\nAddtofaction 000E0CD9 1 - Bandit Faction\n\nAddtofaction 000E0CDA 1 - Warlocks Faction\n\nAddtofaction 000E0CDB 1 - Draugs Faction\n\nAddtofaction 00043597 1 - Dremora Faction\n\n\n\nYou'd have to mess around with the faction codes, just type in the console...\n\n\n\nHelp faction 0... page up and you'll be able to see all the faction codes in the game. \n\n\n\nAdd the follower to the factions you don't want attacking them. As far as I know, there isn't an addallfactions console code, but there is a removeallfactions console code,(Don't fool around with removeallfactions. If you use it on merchants you lose the option to trade with them because you removed them from their faction). It might be tedious typing a majority of the factions in... but, if you did it, you'd get what you're looking for. If anyone has a better answer, feel free to post it. \n\n\n\nAlternatively:(I don't know if this one works, but if it does, you might be able to avoid typing in 30+ faction codes.) You could try fooling around with 'setclass' and mess around with the AI type of your follower. The AI type determines how your follower fights other people, like if you set it to farmer they'll run away, if you set it to nightingale, they'll be a badass. The setclass section is the one I didn't type up yet, but as far as I know, there isn't a class that doesn't attack, or doesn't get attacked. \"It is good to have an end to journey towards; but it is the journey that matters in the end.\" - Ursula K. LeGuin\n\nTeen Gohan posted...\n\n***spin for brevity***\n\n\n\nThanks for the suggestions, I'll have to try some tests, hopefully making someone like Lydia a member of the other factions wont force people like the vigilant of stendarr or city guards to attack them. If worst comes to worst I can wait for the CS but hopefully this will allow what I'm looking for, a page that knows to stay out of the way of my blade and carry my burdens. ;D"

        "document": "The following page is dedicated to creating custom followers via console commands, as well as a list of potential characters for the conversion.\n\nMost NPCs can be converted into followers if one has their factions and relationship rank altered, since their AI is tied to the factions they are. This allows you to convert character with special service (e.g. blacksmith, spellcasters, unique NPCs) into your followers. This can also be used to fix an NPC who should be a follower but is bugged.\n\nThe specific commands for this conversion are:\n• In the console, target the NPC question by clicking on them using the mouse.\n\nafter which, clicking on the NPC should give the \"Follow me\" dialog.\n\nAlternatively, you can create your own follower and spouse via Creation Kit if you have a matching character voice set with follower option.\n\nPC By placing character, alternating relationship rank and modifying factions via console commands, some Characters can be converted into followers by force.\n• Step 1: Searching for NPCs, can be town NPC or character with race as the names: Dealer, Hroki, Wood Elf, High Elf, etc. -\n• Step 2: Place the NPC at your desired location, it'll set as their homes:\n• Step 6: add to potential follower faction: (Player Ally Faction is required for some hostile characters, you may add Marriage Factions also)\n• Step 9: resurrect the NPC if they are killed due to the NPC being hostile before, by typing\n• Step 10: modify inventory by either using or recycling actor using\n• Step 11: ask them to be your follower\n• Sometimes the follower option might be gone after marriage or death under this condition.\n• Solution: use and command to resolve this problem.\n\nP.S. not guaranteed to work on all NPCs, it only works on NPC summoned via character model Base ID instead of radiant ID.\n\nTutorial of converting hostile NPC into follower (tested on Dealer):\n\n\n\n This only works on NPCs summoned via Base ID, but not Reference ID.\n\nCharacters IDs are identified via specified number and letter formation to distinguish between Character Model ID and Radiant ID, the following is an example:\n• Bandits are generated with radiant character Base ID or Ref ID, while their base ID can be uncovered in console commands by typing .\n• The first two number determines their character type (Bandit Rank), the third letter determines character type (D: class, D: design, E: encounter/radiant).\n• The fourth number determines the variant's race (e.g. 6 is always Bosmer) while the fifth one determines facial variants. e.g. 39D67 will always spawn bosmer female.\n• While radiant characters' fourth number can be letter as well, this avoids using the same Base ID so the AI won't be bugged.\n• All bandits models are generated within the same BaseIDs, therefore their facial features are not entirely generated randomly.\n• With the exception of TreasCorpseBanditWoodElfFemale, her Base ID does not follow this rule, although she can still be generated with radiant characters.\n\nThe following are recommended to convert into followers:\n• Characters with its race as its names – their AI and inventory can be toggled freely without suffering any consequences\n• Citizens – some provides services which are handy, especially merchants and blacksmiths.\n• Spellcasters – they provide decent ranged attack or conjured creatures to assist you, a notable example includes Alva.\n• Bandits – Unlike most enemies, they do provide follower service after conversion. This also include Champion of Boethiah.\n• Vampires – They also provide follower options as well, oddly, female vampires summoned via Vanilla Version Template Base ID often interact with other female NPCs nearby actively, except Alva.\n• Characters with \"EvenTone,\" \"Commoner,\" \"Sultry\" and \"YoungEager\" voice set can mostly be converted into followers.\n\nWhat not to convert\n\nThe following are not recommended to convert into followers:\n• Necromancers, they do not provide follower service, with the exception of one Breton female Arch Necromancer.\n• Thalmor agents, they do not provide follower service as well.\n• Hold Guard, they do not provide follower dialogues and they always respawn.\n• Characters with \"ElfHaughty,\" \"FemaleNord,\" \"Commander,\" voice set do not contain follower option.\n• Character models made for projecting Daedric Prince voices (Voice of Namira, Molag Bal, Azura, etc.)\n\nThese characters served as spellcasters, decent on ranged attacks, while some are defaultly hostile and requires one to modify their factions first.\n\nThese characters generally have good armor and use weapons effectively, while some are defaultly hostile and requires one to modify their factions first.\n\nThese characters can be found at town and can be converted into followers, they do not have good stat, but easy to be modified.\n\nCharacters either having unique dialogue or unique voice actors."

        "link": "https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Marriage",
        "document": "In Skyrim, you have the option of marrying an NPC, regardless of race or gender. To do so, you must complete the quest The Bonds of Matrimony, which involves speaking with Maramal about marriage and wearing an Amulet of Mara which signifies that you are available to be married. Once you have found an NPC who also wishes to be married, and whose disposition towards you is high enough, you can gain their consent to marry you and then attend the wedding ceremony at the Temple of Mara. After the wedding, if you speak with your new spouse, you can determine where they will live. If you own property, your spouse can move in with you; alternatively, if your spouse owns property, you can move in with them. Spouses will provide a variety of benefits after marriage, such as homecooked meals. When you marry, your spouse becomes protected.\n\nThere are several ways to obtain an Amulet of Mara. The simplest way is to head to the Riften Temple of Mara and buy one from Maramal for 200 gold, but they will also show up in random loot and at merchants. You receive one during the Book of Love quest, which you keep when completed.\n\nYou will not be able to marry anyone until you have spoken to Maramal about marriage, even if you have already obtained an amulet from somewhere else. Maramal can be found in the Temple of Mara, but will initially be found in the Bee and Barb.\n\nWhen you approach an eligible NPC, they may mention the amulet you are wearing. In order for this option to become available, you must complete their objective. Even if a character is flagged as marriageable, the Radiant AI system may not allow you to marry said character even if you have completed their objective, so it's best to have at least one backup candidate.\n\nYou can then ask if they are interested. They will respond and ask if you are interested as well. If you say yes, you can then proceed to marriage. In order to complete the event, you will now need to travel back to the Temple of Mara in Riften and arrange the event. Wait 24 hours and leave the temple then wait for the objective \"Attend your wedding ceremony\" to be displayed. Head back into the Temple of Mara and the wedding will begin.\n\nThe wedding ceremony will begin with Maramal saying, \"Ah here's the blushing bride / proud groom now. Let's begin the ceremony. It was Mara that first gave birth to all of creation and pledged to watch over us as her children. It is from her love of us that we first learned to love one another. It is from this love that we learn that a life lived alone is no life at all. We gather here today, under Mara's loving gaze, to bear witness to the union of two souls in eternal companionship. May they journey forth together in this life and the next, in prosperity and poverty, and in joy and hardship. Do you agree to be bound together, in love, now and forever?\"\n\nYour potential spouse will then reply by saying, \"I do. Now and forever.\" Maramal will then ask you the same question, where you may choose out of two options:\n• \"I do. Now and forever.\" : Maramal will then continue on to say, \"Under the authority of Mara, the Divine of Love, I declare this couple to be wed. I present to the two of you with these matching rings, blessed by Mara's divine grace. May they protect each of you in your new life together.\"\n• \"Stop the wedding! I can't go through with this.\" : Maramal will go on to say \"You're just going to walk out on your betrothal? Get out of the temple now!\" If you try to speak to the rejected NPC afterwards, they will only say \"Get out of my sight.\" Trying to speak with Maramal or any of the guests that attended the wedding ceremony will greet you with \"Just leave.\" or \"Get out.\"\n\n\n\nIf you go through with the ceremony, the wedding guests will congratulate you on the wedding. You should talk to your spouse before they leave the temple to discuss living arrangements. They will open up the conversation by saying, \"Married? It doesn't feel like I thought it would, but I'm happy. We're married. I guess we'll need to decide where we're living, won't we? You can always stay with me.\" You can then choose either to live at your spouse's house or one of your own houses. This decision can be changed later. In the base game, a spouse will move into any house you own. For Hearthfire houses, you must have built a bed for your spouse. If you have children, you will need to have purchased the children's bedroom, or have built enough beds for them, as appropriate for the type of house.\n\nUpon visiting your spouse in whichever house you have chosen, you will be able to ask them about money earned from a store they will have established. Starting the next day, you will be able to collect an accumulating daily income of about 100 gold from your spouse regardless of where he or she resides. In addition, if your spouse has moved into your house with you, he or she will become a merchant, allowing you to buy and sell general items. However, any income your spouse makes from selling items to you does not affect the separate daily 100 gold your spouse makes for you.\n\nNote: If you back out of the wedding, you are able to talk to your jilted fiancé at their default location, where they will greet you with, \"What do you want? There's no words left to say to each other.\" You can choose to reply with:\n• \"It was a mistake. Can we start over?\" : They will agree to start over, and you will be given a second chance at marriage. Speak to Maramal to arrange your wedding, where he will forgive you and allow you to continue with the ceremony again. You can keep repeating the process several times unless you choose to go through with the wedding or choose the option below.\n• \"I never loved you anyway.\" : This will mean that you can never marry that specific NPC again as that NPC will start to dislike you. You can marry another eligible NPC after they express interest.\n• A player's spouse will prepare one homecooked meal a day, which will boost health, stamina, and magicka regeneration by 25% for 600 seconds.\n• Note that though there is a unique dialogue option for each spouse character when asked to prepare this meal, the item received will always be the same.\n• Spouses that are also followers can still follow you, and you can still exchange equipment and items with them. They will still prepare meals for you, even if you are away from your home.\n• Your spouse may occasionally surprise you with a gift.\n• Your spouse will set up a store \"somewhere\" and earn a cumulative 100 gold or more a day for you.\n• If your spouse moves in with you, they will purchase and sell general goods with you. Note that specialized merchant spouses will change to general goods merchants if moved into player housing.[verification needed — contradicted by the following note]\n• If your spouse is naturally a merchant, they will buy and sell the same goods they would normally. If not, they will sell miscellaneous goods and seemingly items you leave in their inventory.\n• You don't need to worry about losing items by placing them in your spouse's inventory because they sold them to someone. Like all merchants in the game, they will actually only sell things to you, and not other people.\n• This inventory is randomized, and seems to reset once every two days (along with the amount of gold your spouse has to offer).\n• Your spouse will not give you additional discounts for being a spouse; prices are still defined by your Speech skill and perks.\n• Sleeping (even for just 1 hour) near your spouse will give you the resting bonus \"Lover's Comfort\", allowing skills to be improved 15% faster for eight hours. Note that this can be used in any unowned bed anywhere in Skyrim, including those in caves and other hostile areas, provided there are no enemies around - very useful if your spouse is also a follower.\n• This effect stacks with the Mage, Warrior and Thief stones.\n• This effect does not appear if you have the effect from The Lover Stone active. You can use the Aetherial CrownDG to store the effect of the Lover Stone; if you take the crown off before getting into bed, then put it back on, whatever effect it has stored will stack with \"Lover's Comfort\".\n• This effect (like all other sleeping bonuses) does not work if you're a werewolf.\n• If your spouse is a follower, move into their house first (even if it's actually your house) then into your preferred residence to benefit from \"Lover's Comfort\".\n\nThe Dawnguard add-on may allow you to turn your spouse into a vampire as a part of the Volkihar clan quest The Gift. This option is not available for all spouses; see the quest page for a list of exceptions.\n\nThis does not work as normal vampirism does, however, as your spouse will still show up with the Detect Life spell and will not use Vampiric Drain. Also, some spouses will not have glowing orange or red eyes, unlike other vampiric NPCs you will find throughout Skyrim. With the Dragonborn add-on installed, spouses obtain a more bat-like face with a split down the middle of the lip or, in the case of an Argonian, a split across the whole face.\n\nIf your spouse has property, you can elect to move in there. Items you place inside their property will not disappear. If you have purchased a house, your spouse may instead be told to move in with you. However, a spouse cannot move into free houses, quest rewards, or faction houses -- only homes which you have purchased. If you have Hearthfire installed, then this includes houses that you have built which have an available bed for your spouse. A spouse's property can be a business property, living property, or both. The property can be anything from an entire house, a single room in a house, or even just a pub/hotel (which they do not actually own), like the Bee and Barb. A spouse's business property may no longer sell items after you move in. If your spouse lives at their own property, they will live normally like before, visiting different places and doing different things. If your spouse moves into your house, they will never leave home, unless they are a follower and you command them. Do note that it may take some time for your spouse to appear at your home, as they actually walk all the way from Riften.\n\nIf you do favors for someone, you may normally sleep in their bed and take some of the cheaper items in their house without it counting as theft. However, the more expensive items they own cannot be taken without counting as theft, and expensive items placed in their containers will become their property. Once married, taking things that belong to your spouse and things placed inside containers they own is no longer considered stealing, as long as the items are worth no more than 500 gold each. If their house is normally locked, you need to initially move in to their house to get their key.\n\nThe spouse's property may amount to nothing more than a bed. For example, Dravynea the Stoneweaver's home is in Braidwood Inn, but she only owns a bed inside a small room, and she shares that room with others who still live there after you marry her. None of the chests and items in the small room and elsewhere in the inn belong to her. To make the matter even worse, you can already sleep in her bed before marriage after doing her a favor, so getting her property (a bed) after marriage is not a good investment. Renting a room in Braidwood Inn only rents out the master bed for 24 in-game hours, and has no effect on surrounding chests or items. Note that if your spouse shares ownership of a house with someone else before marriage, other people will be living there after marriage even if you elect to move in with them. If a spouse is flagged as a merchant, and there is already someone else that shares the business property with the spouse, your spouse may not be a merchant until that other person (or persons) are dead.\n\nIf you are near the beginning of the game and don't have enough money to purchase a house, you can marry someone with a house and use that until you get enough funds of your own. The table below lists the property owned by all available spouses. Almost all spouses own at least a bed.\n\nNPCs available to be married\n• The blank spaces in Spouse's Property may be incomplete. Please fill in missing information.\n• The blank spaces in other columns are correct and means \"no\" or \"none\".\n\nThese two tables give details on all of the possible spouses, including their race, location, what property they own (if any), ability to follow, merchant type (if already merchant before marriage), training possibilities, and any special prerequisite tasks for that specific marriage prospect. A follower spouse is able to go with you on quests and take orders. Your spouse does not become hostile if you are caught stealing from them, but won't let you steal anymore. The gold they carry is separate from the merchant gold they get from bartering (you can't steal that).\n\nThe merchandise that your spouse will sell you depends upon whether or not your spouse was originally a merchant and, if so, what type of merchandise they originally sold. In each case, the merchandise is typical of a generic merchant of that type.\n\nAll standard merchandise is located in a Merchant Chest; it cannot be pickpocketed or stolen. The merchant chest is restocked every two days. Also, if you buy any items from your spouse, the gold is placed in the merchant chest, not in their personal inventory, meaning you cannot take it back from your spouse, even a follower spouse.\n\nThese are the goods sold if your spouse was originally an apothecary merchant.\n\nThese are the goods sold if your spouse was originally a blacksmith.\n\nThese are the goods sold if your spouse was originally an innkeeper.\n\nThese are the goods sold if your spouse was originally a spell merchant.\n• The Bonds of Matrimony: Find someone in Skyrim to marry.\n• The GiftDG: Turn your spouse into a creature of the night.\n\nMarriage allows you to unlock one achievement:\n• There are no Khajiit, Bosmer, male Redguard or male Altmer characters that you can marry (without using console commands on the PC version of the game).\n• Even NPCs that have romantic ties with or interest in another NPC (Ysolda, Sorex Vinius, Aela the Huntress, Camilla Valerius, Viola Giordano) or NPCs that explicitly state having no interest in marriage (Borgakh the Steel Heart, Roggi Knot-Beard) will still accept your request.\n• Maramal says to meet back \"tomorrow, from dawn til dusk\". Technically this is incorrect; he will conduct the ceremony any time after midnight, provided a whole number of hours has passed since you asked him to conduct the ceremony. So, if you ask him to conduct the ceremony at 11:59 p.m., he will offer to conduct it a mere one hour later, at 12:59 a.m.\n• Certain quest paths and character interactions can make the disposition quests for some potential spouses permanently unavailable. If you wish to get married to a specific character, do so as early as possible to minimize the risk of this. Additionally, most disposition quests are in a radiant group with similar quests, only one of which can be active at a time, so doing a favor for someone else may make your intended's quest unavailable until you complete the \"blocking\" errand.\n• If you are not sure what property a spouse has before marrying them, you can follow them and find out where they usually sleep at night. If they always stay in the same bed, that is usually their property. Next, check if the chests and items near the bed are named in red, indicating that to take from them is stealing. Do the favors or quests required by the potential spouse and check the chests and items near the bed again. If they change from red to non-red, then those items are your spouse's property. Note that some items owned by the potential spouse may not change to non-red until after marriage. Any items that change from red to non-red in your spouse's house after marriage belong to your spouse. Likewise, any items still red after marriage never belonged to your spouse. The same procedure can be used to verify bed ownership. A spouse can own an entire house or just part of it, especially if they live with other people before marriage. Special care should be taken with chests, as chests may be owned by other members of the house. A chest owned by your spouse after marriage is a safe place to put items, whether you move in or not.\n• On console versions, the chest at the foot of Sylgja's bed is not safe storage for her spouse, though it seems she owns the entire property herself.\n• Special care should be taken in determining what property is actually owned by your spouse. Being considered a friend after doing favors for them allows you to take items from where they live without stealing, but that does not mean the spouse owns the whole house. If you are not sure if your spouse owns a house or not, simply put items in chests inside the house after marriage and after you have moved in. If your items disappear after a while, then your spouse probably only owns a bed, not the whole house. You can put items in different areas of the house (and inside chests) to determine the extent of the property owned by your spouse. Killing other members living in a business property will usually trigger your spouse to be the default merchant listed, to verify whether they are actually selling the stuff listed.\n• If you kill the other merchant or merchants of a business so that your future spouse can become a merchant themselves, they may not give you the marriage dialogue to start the marriage. This happens for Camilla Valerius and Muiri.\n• If you decide to store stolen items in your or your spouse's home, some spouses will alert the guards if they see you take the items. This does not apply to stolen items in a container.\n• If Hearthfire is installed and you have children, your spouse will mention that you will need room for them somewhere after getting married.\n• Steps to re-marry using console commands:\n• Then proceed to marry as normal.\n• Sometimes the steps listed above won't work, but you can also try the following:\n• Drop the Amulet of Mara from your inventory.\n• Go to Riften and talk to Maramal. He will start the quest from scratch.\n• It's possible that this doesn't work the first time you try it, and you may have to reload the game.\n• Also, make sure you don't talk to Maramal before you dropped the Amulet of Mara.\n• If your spouse becomes a Blade (either before or after marriage), then your spouse's home moves to Sky Haven Temple, although you can still move your spouse to a house you own. See Rebuilding the Blades for details.\n• If you used the following solutions on a spouse that was a merchant you will have to use the console to reinstate it.\n• If one of your followers dies before the marriage can take place, their body will turn up at the temple, causing you to fail the wedding ceremony mini-mission. The priests will then ask you to leave, and the bride or groom will storm off, angry. You can make amends by leaving a short cool down period of a couple of hours, and then going and apologizing to Maramal and then your potential spouse. The wedding will take place the following day at the same time. To avoid failing the quest a second time, drag (or use unrelenting force to push) the corpse from out the way of the door. If you are using the PC, you can also use the console to resurrect the follower then apologize to avoid a problem.\n• The Official Skyrim Patch, version 1.2, fixes this bug.\n• If your spouse dies, you will not be able to remarry.\n• It appears that if you resurrect your spouse using the console then they are no longer married to you. You can still buy/sell merchandise, but other spouse dialogue is not available and, if you moved them to your own house, they no longer live there.\n• Although listed as possible marriage options, there have been many reports of some NPCs (Lydia being the most common example) as not having the dialogue required for marriage.\n• The Official Skyrim Patch, version 1.5, addresses this issue. It is unclear if any NPCs other than Lydia are fixed by this patch.\n• This can also be fixed via the console by typing after clicking on the desired NPC. This adds them to the potential marriage options faction.\n• One day you may find your spouse no longer offers you a Homecooked Meal because the dialogue \"Would you mind cooking something for me?\" disappears.\n• This can by fixed by remarrying via console (see the how-to in the notes).\n• In most cases the NPC spouse disappears after exiting the Temple of Mara, unless you exit dialogue with Maramal and rush after them before they reach the door. If this happens, you may find your new spouse in the spot where you first met; you can then talk to the person to decide where you'll both live. In some cases, the spouse seems to disappear from the game completely.\n• This is easily solved by using the console command , which will move you to the spouse position.\n• Sometimes after your wedding is scheduled, within a few in-game hours, it may say to attend your wedding even though Maramal said it was supposed to be scheduled for the next day. Because of this, you may fail the mission automatically due to the time being unpredictable and makes your fiance mad, etc. The cause of this is not known, but can be fixed by reloading the last save before you scheduled the wedding.\n• A very similar glitch exists that also makes the wedding take place the same day, but does not cause you to fail the mission.\n• When the spouse disappears, the game still treats a spouse as \"alive\" even when they have disappeared forever.\n• It is also possible for NPCs who attend your wedding to vanish forever in the aftermath, however this is considerably more rare and seems to only affect Camilla Valerius.\n• Going outside the Temple of Mara and waiting for a day, then re-entering should fix this problem.[verification needed]\n• If you move your spouse directly into your own home, the Lover's Comfort effect may not activate correctly on sleeping. This can be fixed by asking them to move back to their original home (you should get a \"Visit your spouse's house\" journal update at this point, if things are working properly) and sleeping there to activate the effect, then telling them you want to move to whichever house you actually want to live in. Alternatively, you can enable Lover's Comfort by using and in the console, then either completing the quest as normal or using (there is no need for the spouse to move into their house, nor to for you to sleep there, so this also works in the event of the Hearthfire bug listed below). Spouses who stayed at inns before marriage may not actually sleep in those places, but Lover's Comfort should activate if you pay to spend a night at that inn.\n• This is especially broken if you marry your Housecarl. Telling e.g. Jordis that you should live in your house in Solitude will not fix this bug: you have to use the conversation option for \"their\" house, even though it's the same place.\n• If you have Hearthfire installed, and have one or two adopted children before getting married, you will not have a conversation option to stay at your spouse's home, even if you are marrying a housecarl of a house which has children's bedrooms installed in it.\n• If you ask your spouse to move into a house with you, any items that you have stored in the house could disappear and show up under your spouse's Sale option. You will have to buy the items to reclaim them if they are lost.\n• It appears that Speech is not a modifier for buying items from your spouse. You will be required to buy the items at full price if you want them back.\n• With Hearthfire if your spouse is kidnapped they will start to walk backwards (as a follower) will not attack. [verification needed — What type of kidnapped? Bandit AttackHF or RescueDG or both?]\n• Typing in the console, while targeting your spouse fixes this.\n• While Odfel is part of the marriage faction, there is no way to raise his disposition in order for the option to appear.\n• You can manually set his relationship rank to 'friend' with the console. Open the console and target him (by clicking on him or typing ) and type ."

        "document": "Marriage is a gameplay element in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. After obtaining the Amulet of Mara, the Dragonborn has the option to engage in marriage with an eligible character. There are no eligible Khajiit, Bosmer, male Redguard, or male Altmer candidates. Those that can be married generally require that a specific task be completed beforehand. Whether the partner is a merchant or not, after marriage, they are able to purchase and sell general goods, also allowing the Dragonborn to collect a daily portion of their profits from their \"work.\" Every 24 hours, the Dragonborn can ask their spouse how business is faring to receive a share of 100 . If the share is not collected, the gold accumulates.\n• An Amulet of Mara can be bought from a priest named Maramal for 200 . He can be found in Riften, either in the Bee and Barb or the Temple of Mara.\n• Can be found in the Lover's Tent on a beach north of Dawnstar directly behind the Dawnstar Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary.\n• Can be found as random loot in chests or on corpses.\n• Received after completing \"The Book of Love\" quest.\n\nMaramal must be asked about marriage in Skyrim before any dialogue related to the Amulet of Mara shows up.\n\nThe new dialogue is unlocked with certain characters if the Dragonborn is both wearing the amulet and has met the requirement relating to the individual, usually a quest. The Dragonborn can then express their wish to marry the person. Once that is done, they can speak to Maramal at the Temple of Mara about arranging the wedding.\n\nThe ceremony will start no sooner than approximately 24 hours. one of the easiest ways to make time move faster is to rent a room at the bee and the barb and sleep there for 24 hours. Maramal alludes to the ceremony time being constrained between dawn and dusk; however, the ceremony can happen at any given hour of the day. During the ceremony, the Dragonborn has one last chance to affirm the marriage before the ceremony proceeds. Upon accepting the marriage, Maramal makes the marriage official and gives the Dragonborn The Bond of Matrimony.\n\nCharacters for whom quests have previously been completed or other characters who disposition is positive may appear at the wedding ceremony as guests. If the Dragonborn already owns any houses, then the corresponding housecarl(s) may also be present. In the case of a few potential spouses, characters who are important to that character may appear as well.\n\nIf the Dragonborn misses their wedding ceremony, they can approach the intended partner and ask for another chance. Maramal will then agree to host another ceremony, the next day.\n\nOnce the marriage ceremony is complete and the Dragonborn addresses their new spouse, the spouse will inquire where the Dragonborn wants to live. If the spouse owns property, that will be presented as an option; the Dragonborn may also select any of the house(s) they currently own. The selection need not be permanent; relocation to any of the available homes is available at any time by initiating the appropriate dialogue with the spouse.\n\nIf the spouse is the Dragonborn's housecarl, \"their house\" is the applicable house of the Dragonborn that they are responsible for.\n\nOnce married, the behavior of the spouse changes. Most notably, the tone of voice and behavior changes and they will often refer to the Dragonborn as \"love\" or \"dear\" from that point on. However, if the Dragonborn marries one of their housecarls, the Dragonborn will still be referred to as \"my Thane\" using subordinate dialogue.\n\nIf the Dragonborn's spouse relocates to a different city from where they originated to live in one of the Dragonborn's houses, they may indicate that they wish to become a shop owner to keep occupied while the Dragonborn is out adventuring.\n\nOnce a day, the Dragonborn can ask their spouse to cook something. The spouse will make a homemade meal, which increases the regeneration of Magicka, Health, and Stamina.\n\nIf the Dragonborn sleeps in the house with the spouse, the Dragonborn will receive a temporary bonus called \"Lover's Comfort\" that boosts the rate of skill-learning by 15% for 8 hours. However, this bonus cannot be obtained if the Lover Stone is activated (a workaround can be used with the Aetherial Crown), or if the Blood Ritual has been taken to become a Werewolf.\n\nIf the Official Plug-in Hearthfire is installed, marriage can also include children. The Dragonborn's adopted child will also be adopted by the spouse, as well as instantly move into the house where the Dragonborn's new son or daughter is living. This adds another dialogue option with the spouse allowing the Dragonborn to ask how the children are; it also adds generic dialogue to the child, where an activity will be mentioned that they both did together.\n\nNote: Because spouses act as vendors, the Dragonborn can buy and sell items from them. However, if the spouse is a follower and asked to follow the Dragonborn, the spouse will only sell items from their inventory until they part ways. Spouses only act as merchants in the marital home, meaning items cannot be sold to them while they are following (to reduce the carry weight, for instance).\n\nThe marriage dialog option can be forced to appear on characters by opening the console, targeting the desired character, and typing the command \" .\" This could possibly cause issues with characters who were not originally intended to have this option.\n\nA friendship must have been started with the character in the form of a quest, as their disposition (which is a hidden stat) needs to be of a certain level in order for them to recognize the Amulet of Mara. Alternatively the command \" \" can be used after adding the person to the marriage faction. It is not possible to marry several of the people in the game, such as Ulfric Stormcloak.\n• Forced marriages often work better on characters that share a voice actor with a marriageable character, because marriage dialogue is universal for a lot of characters.\n• If the Dragonborn marries a Jarl with the command, they can immediately buy a house from said Jarl as well. Note that these commands may cause buggy behavior when trying to become Thane of a Hold. However, a benefit of marrying an important character, such as a trainer at the College of Winterhold, is that one can choose to live with their spouse in the formal residence, since taking an item while one lives there does not count as stealing.\n\nTrying to breakup with partners is impossible without the console commands. Searching for will bring up dialogue and quests that show reference to what most likely was the original intention of breaking up with a spouse.\n\nThe relationshipbreakup quest can be used. PC Use the console to enter these commands:\n\n(This is just formality to reset the \"marriage\" quest.) The above will prevent the Dragonborn from having to kill their spouse, although they will comment on how much even the thought of them makes their blood boil. Untested, but possibly can fix this.\n• The spouse must be killed\n• The console command must then be used\n• The console commands should next be used on the ex-spouse (and eventually the command on him/her to keep the relationship status obtained with the character related quests)\n• The old Amulet of Mara doesn't need to be dropped or sold.\n• The Amulet of Mara necklace must be retained, or another one must be found.\n• Any wanted items should be taken from the current spouse before starting this process.\n• The following commands must be used, after targeting the spouse:\n• The old spouse will immediately exit the house and return to their regular location.\n• To change the clothes of the partner, the console command can be used on them (e.g. for the Tavern Clothes). The console command can be used to remove items like a pickaxe ( ), or clothes specifically. Be mindful that all Characters (including followers) come with a set of standard clothing that are tagged as their 'outfit'. Even when removing these clothes through the console, the character will try to put on the standard outfit when not following the Dragonborn, which can result in them being randomly nude while not following the Dragonborn (e.g.: waiting at their house, walking in the city).\n• The Dragonborn can also change their spouse's clothes on consoles if they are a follower by equipping them with items of better armor value and buying their normally-worn items in their shops; however, when not following they might be wandering in their underwear.\n• The Dragonborn can kill their spouse by sacrificing them to Boethiah during the quest \"Boethiah's Calling.\"\n• If a spouse is killed, remarriage is not possible without the use of console commands.\n• There is a number of potential marriage options cut from the game that still have related (but disabled) data included in the game files. Among those characters who were cut are Vivienne Onis, Ingun Black-Briar, and Elisif the Fair.\n• The Dunmer of Raven Rock cannot be married via console commands. The Nords of Skaal Village can be married this way, but are bugged (and thus may not leave Solstheim).\n• Serana has the option of proposal but will kindly refuse.\n• If a follower is married and is currently accompanying the player, they can still provide homemade meals whilst not being near any cooking facilities. Also, they can still give the \"profits\" of their shops, even though they are following the player and will not have had the opportunity to \"sell\" anything.\n• All marriageable male Dunmer, with the exception of Revyn Sadri, share the same courtship dialogue about the Amulet of Mara and after-marriage conversations.\n• Muiri is the only female spouse who is a dedicated apothecary, if Bothela is killed prior to marriage. Quintus Navale is the only male spouse who is a dedicated apothecary.\n• If the Dawnguard add-on is installed, when talking with Florentius Baenius, the Dragonborn can occasionally learn that their spouse has been kidnapped by vampires at the beginning of the quest \"Rescue.\"\n• The majority of spouse options are Nords and Imperials, with some Elves, Bretons, Orcs and Argonians mixed in. There are no Khajiit spouses, however; since the majority of Khajiit in Skyrim are traders or travelers from Elsweyr, they probably have families back home. Additionally, Khajiit characters talk about home a lot, stating how much they miss it and how cold Skyrim is; thus, they probably do not want to marry and settle down in Skyrim.\n• Sometimes, the wedding ceremony will not actually start; the Dragonborn's spouse, guests, and Maramal are at the temple at the proper time, but the ceremony proper will not happen. Guests offer their generic congratulations, and the spouse expresses excitement, but nothing else happens and the quest will fail after a few in-game hours.\n• Sometimes, Maramal will not show up at the temple until he is talked to at the Bee and Barb.\n• If a follower (such as Lydia) dies before the wedding, their dead body will be present at the wedding.\n• A scripted character may interrupt the wedding if the Dragonborn chooses to wait overnight in the Temple of Mara. For example: the priestess of Azura might make the Dragonborn miss their wedding if they recently completed the \"The Black Star.\"\n• When married to Camilla Valerius, Sven will still ask the Dragonborn to break up the relationship between Camilla and Feandal (in the quest \"A Lovely Letter\"). The Dragonborn can still complete the quest despite being married to her.\n• If Aela the Huntress is taken to Riften to get married while on the quest to recover any Hircine totem, she will continue to normally follow the Dragonborn, but will disappear upon fast traveling.\n• If a random Companions quest is accepted and the quest requires killing a monster that has invaded a home, that home may be the Dragonborn's. Upon entering the home no one will be there but the monster and the spouse will temporarily disappear from the game.\n• With the Dragonborn DLC, the Dragonborn's spouse may never appear at the designated house, but wander around their default location instead.\n• This can be fixed by making the spouse a follower before leaving the hold and leaving them in the Dragonborn's home, then making them a follower again and ask them about living somewhere else. Upon leaving them there, they will live there as normal.\n• Another solution is to divorce the spouse and remarry.\n• If Maramal is summoned through console commands and the original scripted Maramal was accidentally deleted, it may result in Maramal not present during wedding and the Dragonborn \"automatically refuse\" to marry the spouse.\n• Sleeping in the same house with the partner may not result in the \"Lover's Comfort\" buff, only the standard \"Well Rested\" bonus.\n• Any wife may stop cooking meals for her Dragonborn spouse after about 5–7 times.\n• Some people that can be married, such as Aela the Huntress, have no voice recorded for when they are asked to show their merchandise. The subtitle will appear on screen and their lips still move but nothing will be heard.\n• During the marriage ceremony, after the spouse gives their vows, they will sometimes randomly leave the temple while Maramal is still talking, and will disappear, not to be found anywhere.\n• This can be avoided by quickly leaving the ceremony and initiating conversation with the spouse about where to live.\n• In rare cases, the wedding will not occur on the actual day, but the day after. The spouse will still say what they normally say (e.g. \"It's our wedding day! I feel like the whole of Skyrim is focused on the two of us.\").\n• The marriage quest may fail after the wedding ceremony. If this happens, the Dragonborn should talk to their new spouse and ask them for another chance at marriage. This should automatically make the Dragonborn's new spouse work properly.\n• Potential spouses may call the Dragonborn \"love\" or \"dear,\" despite not being married to them, or even being married to someone else. This most often happens after any Dawnguard radiant quest involving the potential spouse in question is completed.\n• Vigilance may be chosen as a wedding guest if he is waiting inside one of the Dragonborn's homes. After the wedding, he is released back to Banning instead of returning home."

        "document": "This page covers how to get married in Skyrim - what you'll need to unlock the marriage option, who can you get hitched to, the benefits of being married in Skyrim, and how to end a marriage in The Elder Scrolls 5. You might find it surprising, but Skyrim marriage is a real thing, as love can blossom in even the deepest tundras and war-torn areas of Skyrim -- you only need to know where to look.\n\n\n\nIn order to show that you are open to romance - ie. to unlock the option to get married - you must find and equip an Amulet of Mara. This necklace opens up extra dialogue with viable suitors. The general rule of thumb: If you help people out, they're more inclined to like you.\n\nTo purchase it, find Maramal in the Temple of Mara, in Riften, and ask to be enlightened about Mara, the Goddess of Love and about marriage in Skyrim. Push the query further to receive the option to purchase the Amulet of Mara from him for 200 gold. You can't get married without talking to Maramal!\n\nEquip the amulet and speak to an NPC that has expressed some sort of interest in you. There are obvious verbal cues, such as \"It's a nice day when you're around.\"\n\nWatch the video above to see our pics for the best marriage partners in Skyrim, or check out the full list of Marriage Partners that you can romance throughout the game.\n\nIf there is a relationship to foster, you’ll get the extra dialogue option asking the person whether he or she is interested in you. Accept this crude and elementary portrayal of love and the elated person will urge you to set up the wedding ceremony forthwith!\n\nSpeak to Maramal at the Temple of Mara about arranging your wedding. The time to the start of the ceremony is approximately 24 hours from the hour you first initiate the wedding preparations. It’s recommended that you stay at the Temple of Mara to avoid standing up your to-be spouse. Once the knot has been tied, you’ll earn the Achievement/Trophy Married.\n\nEstablish a place of residence for your new family. Your spouse (whether or not he or she is a store owner) gives you 100 gold and a homecooked meal once per day upon request.\n\nEven if you don't set foot in the house where your lover stays for a while, the amount of gold she/he gives you will mount up, creating a nice hefty sum to add to your pocket.\n\nAdditionally, sleeping in the same house as your spouse gives you the \"Lover's Comfort\" resting bonus, which increases the speed at which you gain skill experience by 15% for 8 hours. Finally, if you so wish, you may ask certain partners to become a Follower, even if they would not normally be available as one.\n\nFor good or bad there is a way to back out of your marriage in case you find a more suitable partner or got stuck with coyote ugly because you needed a place to couch surf. \"Till death do us part,\" yep, you guessed it, if you *ahem* kill your spouse (preferably inside your house to avoid bounty) then you can re-equip the amulet and go searching for another lover, you serial killer you.\n\nOne of the most common glitches during weddings is when your dead follower's corpse appears as your fiancee and your guests appear in the Temple of Mara, failing the ceremony instantly (and with everyone, including the priest, pissed at you). Reloading or relaunching the game won't help."
