        "document": "Transactional emails are a key piece of your order fulfillment process. They update your customers on their order status, provide valuable information about policies and returns, and are opportunities to encourage repeat sales.\n\nIn fact, transactional emails have an open rate of 80-85%, while most marketing emails only average around 20-25%. In spite of those impressive numbers, the majority of businesses don’t customize their transactional emails. And if they’re generic, it’s likely that your shoppers will simply glance at the information they need and move on. This is a big missed opportunity!\n\nCustomizing the content of your emails builds trust by providing helpful information that will enable shoppers to make the most of their purchase. Using your own colors, fonts, and language reinforces your brand, provides consistency, and helps you be remembered. And including related products and coupon codes can even lead to additional purchases.\n\nWooCommerce provides built-in functionality that automatically sends customers emails based on order status. How can you adapt these to best fit your business and brand?\n\nTo view and update email settings, log into your WordPress dashboard. In the left-hand menu, click on WooCommerce → Settings.\n\nThere, you’ll find several tabs at the top. Click Emails to view the following templates:\n• New Order: Sent to the store admin to notify them of a new order.\n• Canceled Order: Sent to the store admin to notify them of a canceled order.\n• Failed Order: Sent to the store admin to notify them of a failed order.\n• Order On-Hold: Sent to customers with details if their order is placed on hold.\n• Order Processing: Sent to customers after a completed payment; contains order details.\n• Order Completed: Sent to customers when their orders are marked completed; indicates that the order has been shipped.\n• Order Refunded: Sent to customers when an order is refunded.\n• Customer Invoice: Sent to customers; contains order information and payment links.\n• Customer Note: Sent when a customer note is added in the dashboard.\n• Password Reset: Sent to a customer after they request to reset their password.\n• New Account: Sent to the customer when they create an account.\n\nClick the Manage button to the far right of the email template that you’d like to edit. There, you can customize the email subject line, heading, content, and type. You can also use placeholder values to quickly and automatically fill in relevant information, like your {site_title}, the {order_date}, or {order_number}. These variables let you personalize emails for each individual order.\n\nThe Additional Content field can be especially helpful for emails that are sent to your customers, like the Completed Order email. Including a special thank you note helps your buyers feel appreciated and adds a touch of brand personality.\n\nAlso consider linking to warranty information, return policies, and other documentation that applies to all of your products. Customers should be able to easily access everything they need to know after they make a purchase.\n\nIf you scroll below the list of email templates in WooCommerce Settings → Emails, you’ll see global customization options. Note that changing these options will update all of your email templates at once.\n\nYou can make changes to your:\n• Header image: An image that you’d like to display at the top of all emails. You might want to use your logo or other brand graphics here.\n• Footer text: Information found at the bottom of each email. Include a link to your website and contact information to make it easy for your customers to get in touch.\n• Base color: The color used for headings, links, and the background of your email title.\n• Background color: The color used for the background of the email.\n• Body background color: The color of your email content background.\n• Body text color: The color for all written email content.\n\nClick the link that says, “click here to preview your email template” to preview your emails.\n\nUpdating elements like color and font to match your website and branding provide a more seamless experience for your customers. After all, if your website uses a blue and yellow color scheme, and the email that your customer receives is orange, they might be confused. If a shopper knows what to expect and feels comfortable with a brand, they’re more likely to become a long-term, loyal customer.\n\nIf you sell different types of products, you might want to include specific information that applies to each one in your customer emails. To do this, go to Products and click Edit under the product you want to change. Scroll down to the Product Data section and click Advanced. There, you’ll see a blank box where you can add a Purchase Note.\n\nPurchase Notes can be used in a variety of ways. You could link to a PDF instruction manual or page your customer has special access to. Or, you could include a coupon code for a discount off their next purchase. The goal is to provide as much valuable information as possible to your customers so that they’ll love your products and keep coming back.\n\nWith the Klaviyo WooCommerce extension, you can take advantage of powerful tools, like high-converting email templates, customized triggers, A/B testing, cart reminders, and more. It syncs seamlessly with your online store so that you can truly personalize your email marketing. Here’s how to get started:\n• Install the Klaviyo for WooCommerce extension linked above, then activate it.\n• In your WordPress dashboard, go to Marketing → Klaviyo. Click Connect, then proceed through the setup prompts.\n\nNow, you’ll create and customize your transactional emails within your Klaviyo account. To create a transactional email:\n• Navigate to the Flows tab inside of Klaviyo.\n• Design your flow using Klaviyo’s builder, and customize your flow emails.\n• Select a transactional message and click Apply for transactional status. Klaviyo will review your message and approve or reject it within 24 hours.\n\nThe Klaviyo email template editor enables you to build transactional emails using blocks and layouts. By dragging and dropping these into place, you can add text, images, buttons, and more. Plus, you can use the Styles tab to make design changes to the entire email — e.g. edit the background, width, heading style, font, text alignment, and mobile design.\n\nIf you want to get a jumpstart on creating your flow — or build additional email marketing funnels — you can choose from a wide range of pre-built options that are completely customizable. There are 60+ available, including:\n\nHere’s a visual of some of the flow use cases:\n\nYou can also set advanced segmentation rules based on everything from customer behavior and demographics to channel history and location. The options are truly endless!\n\nThe MailPoet extension allows you to harness the marketing and customization power of MailPoet for your transactional emails. Start by installing the extension from your WordPress dashboard, just as you would any other plugin. Then:\n• Go to MailPoet → Settings → WooCommerce in your WordPress dashboard, select Use MailPoet to Customize Your WooCommerce Emails and save your settings.\n\nNow, you’ll use MailPoet’s drag-and-drop editor to make the changes you’d like. Note that the template you’re editing controls the look and feel of all WooCommerce emails, not each one individually. But you can freely edit the areas above and below the email header and primary content area (the space where order information, etc. is displayed). Here are a few things you can do:\n• Add your logo to the top of the email\n• Change the colors to match your brand\n• Add a button that links to important content, instruction manuals, support forums, or exclusive offers for new customers.\n• Place links to your social media accounts to encourage engagement\n\nEach of those changes just require you to drag and drop content into place — that’s it! No editing templates or writing code. For more information, see the guide to editing WooCommerce emails with MailPoet.\n\nAnd the best part is that, with MailPoet, you can also take advantage of other marketing tools. Send email newsletters with updates, discounts, or product recommendations. Reach out to new customers with a welcome message or exclusive coupon. Tailor messaging based on the specific product each person purchased. Send abandoned cart emails to those who add products to their cart without checking out. The sky’s the limit!\n\nThe audience segmentation options in MailPoet are robust, and allow you to customize your emails so they’re hyper relevant. Here are just a few of the segmentation options you can use:\n• Whether or not someone clicked a specific link (or any link)\n• Whether someone purchased within a specific category\n• Whether someone has an active subscription\n\nYou also won’t have to worry about email deliverability — MailPoet has a 99% deliverability rate, so you can rest easy knowing that your transactional emails will arrive in the customer’s inbox.\n\nIf you’re a developer or are comfortable editing PHP files, WooCommerce provides everything you need to make changes to transactional email templates.\n\nIn the left-hand menu of your WordPress dashboard, select WooCommerce → Settings. Then, click the Emails tab at the top. Find the email that you’d like to customize and click the Manage button at the far right. At the bottom of that page, there’s a note that tells you which PHP template is associated with that email.\n\nEvery transactional email consists of a combination of templates. This allows you more control over customization than the other methods listed here.\n\nFor example, if you only want to edit your email header, you’ll just need to make edits to the email-header.php file. For changes in the footer, you’ll work with email-footer.php. To edit a specific email template, like the customer invoice, you’ll change customer-invoice.php.\n\nLet’s say that you want to update the color of any links included in your emails:\n• Copy the file found at wp-content/plugins/woocommerce/templates/emails/email-styles.php into your store’s child theme. Note that if you customize the parent theme rather than the child theme, any changes will be overwritten with theme updates.\n• Find the “link” class in the copied file.\n• Edit the code to change the link color.\n\nThere are endless customizations you can make. To find out more information on the template structure for WooCommerce emails, check out the Template Structure documentation.\n\nWooCommerce hooks are a great way to add content to the layout of your emails. Keep in mind that hooks will allow you to add content but not modify existing text. To modify text, see the section above on customizing templates.\n\nAdd the snippets below to your child theme’s functions.php file. The hooks that you use depend on what you want to add and where you want to place the content.\n\nTo add content below the header, use the woocommerce_email_header( $email_heading, $email ) hook:\n\nTo add content below the order table, use the woocommerce_email_after_order_table ($order, $sent_to_admin, $plain_text, $email) hook:\n\nTo add content above the footer, use the woocommerce_email_footer($email) hook:\n\nNote: These hooks and customization options are tightly linked to the theme you’re using because of the functions.php file location within your theme files. If you change your theme, you’ll have to move your modified template files or hooks to your new theme.\n\nFor more information, read our WooCommerce Hooks documentation..\n\nCustomizing the design and content of your emails helps you more successfully update buyers on order progress, promote brand awareness, and encourage repeat sales. No matter what level of coding experience you have, WooCommerce provides a variety of ways to make the changes that you need.\n\nHow have you customized your transactional emails to increase sales?

        "document": "As a business, we all want to grab our customers’ attention and keep them engaged. But let’s face it: sending plain and formal emails won’t cut it anymore. With email marketing becoming more and more popular, it’s crucial to personalize your messages to stand out from the crowd.\n\nLuckily, there’s a tool that can help you take your WooCommerce email customization game to a whole new level: the WooCommerce Email Hook. Not sure what that is? No worries, we’ve got you covered!\n\nIn this blog post, we’ll give you the scoop on what WooCommerce email hook is, how it works, and how you can supercharge it with YayMail – WooCommerce email customizer tool.\n\nA WooCommerce hook lets you “hook in” to a specific part of your WooCommerce store to add new functionality/data or modify your site’s existing behavior.\n\nFor example, you can use hooks to add text or icons to your shopping cart or checkout pages, modify your single product pages, and lots more.\n\nIn web development, hooks are utilized for specifying markup across all pages, streamlining the process of performing Actions and Filters on them. These hooks enable developers to modify or add code without editing core files, making them an invaluable tool for web development.\n\nTwo types of hooks are available: Actions and Filters.\n\nThese hooks are executed whenever the specified action is triggered. To use an action hook, you need to hook in with the function and write your own code.\n\nYou should place your code in the function, where is the name of the function that contains your custom code.\n\nFilter hooks are a useful tool for modifying variables in code, such as product prices.\n\nWhen using filter hooks, you can apply the function to call them in your code.\n\nTo modify the passed variable, you can use the function and define to include the desired alterations to the variable.\n\nFinally, is used to ensure the modified variable is returned.\n\nAs an end-user, the big benefit of WordPress hooks is that they make it a lot easier for you to modify how your site works or insert new content.\n\nWithout hooks, you would need to manually edit your child theme’s template files every time you wanted to make a modification to your site’s code.\n\nSo What are WooCommerce Email Hooks?\n\nSimilarly, if you want to add some additional content to the emails, you can use different email hooks defined by WooCommerce.\n\nSo you need to keep in mind that hooks will let you add additional content but not modify the existing text. If you want to modify the existing text, you will need to override the templates.\n\nYou may want to learn more about WooCommerce visual hook guide.\n\nNow let’s try to add some content to various parts of the email. I believe it will make a significant and dynamic difference to your email. We can use various hooks depending on where we want to place the content.\n\nBasically, WooCommerce doesn’t do a great job of listing out email-only actions and filters, but here are a few listed in the documentation:\n• is used to place the custom content just below the header.\n• places the content below the header.\n• places the content above the order details table.\n• places the content below the item name in the order table. This meta will be added first before any other meta.\n• places the content below the item\n• will be added at last after all the other meta information.\n• places the content just below the order table.\n• places the content after the order table and below the hook .\n• places the content before the customer billing & shipping address.\n• places the extra content just above the footer text.\n• places the item meta data that reflect the product variation in the order table.\n\nHere is an example of email hooks in a WooCommerce email.\n\nTo add the code mentioned above, you can navigate to your theme’s functions.php file or a plugin file. Once you’ve added the code, the email sent to the customer will display as shown in the screenshot below.\n\nThis illustrates the various options that can be customized through the settings available in WooCommerce. It also highlights the situations where it may be necessary to override the default templates.\n\nPrimarily as you can see, the only way to customize your WooCommerce emails to your liking is to hook into actions and filters to add and change email content where you need it as in the example above.\n\nHowever, if you prefer a more time-saving approach, the upcoming section offers an inventive WooCommerce email customizer option. With this solution, you can add and modify the hooks in your WooCommerce emails without writing a code line. It’s all about the drag-and-drop interface.\n\nYayMail provides a Hooked Element feature that allows you to add any content to various areas of the WooCommerce email template. This opens up a lot of flexibility and customization options for WooCommerce custom emails.\n\nJust Drag & Drop The Hooks and Format Them!\n\nIn particular, we build the email customizer framework where users can easily drag and drop elements functioning with all the hooks above. To simplify, the Email Hooks in the default WooCommerce email builder can be compared to Elements in YayMail’s email builder.\n\nAnd of course, YayMail provides more hooks than WooCommerce default hooks to meet all of your needs. All you have to do is drag and drop the elements into the suitable position, then modify the format.\n\nRead more: All YayMail’s Elements Supercharging your WooCommerce Email\n\nWhat’s more, in YayMail, you can add any types of additional content that you want for the hooks and .\n\nThis feature is absolutely useful when you intend to add information that was created from a third-party plugin.\n\nLet’s jump into the guideline on how to customize the hooks in YayMail.\n\nGo to WooCommerce > Email Customizer. In the Elements Tab, come to WooCommerce Element. Drag Hook into the position you want.\n\nHere I drag Hooks elements into two positions including before and after the order table.\n\nStep 2: Choose the Right Type of Hook\n\nNext, choose the hook and select Before or After in the section WC hook order item.\n\nThen, modify the format with various options of padding, color, condition, etc. Tips: you should choose a specific order in the “Sample order to show” dropdown list to view how it works on an order email.\n\nFor example, in this step, I viewed order 132. We can see that it displays a Tracking Information form for the hook.\n\nHow about the hook? I tried it by using a third-party plugin which is B2BKing.\n\nAfter activating the B2BKing plugin, WooCommerce allows me to add a new payment method which is Purchase Order. I go to WooCommerce > Setting to enable the Purchase Order payment method.\n\nFrom now on, any customer buying products from your store can choose the Purchase Order payment method. Once they choose this method, they will be attached a Purchase Order Number.\n\nThe below image shows what customers will see on the checkout page.\n\nAnd how does this information displayed in the email template? This is when the hook will help. And below is the result.\n\nIt will automatically insert the Purchase Order Number which was created when that customer bought the products with the Purchase Order payment method.\n\nConclusion: The Power of WooCommerce Email Hooks and YayMail\n\nNowadays, more and more WooCommerce store owners can effectively run their e-commerce store without knowledge of coding thanks to the development of WordPress plugins.

As a token of appreciation, enjoy 10% off on your next order with the code: THANKYOU10.</p>'; }\n\nHere, the woocommerce_email_order_details action hook adds a thank-you message to the email order details. The order information and a discount code for the customer will appear below.\n\nThrough email filter hooks, you can change existing content. For instance, you can alter the email's subject line, adjust the footer, or modify any part of the email text before its dispatch.\n\nExample: Change the subject line of the \"New Order\" email sent to the admin.\n\nThe woocommerce_email_subject_new_order filter hook alters the \"New Order\" email's default subject line before sending it to the store admin.\n\nBoth action and filter hooks deliver powerful methods to personalize your store’s emails without changing the core code of WooCommerce!\n• Email-specific hooks: These are specific to individual WooCommerce emails, such as new order notifications, completed order emails, or canceled order emails.\n\nExample: After adding this woocommerce_email_after_order_table hook, you can add a custom message to the email after the order details table.\n\nadd_action( 'woocommerce_email_after_order_table', 'custom_message_after_order_table', 10, 4 ); function custom_message_after_order_table( $order, $sent_to_admin, $plain_text, $email ) { echo '<p>If you have any questions, feel free to contact us at [email protected].</p>'; }\n\nYou can see that a helpful message is placed after the order table to direct the customer to the support team.\n• Admin email hooks: These help you customize email notifications sent to the store administrator, such as new order alerts.\n\nExample: Let’s add this woocommerce_email_recipient_new_order hook to change or add recipients for the \"New Order\" email that is sent to admins.\n\nHere, the \"New Order\" email will be sent to both the admin and the warehouse team to ensure everyone is informed.\n• Customer email hooks: These are specific to customer-related emails, allowing you to modify emails like order confirmations, shipment notifications, or refund emails.\n\nExample: This hook woocommerce_email_footer will allow you to customize the footer text in WooCommerce emails sent to customers.\n\nadd_action( 'woocommerce_email_footer', 'custom_email_footer' ); function custom_email_footer() { echo '<p>Thank you for choosing our store. We hope to see you again!</p>'; }\n\nThis custom message “Thanking the customer” is added to the footer of every email. It reinforces a positive brand experience.\n\nUsing these email hooks can improve your email marketing strategy and provide a more personalized experience for your customers.\n\nUnderstanding how to implement them effectively will enhance engagement and drive better results in the long run.\n\nUsing WooCommerce custom email hooks enhances the customer experience and helps you better manage your store’s communication.\n\nHere are five reasons why they should be used:\n\nWith custom hooks, you can add personalized messages, promotional offers, or thank-you notes to your emails. This helps you connect better with your customers and make your emails more engaging.\n\nYou don’t need to edit the entire email template to make changes. Hooks lets you add or modify specific parts of the email, such as subject lines, footers, or order details, without touching the core files.\n\nHooks make it easier to customize emails without risking breaking your WooCommerce setup (if implemented perfectly). You can update or adjust your customizations quickly, all while keeping your store’s core intact.\n\nAction hooks allow you to automate tasks without requiring manual labor, such as including a discount coupon code in order confirmations or sending a follow-up email when order ships.\n\nCustom email hooks give you control over how your emails look and feel. This ensures that all the emails match your brand’s identity, creating a consistent customer experience.\n\nWooCommerce provides a variety of email hooks that allow developers to customize emails sent to customers and administrators.\n\nThese hooks help you modify email content, adjust recipients, or even add custom information to emails.\n\nBelow are 15 common WooCommerce email hooks and their usage:\n\nYou can use this hook to add content, such as a custom message or branding, to the top of the email.\n\nadd_action( 'woocommerce_email_header', 'custom_email_header_content' ); function custom_email_header_content( $email_heading ) { echo '<p>Welcome to our store! Here’s your order summary.</p>'; }\n\nEmail footers can have custom content with this hook.\n\nadd_action( 'woocommerce_email_footer', 'custom_email_footer_content' ); function custom_email_footer_content() { echo '<p>Thank you for shopping with us!</p>'; }\n\nIt adds text to an email before the order table.\n\nadd_action( 'woocommerce_email_before_order_table', 'add_custom_message_before_order_table', 10, 4 ); function add_custom_message_before_order_table( $order, $sent_to_admin, $plain_text, $email ) { echo '<p>Your order is being processed. Here are the details:</p>'; }\n\nIncreases the email's content after the order table.\n\nadd_action( 'woocommerce_email_after_order_table', 'custom_message_after_order_table', 10, 4 ); function custom_message_after_order_table( $order, $sent_to_admin, $plain_text, $email ) { echo '<p>If you have any questions, feel free to contact us.</p>'; }\n\nChanges the subject line of an email with the subject \"New Order.\"\n\nThis makes the email more personal by including the customer's name and contact information.\n\nMakes the order table have text added before the list of items that have been ordered.\n\nAfter the list of items that have been ordered, this command adds something to the order table.\n\nSets up the person who will receive the \"New Order\" email.\n\nCustomizes the recipient of the \"Processing Order\" email.\n\nModifies the order items table, allowing you to change how items are displayed.\n\nModifies the product name displayed in the email order item table.\n\nIt customizes the subject line of the \"processing order\" email.\n\nadd_filter( 'woocommerce_email_subject_processing_order', 'custom_processing_order_email_subject', 10, 2 ); function custom_processing_order_email_subject( $subject, $order ) { return 'Your Order is Being Processed: ' . $order->get_order_number(); }\n\nAdding default WooCommerce email hooks is a simple process. To do this, you have to use your theme’s functions.php file.\n\nBelow is a step-by-step guide on how to add default WooCommerce email hooks to customize various parts of the WooCommerce emails:\n• First, log in to your WordPress dashboard.\n• Open your theme’s functions.php file (or, if you’re using a child theme, open the child theme's functions.php file to avoid overwriting changes during theme updates).\n\n2. Add the hook you want to customize\n\nAfter accessing the functions.php file, you can add WooCommerce email hooks to modify email content.\n\nMethod 1: Suppose you want to add a custom message or branding at the top of WooCommerce emails.\n\nFor that, you can use the woocommerce_email_header hook. It will add a message to every WooCommerce email just below the header.\n\nadd_action( 'woocommerce_email_header', 'custom_email_header_content' ); function custom_email_header_content( $email_heading ) { echo '<p>Thank you for choosing our store! We value your business.</p>'; }\n\nMethod 2: Let’s consider another example. Suppose you want to include customer-specific details, like their email address, in the order confirmation email.\n\nYou need to use the woocommerce_email_customer_details hook. This hook adds the customer's email address below the order details in the email.\n\nYou can remove the hooks using the same process you used to add them. This is particularly useful if you wish to prevent a specific hook from functioning in your WooCommerce email.\n\nLet’s see how to do it:\n• Log in to your WordPress dashboard.\n• Open the functions.php file of your theme, or preferably your child's theme, to prevent any issues during theme updates.\n\nTo remove a WooCommerce hook, you’ll use the remove_action() or remove_filter() function, depending on whether the hook is an action or a filter. Below are examples of how to remove different types of WooCommerce email hooks.\n\nMethod 1: Let's say you wish to eliminate the content that the default email header hook (woocommerce_email_header) has added. For instance, you need to use the remove_action() function.\n\nThis will remove the default header content from all WooCommerce emails. It will also leave the header blank or allow you to replace it with custom content.\n\nMethod 2: Remove the order details in an email\n\nIf you want to remove the order details table, which lists the purchased items, use the woocommerce_email_order_details hook.\n\nIt will remove the table that displays the list of products ordered in WooCommerce emails.\n\nSkip WooCommerce Email Hooks: Here’s a Simple Way to Create Custom Emails Without Any Coding\n\nThe above examples show how to add custom texts to WooCommerce emails using hooks.\n\nHowever, this might feel overwhelming if you're uncomfortable working with custom code or adding snippets to your WordPress site.\n\nEven if you understand the process, it can still be time-consuming, and you may not have the flexibility to make complex customizations like automating email sequences based on customer behavior.\n\nHiring a professional developer for minor changes or customizations can also be costly.\n\nBut don’t worry!

Test on a staging site before going live\n\nBefore implementing email hooks on your live store, test them on a staging environment.\n\nThis will help you catch errors or conflicts without affecting your live customers. Testing ensures that the emails behave exactly as intended.\n\nIn case you add multiple hooks, keeping your code well-organized and simple to understand is essential.

        "document": "Do you want to make WooCommerce emails more personal and engaging for customers?\n\nWooCommerce email hooks allow you to customize and enhance every email your store sends.\n\nWhether it’s an order confirmation or a shipping update, these hooks simplify modifying content, adding personalized touches, or triggering additional actions—without editing the core WooCommerce files.\n\nIn this guide, we'll explain how WooCommerce email hooks work and how to use them to make your emails stand out.\n\nFurther, we’ll show you an alternative way to design beautiful emails with just a few simple clicks—without coding.\n\nWooCommerce email hooks enable you to personalize and customize your email to customers easily.\n\nWhether it's an order confirmation, a shipping update, or any other kind of notification, these hooks give you control over what’s included in the emails and how they look.\n\nLet’s get a better understanding of their types and use cases below!\n\nThere are two types of email hooks\n\nLet’s go through these actions and filter hooks in detail.\n\nIt lets you add extra content or trigger actions at specific points in the email.\n\nFor example, you can use an action hook to automatically include a thank-you message or a discount code in order confirmation emails.\n\nExample: Including a thank-you message in the order confirmation email\n\nadd_action( 'woocommerce_email_order_details', 'add_custom_thank_you_message', 20, 4 ); function add_custom_thank_you_message( $order, $sent_to_admin, $plain_text, $email ) { echo '<p>Thank you for your purchase! As a token of appreciation, enjoy 10% off on your next order with the code: THANKYOU10.</p>'; }\n\nHere, the woocommerce_email_order_details action hook adds a thank-you message to the email order details. The order information and a discount code for the customer will appear below.\n\nThrough email filter hooks, you can change existing content. For instance, you can alter the email's subject line, adjust the footer, or modify any part of the email text before its dispatch.\n\nExample: Change the subject line of the \"New Order\" email sent to the admin.\n\nThe woocommerce_email_subject_new_order filter hook alters the \"New Order\" email's default subject line before sending it to the store admin.\n\nBoth action and filter hooks deliver powerful methods to personalize your store’s emails without changing the core code of WooCommerce!\n• Email-specific hooks: These are specific to individual WooCommerce emails, such as new order notifications, completed order emails, or canceled order emails.\n\nExample: After adding this woocommerce_email_after_order_table hook, you can add a custom message to the email after the order details table.\n\nadd_action( 'woocommerce_email_after_order_table', 'custom_message_after_order_table', 10, 4 ); function custom_message_after_order_table( $order, $sent_to_admin, $plain_text, $email ) { echo '<p>If you have any questions, feel free to contact us at [email protected].</p>'; }\n\nYou can see that a helpful message is placed after the order table to direct the customer to the support team.\n• Admin email hooks: These help you customize email notifications sent to the store administrator, such as new order alerts.\n\nExample: Let’s add this woocommerce_email_recipient_new_order hook to change or add recipients for the \"New Order\" email that is sent to admins.\n\nHere, the \"New Order\" email will be sent to both the admin and the warehouse team to ensure everyone is informed.\n• Customer email hooks: These are specific to customer-related emails, allowing you to modify emails like order confirmations, shipment notifications, or refund emails.\n\nExample: This hook woocommerce_email_footer will allow you to customize the footer text in WooCommerce emails sent to customers.\n\nadd_action( 'woocommerce_email_footer', 'custom_email_footer' ); function custom_email_footer() { echo '<p>Thank you for choosing our store. We hope to see you again!</p>'; }\n\nThis custom message “Thanking the customer” is added to the footer of every email. It reinforces a positive brand experience.\n\nUsing these email hooks can improve your email marketing strategy and provide a more personalized experience for your customers.\n\nUnderstanding how to implement them effectively will enhance engagement and drive better results in the long run.\n\nUsing WooCommerce custom email hooks enhances the customer experience and helps you better manage your store’s communication.\n\nHere are five reasons why they should be used:\n\nWith custom hooks, you can add personalized messages, promotional offers, or thank-you notes to your emails. This helps you connect better with your customers and make your emails more engaging.\n\nYou don’t need to edit the entire email template to make changes. Hooks lets you add or modify specific parts of the email, such as subject lines, footers, or order details, without touching the core files.\n\nHooks make it easier to customize emails without risking breaking your WooCommerce setup (if implemented perfectly). You can update or adjust your customizations quickly, all while keeping your store’s core intact.\n\nAction hooks allow you to automate tasks without requiring manual labor, such as including a discount coupon code in order confirmations or sending a follow-up email when order ships.\n\nCustom email hooks give you control over how your emails look and feel. This ensures that all the emails match your brand’s identity, creating a consistent customer experience.\n\nWooCommerce provides a variety of email hooks that allow developers to customize emails sent to customers and administrators.\n\nThese hooks help you modify email content, adjust recipients, or even add custom information to emails.\n\nBelow are 15 common WooCommerce email hooks and their usage:\n\nYou can use this hook to add content, such as a custom message or branding, to the top of the email.\n\nadd_action( 'woocommerce_email_header', 'custom_email_header_content' ); function custom_email_header_content( $email_heading ) { echo '<p>Welcome to our store! Here’s your order summary.</p>'; }\n\nEmail footers can have custom content with this hook.\n\nadd_action( 'woocommerce_email_footer', 'custom_email_footer_content' ); function custom_email_footer_content() { echo '<p>Thank you for shopping with us!</p>'; }\n\nIt adds text to an email before the order table.\n\nadd_action( 'woocommerce_email_before_order_table', 'add_custom_message_before_order_table', 10, 4 ); function add_custom_message_before_order_table( $order, $sent_to_admin, $plain_text, $email ) { echo '<p>Your order is being processed. Here are the details:</p>'; }\n\nIncreases the email's content after the order table.\n\nadd_action( 'woocommerce_email_after_order_table', 'custom_message_after_order_table', 10, 4 ); function custom_message_after_order_table( $order, $sent_to_admin, $plain_text, $email ) { echo '<p>If you have any questions, feel free to contact us.</p>'; }\n\nChanges the subject line of an email with the subject \"New Order.\"\n\nThis makes the email more personal by including the customer's name and contact information.\n\nMakes the order table have text added before the list of items that have been ordered.\n\nAfter the list of items that have been ordered, this command adds something to the order table.\n\nSets up the person who will receive the \"New Order\" email.\n\nCustomizes the recipient of the \"Processing Order\" email.\n\nModifies the order items table, allowing you to change how items are displayed.\n\nModifies the product name displayed in the email order item table.\n\nIt customizes the subject line of the \"processing order\" email.\n\nadd_filter( 'woocommerce_email_subject_processing_order', 'custom_processing_order_email_subject', 10, 2 ); function custom_processing_order_email_subject( $subject, $order ) { return 'Your Order is Being Processed: ' . $order->get_order_number(); }\n\nAdding default WooCommerce email hooks is a simple process. To do this, you have to use your theme’s functions.php file.\n\nBelow is a step-by-step guide on how to add default WooCommerce email hooks to customize various parts of the WooCommerce emails:\n• First, log in to your WordPress dashboard.\n• Open your theme’s functions.php file (or, if you’re using a child theme, open the child theme's functions.php file to avoid overwriting changes during theme updates).\n\n2. Add the hook you want to customize\n\nAfter accessing the functions.php file, you can add WooCommerce email hooks to modify email content.\n\nMethod 1: Suppose you want to add a custom message or branding at the top of WooCommerce emails.\n\nFor that, you can use the woocommerce_email_header hook. It will add a message to every WooCommerce email just below the header.\n\nadd_action( 'woocommerce_email_header', 'custom_email_header_content' ); function custom_email_header_content( $email_heading ) { echo '<p>Thank you for choosing our store! We value your business.</p>'; }\n\nMethod 2: Let’s consider another example. Suppose you want to include customer-specific details, like their email address, in the order confirmation email.\n\nYou need to use the woocommerce_email_customer_details hook. This hook adds the customer's email address below the order details in the email.\n\nYou can remove the hooks using the same process you used to add them. This is particularly useful if you wish to prevent a specific hook from functioning in your WooCommerce email.\n\nLet’s see how to do it:\n• Log in to your WordPress dashboard.\n• Open the functions.php file of your theme, or preferably your child's theme, to prevent any issues during theme updates.\n\nTo remove a WooCommerce hook, you’ll use the remove_action() or remove_filter() function, depending on whether the hook is an action or a filter. Below are examples of how to remove different types of WooCommerce email hooks.\n\nMethod 1: Let's say you wish to eliminate the content that the default email header hook (woocommerce_email_header) has added. For instance, you need to use the remove_action() function.\n\nThis will remove the default header content from all WooCommerce emails. It will also leave the header blank or allow you to replace it with custom content.\n\nMethod 2: Remove the order details in an email\n\nIf you want to remove the order details table, which lists the purchased items, use the woocommerce_email_order_details hook.\n\nIt will remove the table that displays the list of products ordered in WooCommerce emails.\n\nSkip WooCommerce Email Hooks: Here’s a Simple Way to Create Custom Emails Without Any Coding\n\nThe above examples show how to add custom texts to WooCommerce emails using hooks.\n\nHowever, this might feel overwhelming if you're uncomfortable working with custom code or adding snippets to your WordPress site.\n\nEven if you understand the process, it can still be time-consuming, and you may not have the flexibility to make complex customizations like automating email sequences based on customer behavior.\n\nHiring a professional developer for minor changes or customizations can also be costly.\n\nBut don’t worry!

        "document": "Hooks, actions and filters are powerful tools that allow you to modify and extend the capabilities of your WooCommerce site without altering the core code. This document will give you a brief overview of these and an example of how to apply them to your WooCommerce site.\n\nNote: This document is meant to serve as a helpful guide for advanced troubleshooting; however, the procedures described are beyond the scope of our support policy and we cannot provide direct assistance with implementing them. \n\n\n\nIf you would like to seek assistance from a qualified WordPress/WooCommerce developer, we highly recommend Codeable or a Woo Agency Partner.\n\nHooks are a broad category that encompasses both actions and filters.\n\nThey provide a way for your code to interact with WordPress by ‘hooking into’ the underlying processes of the platform. Hooks are the points to which you attach your custom code.\n\nHere’s an example of a hook used in WooCommerce:\n• Purpose: This action hook executes after an order is completed on the WooCommerce checkout page.\n• Example Usage: If you want to perform an action right after a customer completes a purchase, like sending a custom order confirmation message, you could hook a function to .\n\nIn this example, is triggered by the hook and executes your custom code using the order ID provided by WooCommerce.\n\nActions are a specific type of hook. When you hook a function to an action, that function executes at a specific point in the WordPress execution cycle or when a specific event occurs.\n\nFor instance, you might use an action to send a welcome email when a new user registers on your site. Actions are about doing something extra or different at the time the action hook runs.\n\nHere’s another simple example of using an action hook in WooCommerce:\n• Purpose: This action hook executes just before the shopping cart contents display on the WooCommerce cart page.\n• Example Usage: If you want to add a custom message or notification at the top of the cart page, you could use this action hook.\n\nThis snippet attaches the function to the hook, which outputs a custom message to users at the beginning of the cart page.\n\nFilters are another type of hook, focused on modifying data. When data passes through a filter, all functions attached to the filter hook process it before returning or displaying it.\n\nThis allows you to change outputs or values, such as customizing how you display product prices, modify titles, or alterithe default text of buttons. Filters modify or adjust data rather than triggering additional actions.\n• Purpose: This filter allows you to customize the sale badge text that appears on products when they are on sale.\n• Example Usage: If you want to change the text of the sale badge on product listings to something more specific, like “Limited Offer,” you can use this filter.\n\nIn this example, the function is hooked to the filter to replace the default “Sale!” badge with “Limited Offer” on all products that are on sale. This allows for a simple customization that directly targets customer attention during promotional periods.\n\nAdding custom actions and filters to your WooCommerce site requires an advanced knowledge of WooCommerce, hooks and PHP. You can refer to our developer documentation on adding actions and filters for further information on this topic.\n\nIf you need to further customize your site or extend its functionality, we highly recommend Codeable, or a Certified WooExpert.\n\nDo you still have questions and need assistance?\n• Get in touch with a Happiness Engineer via our Help Desk. We provide support for extensions developed by and/or sold on WooCommerce.com, and Jetpack/WordPress.com customers.\n• If you are not a customer, we recommend finding help in the WooCommerce support forum or hiring a Woo Agency Partner. These are trusted agencies with a proven track record of building highly customized, scalable online stores. Learn more about Woo Agency Partners."

        "document": "One of the great plusses of WooCommerce is the amount of thought the developers have put into customising almost every aspect of its functions. When customising the notification emails that are sent out with a new order or completed order etc., there are several approaches to take:\n• WooCommerce Settings – simple control of appearance such as font colour and footer text can be accessed in WooCommerce > Settings > Emails > Email Options. However, these will apply to all notification emails, and do not offer fine-grained control.\n• Template Overrides – much more sophisticated customisation of each email’s appearance is possible by copying the relevant email template from woocommerce/templates/emails/ to yourtheme/woocommerce/emails/ – you can do this from the back-end in WooCommerce > Settings > Emails > <email name>. The theme email template will now be used in place of the standard template, and can be customised to your heart’s content.\n• Hooks and Filters – WooCommerce provides a wide range of hooks and filters to customise almost every aspect of the notification emails, which is useful if you want to have some programmatic control of the emails – for example, sending different new order emails to registered customers and guest checkouts. The WooCommerce documentation of these is pretty minimal so I’ve fleshed it out below:\n\n\n\n $this->id can have the following values:\n\nFor example, to change the email heading of new order emails, use:\n\nadd_filter( 'woocommerce_email_style_inline_tags', array( $this, 'style_inline_tags' ) );\n\n add_filter( 'woocommerce_email_style_inline_h1_tag', array( $this, 'style_inline_h1_tag' ) );\n\n add_filter( 'woocommerce_email_style_inline_h2_tag', array( $this, 'style_inline_h2_tag' ) );\n\n add_filter( 'woocommerce_email_style_inline_h3_tag', array( $this, 'style_inline_h3_tag' ) );\n\n add_filter( 'woocommerce_email_style_inline_a_tag', array( $this, 'style_inline_a_tag' ) );\n\n add_filter( 'woocommerce_email_style_inline_img_tag', array( $this, 'style_inline_img_tag' ) );\n\nCustomise the admin new order email subject for registered customers only:\n\nCustomise the admin new order email recipient to redirect to different departments for registered customers and guest checkouts:"

        "document": "For details on what the action hooks and filters do, reference the WooCommerce Hooks Reference.\n\nHooks in WordPress essentially allow you to change or add code without editing core files. They are used extensively throughout WordPress and WooCommerce and are very useful for developers.There are two types of hook: actions and filters.\n• Action Hooks allow you to insert custom code at various points (wherever the hook is run).\n• Filter Hooks allow you to manipulate and return a variable which it passes (for instance a product price).\n\nNote: This is a Developer level documentation. We are unable to provide support for customizations under our Support Policy. If you are unfamiliar with code/templates and resolving potential conflicts, select a WooExpert or Developer for assistance.\n\nIf you use a hook to add or manipulate code, you can add your custom code in a variety of ways:\n• Using a plugin such as Code Snippets.\n\nTo execute your own code, you hook in by using the action hook . Here is where to place your code:\n\nFilter hooks are called throughout are code using . To manipulate the passed variable, you can do something like the following:\n\nWith filters, you must return a value.\n\nTo learn more about options for using hooks and filters see our Snippet doc section.\n\nIn the example below, both action hooks and filter hooks are used. This tutorial teaches you how to change and add fields to the checkout.\n• Actions are used to:\n• Add a new field to the checkout\n• Add that new field to the order\n• Filters are used to:\n• Override the labels and placeholders of existing fields\n• Make an existing field optional while it used to be required\n\nFor a comprehensive view of the WooCommerce API, see the API Documentation."
