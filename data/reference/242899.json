        "document": "Description: Autocomplete enables users to quickly find and select from a pre-populated list of values as they type, leveraging searching and filtering.\n\nAny field that can receive input can be converted into an Autocomplete, namely, elements, elements, and elements with the attribute. When typing in the autocomplete field, the plugin starts searching for entries that match and displays a list of values to choose from. By entering more characters, the user can filter down the list to better matches. This can be used to choose previously selected values, such as entering tags for articles or entering email addresses from an address book. Autocomplete can also be used to populate associated information, such as entering a city name and getting the zip code. You can pull data in from a local or remote source: Local is good for small data sets, e.g., an address book with 50 entries; remote is necessary for big data sets, such as a database with hundreds or millions of entries to select from. To find out more about customizing the data source, see the documentation for the option. When the menu is open, the following key commands are available:\n• : Move focus to the previous item. If on first item, move focus to the input. If on the input, move focus to last item.\n• : Move focus to the next item. If on last item, move focus to the input. If on the input, move focus to the first item.\n• : Select the currently focused item and close the menu.\n• : Select the currently focused item, close the menu, and move focus to the next focusable element.\n• / : Scroll through a page of items (based on height of menu). It's generally a bad idea to display so many items that users need to page. When the menu is closed, the following key commands are available:\n• / : Open the menu, if the has been met. The autocomplete widget uses the jQuery UI CSS framework to style its look and feel. If autocomplete specific styling is needed, the following CSS class names can be used for overrides or as keys for the option:\n• : The menu used to display matches to the user.\n• : The input element that the autocomplete widget was instantiated with. While requesting data to display to the user, the class is also added to this element.\n\nWhich element the menu should be appended to. When the value is , the parents of the input field will be checked for a class of . If an element with the class is found, the menu will be appended to that element. Regardless of the value, if no element is found, the menu will be appended to the body. Note: The option should not be changed while the suggestions menu is open. Code examples: Initialize the autocomplete with the option specified: Get or set the option, after initialization: If set to the first item will automatically be focused when the menu is shown. Code examples: Initialize the autocomplete with the option specified: Get or set the option, after initialization: Specify additional classes to add to the widget's elements. Any of classes specified in the Theming section can be used as keys to override their value. To learn more about this option, check out the learn article about the option. Code examples: Initialize the autocomplete with the option specified, changing the theming for the class: Get or set a property of the option, after initialization, here reading and changing the theming for the class: The delay in milliseconds between when a keystroke occurs and when a search is performed. A zero-delay makes sense for local data (more responsive), but can produce a lot of load for remote data, while being less responsive. Code examples: Initialize the autocomplete with the option specified: Get or set the option, after initialization: Disables the autocomplete if set to . Code examples: Initialize the autocomplete with the option specified: Get or set the option, after initialization: The minimum number of characters a user must type before a search is performed. Zero is useful for local data with just a few items, but a higher value should be used when a single character search could match a few thousand items. Code examples: Initialize the autocomplete with the option specified: Get or set the option, after initialization: Default: { my: \"left top\", at: \"left bottom\", collision: \"none\" } option defaults to the input element, but you can specify another element to position against. You can refer to the Identifies the position of the suggestions menu in relation to the associated input element. Theoption defaults to the input element, but you can specify another element to position against. You can refer to the jQuery UI Position utility for more details about the various options. Code examples: Initialize the autocomplete with the option specified: Get or set the option, after initialization: Default: none; must be specified Defines the data to use, must be specified. Independent of the variant you use, the label is always treated as text. If you want the label to be treated as html you can use Scott González' html extension. The demos all focus on different variations of the option - look for one that matches your use case, and check out the code. Multiple types supported:\n• Array: An array can be used for local data. There are two supported formats:\n• An array of objects with and properties: The label property is displayed in the suggestion menu. The value will be inserted into the input element when a user selects an item. If just one property is specified, it will be used for both, e.g., if you provide only properties, the value will also be used as the label.\n• String: When a string is used, the Autocomplete plugin expects that string to point to a URL resource that will return JSON data. It can be on the same host or on a different one (must support CORS). The Autocomplete plugin does not filter the results, instead a query string is added with a field, which the server-side script should use for filtering the results. For example, if the option is set to and the user types , a GET request would be made to . The data itself can be in the same format as the local data described above.\n• Function: The third variation, a callback, provides the most flexibility and can be used to connect any data source to Autocomplete, including JSONP. The callback gets two arguments:\n• A object, with a single property, which refers to the value currently in the text input. For example, if the user enters in a city field, the Autocomplete term will equal .\n• A callback, which expects a single argument: the data to suggest to the user. This data should be filtered based on the provided term, and can be in any of the formats described above for simple local data. It's important when providing a custom source callback to handle errors during the request. You must always call the callback even if you encounter an error. This ensures that the widget always has the correct state. When filtering data locally, you can make use of the built-in function. It'll take a single string argument and escape all regex characters, making the result safe to pass to . Code examples: Initialize the autocomplete with the option specified: Get or set the option, after initialization:\n\nCloses the Autocomplete menu. Useful in combination with the method, to close the open menu.\n• None This method does not accept any arguments. Removes the autocomplete functionality completely. This will return the element back to its pre-init state.\n• None This method does not accept any arguments.\n• None This method does not accept any arguments.\n• None This method does not accept any arguments. Retrieves the autocomplete's instance object. If the element does not have an associated instance, is returned. Unlike other widget methods, is safe to call on any element after the autocomplete plugin has loaded.\n• None This method does not accept any arguments. Gets the value currently associated with the specified . Note: For options that have objects as their value, you can get the value of a specific key by using dot notation. For example, would get the value of the property on the option.\n• The name of the option to get. Gets an object containing key/value pairs representing the current autocomplete options hash.\n• None This signature does not accept any arguments. Sets the value of the autocomplete option associated with the specified . Note: For options that have objects as their value, you can set the value of just one property by using dot notation for . For example, would update only the property of the option.\n• The name of the option to set.\n• A value to set for the option. Sets one or more options for the autocomplete. to display all items. Triggers a event and invokes the data source if the event is not canceled. Can be used by a selectbox-like button to open the suggestions when clicked. When invoked with no parameters, the current input's value is used. Can be called with an empty string andto display all items. Returns a object containing the menu element. Although the menu items are constantly created and destroyed, the menu element itself is created during initialization and is constantly reused.\n• None This method does not accept any arguments.\n\nThe autocomplete widget is built with the widget factory and can be extended. When extending widgets, you have the ability to override or add to the behavior of existing methods. The following methods are provided as extension points with the same API stability as the plugin methods listed above. For more information on widget extensions, see Extending Widgets with the Widget Factory. Method that controls the creation of each option in the widget's menu. The method must create a new element, append it to the menu, and return it. See the Menu documentation for more details about the markup.\n• The element that the newly created element must be appended to.\n• \n• The string to display for the item.\n• The value to insert into the input when the item is selected. Code examples: Add the item's value as a data attribute on the . and an array of items that match the user typed term. Creation of the individual elements should be delegated to , which in turn delegates to the Method that controls building the widget's menu. The method is passed an emptyand an array of items that match the user typed term. Creation of the individualelements should be delegated to, which in turn delegates to the extension point.\n• An empty element to use as the widget's menu.\n• An Array of items that match the user typed term. Each item is an Object with and properties. Code examples: Add a CSS class name to the odd menu items. Method responsible for sizing the menu before it is displayed. The menu element is available at .\n• None This method does not accept any arguments. Code examples: Always display the menu as 500 pixels wide.\n\nTriggered when the field is blurred, if the value has changed.\n• \n• The item selected from the menu, if any. Otherwise the property is . Code examples: Initialize the autocomplete with the change callback specified: Bind an event listener to the autocompletechange event: Triggered when the menu is hidden. Not every event will be accompanied by a event. Note: The object is empty but included for consistency with other events. Code examples: Initialize the autocomplete with the close callback specified: Bind an event listener to the autocompleteclose event: Triggered when the autocomplete is created. Note: The object is empty but included for consistency with other events. Code examples: Initialize the autocomplete with the create callback specified: Bind an event listener to the autocompletecreate event: Triggered when focus is moved to an item (not selecting). The default action is to replace the text field's value with the value of the focused item, though only if the event was triggered by a keyboard interaction. Canceling this event prevents the value from being updated, but does not prevent the menu item from being focused. Code examples: Initialize the autocomplete with the focus callback specified: Bind an event listener to the autocompletefocus event: Triggered when the suggestion menu is opened or updated. Note: The object is empty but included for consistency with other events. Code examples: Initialize the autocomplete with the open callback specified: Bind an event listener to the autocompleteopen event: Triggered after a search completes, before the menu is shown. Useful for local manipulation of suggestion data, where a custom option callback is not required. This event is always triggered when a search completes, even if the menu will not be shown because there are no results or the Autocomplete is disabled.\n• \n• Contains the response data and can be modified to change the results that will be shown. This data is already normalized, so if you modify the data, make sure to include both and properties for each item. Code examples: Initialize the autocomplete with the response callback specified: Bind an event listener to the autocompleteresponse event: Triggered before a search is performed, after and are met. If canceled, then no request will be started and no items suggested. Note: The object is empty but included for consistency with other events. Code examples: Initialize the autocomplete with the search callback specified: Bind an event listener to the autocompletesearch event: Triggered when an item is selected from the menu. The default action is to replace the text field's value with the value of the selected item. Canceling this event prevents the value from being updated, but does not prevent the menu from closing.\n• \n• An Object with and properties for the selected option.

        "document": "Have you ever visited a website and noticed content overlayed on the web page? That’s an example of a modal on a website. They help you to direct user attention to a particular element or notification on your page.\n\nIf your website uses Bootstrap and you’d like to add this type of popup to your site, then you’ve come to the right place.\n\nIn this tutorial, we’ll explain what Bootstrap modal means and discuss some of the benefits of using it on your website. Then we’ll discuss the components of a modal and show you how to create Modals in Bootstrap. Let’s begin.\n\nA Bootstrap Modal is a lightweight, flexible, and responsive JavaScript popup or dialog box that is part of the Bootstrap framework. It is designed to overlay content on a website, creating a temporary and focused area for displaying additional information, forms, or interactive components without navigating to a new page.\n\nBenefits of Using Modals on Your Site\n\nThere are many benefits to using modals on a website. Below we’ll explain a few of them:\n• None User Engagement: Modals can capture users’ attention by presenting important information or interactive elements in a visually appealing way.\n• None Space Efficiency: Modals allow you to display additional content without cluttering the main page. This is especially beneficial for forms, login boxes, or secondary information.\n• None Improved User Flow: Modals keep users within the context of the current page. This eliminates the need for them to navigate away and provides a smoother user experience.\n• None Responsive Design: Bootstrap Modals are designed to be responsive, ensuring that they adapt well to various screen sizes. This makes them suitable for mobile devices and desktops alike.\n\nSpeaking of responsive web design practice, PureCode provides customizable components to help you build responsive web pages faster. This reduces the time to build repetitive templates and lets you focus on defining the logic for your web application.\n\nBefore you get started, you’ll need basic HTML and CSS knowledge. You’ll also need to have some knowledge of how Bootstrap works. Please see the video below to learn about using Bootstrap for web development.\n\nThere are 2 ways to add Bootstrap to a web project: Downloading the necessary files from https://getbootstrap.com/ and adding them to your project’s directory. Alternatively, you can use CDN (Content Delivery Network) to quickly add Bootstrap to your project.\n\nFor this tutorial, we’ll use the CDN method. To do so, you’ll need to add the Bootstrap CSS bundle to your HTML template. Copy and paste the code below to your HTML file. The code should be placed between the opening and closing <head> tag.\n\nAfter adding the CSS file, you’ll need to also include Bootstrap’s JS bundle. This package is essential as it includes some JavaScript functions required for components like the modal to work properly. The code should be placed just above the closing body tag (</body>) on your template.\n\nNow that we’ve added the necessary files for Bootstrap, let’s create a simple modal and explain each component.\n\nTo create a modal in Bootstrap, you need to set up 2 elements on your page. The first is the modal trigger element, which can be a button or an anchor link. The second element is the actual modal which comprises a header, body, footer, and other components like the close button. Here is an example of a basic implementation of a modal in Bootstrap.\n\nIn the code above:\n• None The modal is triggered by a button with the data-bs-toggle and data-bs-target attributes.\n• None The modal itself is represented by a div with the class modal. It has a unique ID (exampleModal) and includes three main sections: modal-dialog, modal-content, and the actual content inside the modal-body.\n• None The modal contains a title (modal-title), a close button (btn-close), content in the body, and optional footer buttons.\n• None The close button in the modal header has the attribute data-bs-dismiss=”modal”, which allows users to close the modal.\n\nThis example provides a basic template for creating a Bootstrap modal. Here is how it looks when you preview your webpage.\n\nA Bootstrap modal consists of several components that work together to create a popup dialog box. Below, we’ll explain each component along with the classes for each section:\n\n1. Modal Container (<div class=”modal”>): This is the outermost container that wraps all the modal components. It contains the modal’s ID, tabindex, and aria-labelledby/aria-hidden attributes.\n\n2. Modal Dialog (<div class=”modal-dialog”>): This represents the main dialog box within the modal. This section can have additional classes like modal-dialog-centered for centering the modal vertically.\n\n3. Modal Content (<div class=”modal-content”>): Contains the actual content of the modal, including the header, body, and footer. The content box is styled using Bootstrap classes.\n\n4. Modal Header (<div class=”modal-header”>): This section contains the title and an optional close button. The title is typically marked with the modal-title class. The close button can be added with the btn-close class and data-bs-dismiss=”modal” attribute.\n\n5. Modal Body (<div class=”modal-body”>): The modal body section holds the main content of the modal. You can add any HTML content or other Bootstrap components like tooltips and popovers.\n\n6. Modal Footer (<div class=”modal-footer”>): This section contains buttons or other elements that perform actions (e.g., Close, Save). It is styled using Bootstrap classes like btn for buttons.\n\n7. Trigger Button: The button or link that triggers the modal to open. It uses attributes like data-bs-toggle and data-bs-target to specify which modal to open.\n\nNow that we’ve learned the basics of setting up a modal in Bootstrap. Let’s cover some advanced concepts like changing modal sizes, centering, and scrollable modal examples.\n\nBootstrap provides options for different modal sizes to accommodate varying content. The modal-lg and modal-sm classes can be used for large and small modals, respectively.\n\nThese additional classes should be added next to the modal-dialog class. If you don’t specify a size class, the default modal size will be applied to the modal. Here is an example of a small and large modal.\n\nBelow is a table showing the available sizes Bootstrap supports along with their max width.\n\nAside from modifying the size of the modal, there are other modal variations you can implement to customize your popups. Modal variations in Bootstrap provide different ways to use and display modals, catering to various design and functionality needs. Here are some common modal variations:\n\nCentered Modal: To center a modal vertically, add the modal-dialog-centered class to the modal-dialog.\n\nScrollable Modal: When your modal content is long, making the modal scrollable is beneficial. To do so, use the modal-dialog-scrollable class. This ensures the modal content scrolls through the container without overflowing on the user’s viewport.\n\nFullscreen Modal: A fullscreen modal in Bootstrap is a type of modal dialog box that covers the entire screen. This can be particularly useful for ensuring that a user’s attention is focused on the content of the modal, such as forms, information, or interactive content. To make the modal fullscreen, add the modal-fullscreen class to the modal-dialog div.\n\nStatic Backdrop: Normally, clicking outside the modal closes it. But with a static backdrop (using data-bs-backdrop=”static”), clicking outside the modal won’t dismiss it. This is useful for modals where user interaction inside the modal is required.\n\nIf your page needs to handle multiple modals, ensure each modal has a unique ID. To prevent conflicts, set the data-bs-target attribute in your trigger buttons.\n\nRemember to ensure that each modal ID is unique. You can open and manage multiple modals using JavaScript/jQuery if needed.\n\nBootstrap provides a solid foundation for responsive modals out of the box. However, you might want to customize the appearance to match your specific design requirements. In this section, we’ll explore various aspects of styling and customization for Bootstrap modals.\n\nBootstrap allows you to customize modal styles using custom CSS or with Bootstrap’s utility classes. Here are some common customization options:\n\nBackground Color: This controls the background of the modal container. You can change the background color of the modal using the bg-* classes. For example:\n\nText Color: This controls the color of text elements in the modal HTML container. You can adjust the text color inside the modal using text-* classes. For example:\n\nBootstrap also allows you to customize the appearance of specific parts of the modal, such as the header, body, and footer, to match your design preferences. Bootstrap provides a set of utility classes and predefined styles that you can use for theming. Below, we’ll explain how to theme each component individually:\n\nCustomizing the modal header involves adjusting the background color, text color, and other styles. Here’s an example:\n\nIn this example, the bg-primary class sets the background color to the primary color, and text-white sets the text color to white.\n\nCustomizing the modal body allows you to style the content area. You can use custom classes or Bootstrap utility classes for styling. For example:\n\nIn this case, the custom-body class can be defined in your custom CSS to apply specific styles to the modal body.\n\nCustomizing the modal footer involves styling the buttons or any other content in the footer. Here’s an example:\n\nIn this example, the bg-dark class sets the background color to a dark shade, and text-white sets the text color to white.\n\nJavaScript events and callbacks play a crucial role in managing Bootstrap modals, enabling dynamic interactions and responses in web applications. Here’s an in-depth look at how these elements work.\n\nTo interact with a Bootstrap modal via JavaScript, you can use functions to open or close the modal, without the need for user interaction such as clicking a button.\n\nOpening a Modal Programmatically: To open a Bootstrap modal with JavaScript, you typically use the .modal(‘show’) method. Here’s an example:\n\nThis code selects the modal element by its ID and then calls the .modal(‘show’) method, which opens the modal.\n\nClosing a Modal Programmatically: Similarly, to close the modal, you use the .modal(‘hide’) method:\n\nBootstrap modals come with several events that allow you to run specific code in response to user interactions or modal state changes. These events include:\n• None show.bs.modal: This event fires immediately when the show instance method is called.\n• None shown.bs.modal: Fired when the modal has been made visible to the user.\n• None hide.bs.modal: This event is fired immediately when the hide instance method has been called.\n• None hidden.bs.modal: Fired when the modal has finished being hidden from the user.\n\nHere’s an example of how to use these events:\n\nIn this example, when the modal is completely shown, the message “Modal is fully shown” is logged to the console. Similarly, when the modal is completely hidden, “Modal is fully hidden” is logged.\n\nIf you’re using React for your web application, you can easily integrate Bootstrap using the react-bootstrap library. To do so, you’ll first need to install the React-bootstrap library to your project.\n\nThen, import Bootstrap’s CSS in your main JavaScript file (typically index.js or App.js):\n\nNow let’s create a functional component for our modal element. This component can accept props to control its visibility and content. For this example, we’ll name our component MyModal.js but you can use any name you like.\n\nWe can now import the new component we just created to our App.js file to create a modal. You’ll need to manage its visibility using state in the parent component. Here is the code to add to your App.js file.\n\nIn this example, modalShow is a state variable that determines whether the modal is shown or not. The handleClose and handleShow event handlers are used to update this state, effectively controlling the modal’s visibility.\n\nTo learn more about using modals in Bootstrap, check out the video below.\n\nTroubleshooting and resolving common issues in Bootstrap modals is crucial for ensuring a smooth user experience. Below, we’ll discuss some common issues you might encounter with Bootstrap modals, including their potential causes and solutions.\n\nThis issue can occur when a modal does not open or close as expected. The problem might be due to JavaScript errors, conflicts in event handling, or incorrect use of Bootstrap’s modal methods. Below are some of the common causes and solutions.\n• None JavaScript Errors: Check for JavaScript errors in the console. A JavaScript error elsewhere in your script can prevent the modal-related code from executing.\n• None Incorrect Selector or Typo: Ensure that the ID or class used in your jQuery selector matches the modal’s ID or class. // Make sure the selector matches the modal's ID $('#myModal').modal('show');\n• None Event Handling Conflicts: Make sure you’re not preventing the default action on buttons or links that trigger the modal. $('#myButton').on('click', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); // Make sure this isn't preventing the modal from opening $('#myModal').modal('show'); });\n\nStyling conflicts can occur when your CSS styles override or conflict with Bootstrap’s default modal styles. Here are some of the common causes and solutions.\n• None CSS Overrides: Ensure that your custom CSS does not unintentionally override modal styles. Use browser developer tools to inspect the modal elements and identify any overriding styles.\n• None Class Naming Conflicts: Avoid using common class names that might conflict with Bootstrap’s classes. You can prefix your class names with a unique identifier.\n\nZ-index issues arise when the modal is improperly layered in the document, causing it to appear behind other elements. Below are some of the common causes and solutions.\n• None Incorrect Z-index Values: Ensure that the modal’s z-index is higher than other page elements. You can increase it using custom CSS.\n• None Nested Elements: Avoid nesting modals within elements that have a lower z-index. Modals should typically be a direct child of the <body> tag.\n• None Stacked Modals: If using multiple modals, manage their z-index values carefully to ensure they layer correctly.\n\nWhen creating modals in Bootstrap, there are some tips to follow to ensure it looks and works properly. Here are a few things to consider.\n• None Use Semantic HTML: Ensure that your modal structure uses semantic HTML elements. Use appropriate heading tags (<h1>, <h2>) for titles and label elements for form controls to enhance accessibility.\n• None Keyboard Navigation: Test and ensure that users can navigate through the modal using a keyboard. All interactive elements within the modal should be accessible and focusable.\n• None ARIA Roles and Attributes: Leverage ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles and attributes to enhance the accessibility of your modal. For instance, use aria-labelledby to associate a label with the modal.\n• None Focus Management: Manage focus properly when the modal is opened and closed. Set the initial focus to the first interactive element within the modal and trap focus inside the modal to prevent users from tabbing outside of it.\n• None Test on Various Devices: Ensure that your modals are responsive by testing them on various devices and screen sizes. Bootstrap provides a responsive design by default, but custom styling or content may impact responsiveness.\n• None Media Queries: Utilize media queries in your custom styles if needed. Adjust the modal’s appearance or behavior based on the device width to provide an optimal user experience.\n• None Use Bootstrap Grid System: If your modal content requires a grid layout, use Bootstrap’s grid system for responsiveness. It automatically adjusts the layout based on the screen size.\n\nThese are answers to some of the top questions about creating modals in Bootstrap.\n\nYou can trigger a Bootstrap modal using JavaScript or data attributes.
