        "document": "Recently, while working on a progress bar, I realized that my approach could have been much simpler. I initially used in React to track the progress bar's position, assuming manual updates were necessary. However, CSS transitions elegantly handled the entire process without additional JavaScript overhead.\n\nHere’s what I learned, and how you can apply these techniques to your own projects.\n\nA CSS transition is a way to make changes to CSS properties over a specific duration. It’s great for animating incremental changes like a progress bar moving from one position to another.\n\nTransitions operate on the principle of smooth interpolation between a starting and ending state for a given property. To enable this, you simply specify:\n• The duration of the animation.\n• The timing function (optional) to control the easing.\n\nHere’s a minimal example of a progress bar using just CSS transitions:\n\nWhenever the property of changes, the transition ensures it happens smoothly over . You don’t need to manually track the previous state because the browser calculates the interpolation for you.\n\nHow I Over-Complicated It: Using\n\nIn my initial implementation, I used to store the progress bar’s previous state in React:\n\nWhile this worked, it was unnecessary. CSS transitions already track and animate changes in CSS properties automatically. By removing the and simply updating the dynamically, the transition worked flawlessly."

        "document": "HTML preprocessors can make writing HTML more powerful or convenient. For instance, Markdown is designed to be easier to write and read for text documents and you could write a loop in Pug. In CodePen, whatever you write in the HTML editor is what goes within the tags in a basic HTML5 template. So you don't have access to higher-up elements like the tag. If you want to add classes there that can affect the whole document, this is the place to do it. In CodePen, whatever you write in the HTML editor is what goes within the tags in a basic HTML5 template. If you need things in the of the document, put that code here. The resource you are linking to is using the 'http' protocol, which may not work when the browser is using https.\n\nCSS preprocessors help make authoring CSS easier. All of them offer things like variables and mixins to provide convenient abstractions. It's a common practice to apply CSS to a page that styles elements such that they are consistent across all browsers. We offer two of the most popular choices: normalize.css and a reset. Or, choose Neither and nothing will be applied. To get the best cross-browser support, it is a common practice to apply vendor prefixes to CSS properties and values that require them to work. For instance or . We offer two popular choices: Autoprefixer (which processes your CSS server-side) and -prefix-free (which applies prefixes via a script, client-side). Any URLs added here will be added as s in order, and before the CSS in the editor. You can use the CSS from another Pen by using its URL and the proper URL extension. You can apply CSS to your Pen from any stylesheet on the web. Just put a URL to it here and we'll apply it, in the order you have them, before the CSS in the Pen itself. You can also link to another Pen here (use the URL Extension) and we'll pull the CSS from that Pen and include it. If it's using a matching preprocessor, use the appropriate URL Extension and we'll combine the code before preprocessing, so you can use the linked Pen as a true dependency.\n\nJavaScript preprocessors can help make authoring JavaScript easier and more convenient. Any URL's added here will be added as s in order, and run before the JavaScript in the editor. You can use the URL of any other Pen and it will include the JavaScript from that Pen.

        "document": "I made some progress bars. They look like this:\n\nThey use no images, just CSS3 fancies. Like a good little designer always does, they fall back to totally acceptable experience. Here’s what they look like in Opera 11 which supports some of the CSS3 used here but not all.\n\nAs you might imagine, in browsers that support no CSS3 at all will look similar to the above, only even more simplified.\n\nUPDATE: It’s been a while. This article was originally written in 2011 and updated in 2015, and now again in 2021. This time I’m just making the demo and Pen and removing a lot of the vendor prefix stuff that isn’t needed anymore. Semantically, you’re probably better off looking at the and elements.\n\nThe bar itself will be a with a class of . Within that is a which acts as the “filled” area of the progress bar. This is set with an inline style. It’s the markup which will know how far to fill a progress bar, so this is a case where inline styles make perfect sense. The CSS alternative would be to create classes like “fill-10-percent”, “fill-one-third” or stuff like that, which is heavier and less flexible.\n\nThe div wrapper is the track of the progress bar. We won’t set a width, so it will stretch as wide as it’s parent as a block level element does. You could though. Height is also arbitrary. It’s set at 20px here but could be anything. We’ll round the corners in as many browsers as we can and set an inset shadow to give it a hair of depth.\n\nThen span inside will be the fill in part of the progress bar. We’ll make it display as a block with 100% height, so it stretches to fit whatever room it has. We’ll then use a bunch of CSS3 to give it gradient look and round it’s corners.\n\nLet’s make it as easy as possible to change the color. Just add a class name of “orange” or “red” to the div wrapper and the color will override.\n\nWe can get a cool striped effect by adding another element on top of that span and laying a repeated CSS3 gradient over it. Semantically this is best achieved with a pseudo element, so let’s do it that way. We’re going to absolutely position it over the exact area of the span (which already has relative positioning) and then round the corners the same so the stripes don’t stick out weird.\n\nI first saw and snagged this idea from Lea Verou.\n\nOnly Firefox 4 can animate pseudo elements, and only WebKit can do keyframe animations. So unfortunately we’re between a rock and a hardplace in terms of animating those stripes. If we’re set on it, let’s add an additional span and then WebKit animate that.\n\nThe span will be exactly the same as the pseudo element, so we’ll just use the same values…\n\nWe’ll move the background position as far as the size of it:\n\nMight as well leave the animation tied to the pseudo element too, so as soon as WebKit starts supporting that, it will work.\n\nUnfortunately you can’t animate to an auto or natural width, which might let us animate from a forced zero to the inline style.\n\nUpdate 1/25/2012: Turns out you CAN animate to an inline style. Just omit the “to” or “100%” ending value in the\n\nI’ve submitted it to major browsers bug trackers just to push it a long a little, but for now, unsupported. Instead, let’s do it with jQuery. Measure the original width, force it down to zero, then animate back up:\n\nDude my dude. HTML5 has features specifically for this. and ! Yep, it does, but here’s the rub. These elements have very specific appearance already applied to them. By default, they look like progress bars used elsewhere on the platform you are on. Like this on Mac:\n\nYou can turn off that default styling like this:\n\nThat’ll allow you to remove the glossly thing going on with that default styling, but it’s still pretty limited as to what you can do. You can change the progress bar inside like this:\n\n…and that’s fairly limited in what you can do with it afterward as well. To make things worse, things are very different across browsers, even between different WebKit browsers. Pseudo elements also work inconsistently. I hate to leave things hanging like this, but this is really a topic for another time. Suffice it to say, for these particular progress bars, the div/span thing is the ticket for now."

        "document": "The (Flexible Box) module (a W3C Candidate Recommendation as of October 2017) aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word “flex”). The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow. Most importantly, the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed to the regular layouts (block which is vertically-based and inline which is horizontally-based). While those work well for pages, they lack flexibility (no pun intended) to support large or complex applications (especially when it comes to orientation changing, resizing, stretching, shrinking, etc.). Note: Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of an application, and small-scale layouts, while the Grid layout is intended for larger scale layouts.\n\nSince flexbox is a whole module and not a single property, it involves a lot of things including its whole set of properties. Some of them are meant to be set on the container (parent element, known as “flex container”) whereas the others are meant to be set on the children (said “flex items”). If “regular” layout is based on both block and inline flow directions, the flex layout is based on “flex-flow directions”. Please have a look at this figure from the specification, explaining the main idea behind the flex layout. Items will be laid out following either the (from to ) or the cross axis (from to ).\n• main axis – The main axis of a flex container is the primary axis along which flex items are laid out. Beware, it is not necessarily horizontal; it depends on the property (see below).\n• main-start | main-end – The flex items are placed within the container starting from main-start and going to main-end.\n• main size – A flex item’s width or height, whichever is in the main dimension, is the item’s main size. The flex item’s main size property is either the ‘width’ or ‘height’ property, whichever is in the main dimension.\n• cross axis – The axis perpendicular to the main axis is called the cross axis. Its direction depends on the main axis direction.\n• cross-start | cross-end – Flex lines are filled with items and placed into the container starting on the cross-start side of the flex container and going toward the cross-end side.\n• cross size – The width or height of a flex item, whichever is in the cross dimension, is the item’s cross size. The cross size property is whichever of ‘width’ or ‘height’ that is in the cross dimension.\n\nThis defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the given value. It enables a flex context for all its direct children. Note that CSS columns have no effect on a flex container. \n\nThis establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container. Flexbox is (aside from optional wrapping) a single-direction layout concept. Think of flex items as primarily laying out either in horizontal rows or vertical columns.\n• (default): left to right in ; right to left in\n• : right to left in ; left to right in\n• : same as but top to bottom\n• : same as but bottom to top By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this property.\n• (default): all flex items will be on one line\n• : flex items will wrap onto multiple lines, from top to bottom.\n• : flex items will wrap onto multiple lines from bottom to top. There are some visual demos of here. This is a shorthand for the and properties, which together define the flex container’s main and cross axes. The default value is . \n\nThis defines the alignment along the main axis. It helps distribute extra free space leftover when either all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size. It also exerts some control over the alignment of items when they overflow the line.\n• (default): items are packed toward the start of the flex-direction.\n• : items are packed toward the end of the flex-direction.\n• : items are packed toward the start of the direction.\n• : items are packed toward the end of the direction.\n• : items are packed toward left edge of the container, unless that doesn’t make sense with the , then it behaves like .\n• : items are packed toward right edge of the container, unless that doesn’t make sense with the , then it behaves like .\n• : items are centered along the line\n• : items are evenly distributed in the line; first item is on the start line, last item on the end line\n• : items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around them. Note that visually the spaces aren’t equal, since all the items have equal space on both sides. The first item will have one unit of space against the container edge, but two units of space between the next item because that next item has its own spacing that applies.\n• : items are distributed so that the spacing between any two items (and the space to the edges) is equal. Note that that browser support for these values is nuanced. For example, never got support from some versions of Edge, and start/end/left/right aren’t in Chrome yet. MDN has detailed charts. The safest values are , , and . There are also two additional keywords you can pair with these values: and . Using ensures that however you do this type of positioning, you can’t push an element such that it renders off-screen (e.g. off the top) in such a way the content can’t be scrolled too (called “data loss”). \n\nThis defines the default behavior for how flex items are laid out along the cross axis on the current line. Think of it as the version for the cross-axis (perpendicular to the main-axis).\n• / / : items are placed at the start of the cross axis. The difference between these is subtle, and is about respecting the rules or the rules.\n• / / : items are placed at the end of the cross axis. The difference again is subtle and is about respecting rules vs. rules.\n• : items are centered in the cross-axis\n• : items are aligned such as their baselines align The and modifier keywords can be used in conjunction with all the rest of these keywords (although note browser support), and deal with helping you prevent aligning elements such that the content becomes inaccessible. \n\nThis aligns a flex container’s lines within when there is extra space in the cross-axis, similar to how aligns individual items within the main-axis. Note: This property only takes effect on multi-line flexible containers, where is set to either or ). A single-line flexible container (i.e. where is set to its default value, ) will not reflect .\n• (default): items are packed in their default position as if no value was set.\n• / : items packed to the start of the container. The (more supported) honors the while honors the direction.\n• / : items packed to the end of the container. The (more support) honors the while end honors the direction.\n• : items evenly distributed; the first line is at the start of the container while the last one is at the end\n• : items evenly distributed with equal space around each line\n• : items are evenly distributed with equal space around them\n• : lines stretch to take up the remaining space The and modifier keywords can be used in conjunction with all the rest of these keywords (although note browser support), and deal with helping you prevent aligning elements such that the content becomes inaccessible. The property explicitly controls the space between flex items. It applies that spacing only between items not on the outer edges. The behavior could be thought of as a minimum gutter, as if the gutter is bigger somehow (because of something like ) then the gap will only take effect if that space would end up smaller. It is not exclusively for flexbox, works in grid and multi-column layout as well. \n\nBy default, flex items are laid out in the source order. However, the property controls the order in which they appear in the flex container. Items with the same revert to source order. \n\nThis defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the item should take up. If all items have set to , the remaining space in the container will be distributed equally to all children. If one of the children has a value of , that child would take up twice as much of the space as either one of the others (or it will try, at least). This defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary. This defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed. It can be a length (e.g. 20%, 5rem, etc.) or a keyword. The keyword means “look at my width or height property” (which was temporarily done by the keyword until deprecated). The keyword means “size it based on the item’s content” – this keyword isn’t well supported yet, so it’s hard to test and harder to know what its brethren , , and do. If set to , the extra space around content isn’t factored in. If set to , the extra space is distributed based on its value. See this graphic. This is the shorthand for and combined. The second and third parameters ( and ) are optional. The default is , but if you set it with a single number value, like , that changes the to 0%, so it’s like setting . It is recommended that you use this shorthand property rather than set the individual properties. The shorthand sets the other values intelligently. \n\nThis allows the default alignment (or the one specified by ) to be overridden for individual flex items. Please see the explanation to understand the available values. Note that , and have no effect on a flex item.\n\nFlexbox requires some vendor prefixing to support the most browsers possible. It doesn’t just include prepending properties with the vendor prefix, but there are actually entirely different property and value names. This is because the Flexbox spec has changed over time, creating an “old”, “tweener”, and “new” versions. Perhaps the best way to handle this is to write in the new (and final) syntax and run your CSS through Autoprefixer, which handles the fallbacks very well. Alternatively, here’s a Sass to help with some of the prefixing, which also gives you an idea of what kind of things need to be done:\n\nLet’s start with a very very simple example, solving an almost daily problem: perfect centering. It couldn’t be any simpler if you use flexbox. .parent { display: flex; height: 300px; /* Or whatever */ } .child { width: 100px; /* Or whatever */ height: 100px; /* Or whatever */ margin: auto; /* Magic! */ } This relies on the fact a margin set to in a flex container absorb extra space. So setting a margin of will make the item perfectly centered in both axes. Now let’s use some more properties. Consider a list of 6 items, all with fixed dimensions, but can be auto-sized. We want them to be evenly distributed on the horizontal axis so that when we resize the browser, everything scales nicely, and without media queries. .flex-container { /* We first create a flex layout context */ display: flex; /* Then we define the flow direction and if we allow the items to wrap * Remember this is the same as: * flex-direction: row; * flex-wrap: wrap; */ flex-flow: row wrap; /* Then we define how is distributed the remaining space */ justify-content: space-around; } Done. Everything else is just some styling concern. Below is a pen featuring this example. Be sure to go to CodePen and try resizing your windows to see what happens. Let’s try something else. Imagine we have a right-aligned navigation element on the very top of our website, but we want it to be centered on medium-sized screens and single-columned on small devices. Easy enough. /* Large */ .navigation { display: flex; flex-flow: row wrap; /* This aligns items to the end line on main-axis */ justify-content: flex-end; } /* Medium screens */ @media all and (max-width: 800px) { .navigation { /* When on medium sized screens, we center it by evenly distributing empty space around items */ justify-content: space-around; } } /* Small screens */ @media all and (max-width: 500px) { .navigation { /* On small screens, we are no longer using row direction but column */ flex-direction: column; } } Let’s try something even better by playing with flex items flexibility! What about a mobile-first 3-columns layout with full-width header and footer. And independent from source order. .wrapper { display: flex; flex-flow: row wrap; } /* We tell all items to be 100% width, via flex-basis */ .wrapper > * { flex: 1 100%; } /* We rely on source order for mobile-first approach * in this case: * 1. header * 2. article * 3. aside 1 * 4. aside 2 * 5. footer */ /* Medium screens */ @media all and (min-width: 600px) { /* We tell both sidebars to share a row */ .aside { flex: 1 auto; } } /* Large screens */ @media all and (min-width: 800px) { /* We invert order of first sidebar and main * And tell the main element to take twice as much width as the other two sidebars */ .main { flex: 3 0px; } .aside-1 { order: 1; } .main { order: 2; } .aside-2 { order: 3; } .footer { order: 4; } }"

        "document": "With the prevalence of smartphones and increasingly easy-to-learn tools, there aren’t any excuses left for building desktop-only layouts. Whether you’re new to web development, updating your skills, or just trying to find an alternative to Bootstrap, modern CSS has everything you need to create responsive layouts.\n\nA text editor — I recommend VSCode, but Sublime, Atom, or any number of others will do the trick.\n\nA web browser — Chrome and Firefox are the correct options but any recent version of a major web browser will technically work\n\nSome basic understanding of HTML and CSS\n\nA GitHub account — Useful for accessing my template files and deploying your own site(s) through GitHub Pages\n\nTo get started, you’ll need a project folder with both an HTML file and a CSS file. The HTML file defines the page’s content and metadata, while the CSS dictates the styling of these elements. If you want to add some interactivity, you’ll need JavaScript as well, but that’s a lesson for another time.\n\nThis series relies mainly on two systems for creating layouts: CSS Grid and Flexbox. Both of these are built into CSS 3 and are supported by most modern browsers. Both systems are very flexible and can be used on their own to add structure to any webpage, but I’ve found they work best in tandem, and they each have their own strengths.\n\nIf you have a GitHub account (highly recommended), please feel free to fork and clone this repository where I have a template already set up for experimenting with CSS Grid and Flexbox. As you make changes, be sure to check how they look in your browser. As you can see, the unstyled HTML leaves something to be desired\n\nAt its core, CSS Grid allows developers to create a grid of any fixed or variable dimensions and position elements within that grid. To start, we need to select a parent element within which the grid will be created. I’ll be using a div of the class “wrapper” that I created to give us a bit more flexibility than if we set it up on the body itself. The CSS for this is:\n\nOh no! That’s much worse. It turns out that nine 100px by 100px squares weren’t enough for our content. Let’s take a second to clean this up a bit. Keeping the wrapper centered in the browser (margin: 0 auto;) and a bit away from the sides (width: 80%) will make it much easier to read.\n\nI’m also going to try to plan out my rows and columns better. My parents are accountants, so I have an unnatural fondness for spreadsheets anyway, but I actually think they are a great tool for this. As you can see, I’ve made a rough approximation of my row and column sizes, and I’ve even added some notation around the edges for easy reference (this will make more sense soon).\n\nNow we should have something along these lines:\n\nYou’ll notice I’m no longer defining all the rows and columns in terms of pixels. In general (and with many exceptions), it’s best to style most elements in relative (rather than absolute) terms so that they can adapt to different screen sizes. I’ve used three types of relative sizing in my new set-up. The width of the wrapper is set to 80% (of the screen width). Using “auto” as the size for a column or row will shrink that column or row to fit any content within it. This is very useful for rows which have unknown or variable height (like our lists of blog posts and projects above. Finally, I’ve set two column widths with “fr” units. These represent fractions, and they collectively fill any remaining space after absolute widths are accounted for while maintaining their proportions to one another. In this example, the middle 50px column will be subtracted from the wrapper width and the remaining width will be divided 2:1 between the left column (2fr) and the right column (1fr). As the window shrinks, the left and right columns will shrink but remain in proportion to one another, while the middle column will remain 50px wide no matter the screen width.\n\nThe page is less of a nightmare now, but the elements still aren’t where they belong. We’ll need to assign a position for each element manually. Fortunately, this is very easy with CSS Grid. There are two types of notation we can include in the CSS for each child element that will have the same result. It’s easiest to think of this notation in terms of the lines of the grid and the spaces in-between (rows and columns).\n\nI recommend learning one and using it consistently. I like the first version, but I have friends who prefer the second one. Using the excel template from before (with the notation indicating starting and ending lines for each row and column), the sections should be written as follows:\n\nWe’re not done yet, but at least our sections are in their respective boxes and the text is no longer overlapping. Check back next week as we clean the style up a bit and incorporate Flexbox to organize our nav links and series of blog excerpts."

        "document": "CSS Grid and Flexbox are powerful layout systems that revolutionize web design, allowing for complex, responsive layouts with ease. As of 2024, they remain essential tools for front-end developers, enabling them to create flexible, efficient, and visually appealing designs. This guide will delve into the details of CSS Grid and Flexbox, comparing their use cases, demonstrating practical examples, and providing actionable tips for mastering these technologies.\n\nCSS Grid and Flexbox offer different but complementary approaches to layout design. Understanding when and how to use each can significantly enhance your web development skills and improve the user experience on your websites.\n\nCSS Grid is a layout system designed to handle both rows and columns, making it a powerful tool for creating complex, two-dimensional layouts. Unlike traditional methods such as floats or positioning, CSS Grid allows you to define grid containers and grid items with precision. It simplifies the process of creating layouts that adapt to various screen sizes and orientations.\n\nThis code snippet sets up a container with three equal-width columns and a gap of 10px between each grid item. The function helps avoid repetitive code and makes your layout more manageable.\n\nCSS Grid excels in creating complex, nested layouts that require precise control over both rows and columns. It is highly adaptable, allowing you to specify fixed, fluid, or fractional units, which can respond dynamically to the screen size. This capability is particularly useful for creating grid-based designs that need to look good on a variety of devices.\n\nOne of the key benefits of CSS Grid is its ability to easily reorder items. For example, you can move items around without altering the HTML structure, purely by changing CSS properties:\n\nThis flexibility is beneficial for responsive design, where the order and placement of elements might need to change based on the viewport size.\n\nFlexbox, or the Flexible Box Layout, is a one-dimensional layout method for arranging items in rows or columns. It is particularly well-suited for distributing space within a container, aligning items, and managing their sizing and order. Flexbox simplifies tasks that are challenging with traditional CSS, such as vertical centering and equal-height columns.\n\nTo create a flex container, use the property:\n\nThis code sets up a flex container where items are spaced evenly with , and vertically centered with .\n\nFlexbox is designed for layout in one dimension, either a row or a column. It is highly efficient for aligning items, distributing space, and adjusting the sizes of items based on their content. Flexbox shines in scenarios where you need to align items within a container, manage spacing between items, or adjust item sizes dynamically.\n\nOne of the key strengths of Flexbox is its ability to align items along the main axis (horizontal or vertical) and the cross axis (the opposite direction). For example, you can center items both horizontally and vertically with just a few lines of CSS:\n\nThis simplicity makes Flexbox ideal for many common layout tasks, such as creating navigation bars, aligning form elements, or distributing space within a single row or column.\n\nWhen to Use CSS Grid\n\nCSS Grid is the go-to tool for creating complex, two-dimensional layouts. It is perfect for grid-based designs that require precise control over rows and columns. Use CSS Grid when you need to create layouts that involve overlapping elements, detailed alignment, or when your design requires complex nested grids.\n\nFor instance, CSS Grid is ideal for a layout like this:\n\nThis example demonstrates a typical web page layout with a header, a sidebar, a main content area, an advertisement section, and a footer. CSS Grid allows you to define this layout easily and make adjustments as needed.\n\nWhen to Use Flexbox\n\nFlexbox is best suited for simpler, one-dimensional layouts. It excels at distributing space within a container and aligning items, making it ideal for flexible and adaptive UI components. Use Flexbox for tasks like creating navigation bars, aligning form elements, or managing the layout of card components.\n\nFor example, a simple navigation bar can be created with Flexbox:\n\nThis code creates a responsive navigation bar with items spaced evenly and centered vertically, showcasing Flexbox’s strengths in managing space and alignment within a single dimension.\n\nCreating a responsive grid layout with CSS Grid involves using media queries to adjust the grid structure based on the viewport size. This approach ensures that your layout adapts to different screen sizes and orientations, providing an optimal user experience across devices.\n\nHere’s an example of a responsive grid layout:\n\nThis code sets up a grid container with four equal-width columns. When the viewport width is 1024px or less, the layout changes to two columns. For screens 600px or narrower, the layout adjusts to a single column. This responsive design ensures that the grid looks good on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.\n\nFlexbox is particularly useful for creating card layouts where each card should have the same height and width, regardless of their content. This is achieved by leveraging the flexibility and alignment properties of Flexbox.\n\nHere’s an example of a card layout using Flexbox:\n\nIn this layout, the is set to display its children using Flexbox. The property ensures that the cards wrap onto new lines as needed, while distributes the cards evenly with space around them. Each card takes up approximately one-third of the container’s width, minus the margin. This flexible layout ensures that the cards adjust their sizes dynamically, maintaining a consistent look across different screen sizes.\n\nWhile CSS Grid and Flexbox are powerful on their own, they can be combined to create even more versatile and responsive layouts. Using both layout systems together allows you to leverage the strengths of each, resulting in complex designs that are both flexible and maintainable.\n\nFor example, you can use CSS Grid to define the overall page structure and Flexbox for detailed alignment within grid items:\n\nIn this layout, CSS Grid defines the main structure with two columns, while Flexbox is used within the to center its children both vertically and horizontally.\n\nAdvanced CSS Grid and Flexbox techniques involve using functions like , , and , as well as properties like and . These techniques provide greater control over the layout and allow you to create highly responsive designs.\n\nFor instance, using and with CSS Grid:\n\nThis setup creates a responsive grid that automatically adjusts the number of columns based on the container’s width, ensuring that each column is at least 200px wide but can expand to fill available space. This approach is ideal for creating flexible, content-driven layouts that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes.\n\nOne of the powerful features of CSS Grid is the ability to name grid areas, making complex layouts easier to manage and more readable. Named grid areas allow you to define sections of your layout in a more semantic and intuitive way.\n\nHere’s an example of using named grid areas:\n\nIn this layout, the property defines the main structure of the grid using named areas. Each grid item is then assigned to a named area using the property. This approach makes the CSS more readable and the layout easier to maintain, especially in complex designs.\n\nCSS Grid allows for highly responsive layouts by using fractional units ( ) to allocate space within the grid. Fractional units are particularly useful for creating flexible and adaptive designs that can adjust seamlessly to different screen sizes.\n\nHere’s an example of a responsive layout using fractional units:\n\nIn this layout, the grid is divided into three columns, with the middle column taking up twice the space of the other two columns. This approach ensures that the layout remains flexible and adapts to the available screen space, making it ideal for responsive design.\n\nThe property in Flexbox allows you to rearrange items within a container without altering the HTML structure. This is particularly useful for responsive designs where the visual order of elements might need to change based on the screen size.\n\nHere’s an example of using the property:\n\nIn this layout, the visual order of the items is rearranged using the property, regardless of their position in the HTML. This flexibility allows you to create dynamic and responsive layouts with ease.\n\nFlexbox provides powerful alignment and justification options that allow you to control the spacing and alignment of items within a container. These properties include , , and .\n\nHere’s an example demonstrating these properties:\n\nIn this layout, distributes the items evenly within the container, with equal space around each item. vertically centers the items within the container. These properties make it easy to create well-aligned and spaced layouts, enhancing the overall user experience.\n\nCombining CSS Grid and Flexbox allows you to take advantage of the strengths of both layout systems. For example, you can use CSS Grid for the overall page structure and Flexbox for detailed alignment within grid items.\n\nHere’s an example of a layout that combines CSS Grid and Flexbox:\n\nIn this layout, CSS Grid defines the main structure with columns and rows. Within the and areas, Flexbox is used to manage the alignment and spacing of items. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both layout systems, resulting in a flexible and maintainable design.\n\nCombining CSS Grid and Flexbox also enables the creation of highly responsive nested layouts. For example, you can use CSS Grid for the overall structure and Flexbox within grid items to handle content that needs to be responsive.\n\nHere’s an example of a responsive nested layout:\n\nIn this layout, the uses CSS Grid to define two main columns. Within the , Flexbox manages the vertical alignment of content. The area uses CSS Grid to create a responsive grid of items that adjust their size based on the available space. This combination provides a robust and flexible layout that adapts to various screen sizes and content requirements.\n\nBest Practices for Using CSS Grid and Flexbox\n\nMaintaining clean, readable CSS is crucial for managing complex layouts. Use clear and consistent naming conventions for classes, and comment your CSS to explain non-obvious decisions or complex sections.\n\nBy using comments and clear class names, you make your CSS more understandable and easier to maintain, especially for large projects or when working in a team.\n\nPerformance is an important consideration when using CSS Grid and Flexbox. While both layout systems are powerful, overusing complex grid and flexbox properties can impact rendering performance, especially on lower-end devices.\n\nMinimize Layout Thrashing: Avoid making frequent changes to the DOM that can trigger reflows. Batch DOM updates to minimize reflow and repaint costs.\n\nUse Efficient Selectors: Ensure that your CSS selectors are efficient. Avoid deeply nested selectors and excessive combinators.\n\nOptimize for the Critical Rendering Path: Minimize the amount of CSS that needs to be processed during the initial page load. Inline critical CSS and load additional styles asynchronously.\n\nBy following these best practices, you can ensure that your layouts are not only flexible and responsive but also performant and user-friendly.\n\nCSS Grid and Flexbox are essential tools for modern web development, each offering unique strengths for creating responsive, flexible, and efficient layouts. By understanding when and how to use CSS Grid and Flexbox, you can enhance your web design capabilities and deliver a superior user experience across all devices.\n\nThis guide has covered the fundamentals, practical examples, and advanced techniques for using CSS Grid and Flexbox. By integrating these powerful layout systems into your projects, you can create sophisticated, adaptive designs that meet the demands of today’s diverse web environments.\n• How to Use Asynchronous Loading for Faster Websites\n• The Impact of Network Latency on Web Performance"

Each element of this layout has width 150px.\n\nThe code shown above works partially. The first row is ok, the second one no because the gold elements should stay aligned with the cards so when cards are on the right of el1, contents should below the cards. It is like if there were to be a hidden element (on the left side of contents) that has the same size as el1.\n\nAlso I would like everything to always be centered because now it is only if the window width is > 490px.\n\nThis is what I'd like to have:\n\nHow can I do that?"
