        "document": "A compiler is a special program that translates a programming language's source code into machine code, bytecode or another programming language. The source code is typically written in a high-level, human-readable language such as Java or C++. A programmer writes the source code in a code editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) that includes an editor, saving the source code to one or more text files. A compiler that supports the source programming language reads the files, analyzes the code, and translates it into a format suitable for the target platform.\n\nCompilers that translate source code to machine code target specific operating systems and computer architectures. This type of output is sometimes referred to as object code (which is not related to object-oriented programming). The outputted machine code is made up entirely of binary bits -- 1s and 0s -- so it can be read and executed by the processors on the target computers. For example, a compiler might output machine code for the Linux x64 platform or Linux ARM 64-bit platform.\n\nSome compilers can translate source code to bytecode instead machine code. Bytecode, which was first introduced in the Java programming language, is an intermediate language that can be executed on any system platform running a Java virtual machine (JVM) or bytecode interpreter. The JVM or interpreter converts the bytecode into instructions that can be executed by the hardware processor. A JVM also makes it possible for the bytecode to be recompiled by a just-in-time compiler. (See also: Java compiler)\n\nSome compilers can translate source code into another high-level programming language, rather than machine code or bytecode. This type of compiler might be referred to as a transpiler, transcompiler, source-to-source translator or it might go by another name. For example, a developer might use a transpiler to convert COBOL to Java.\n\nRegardless of the source language or the type of output, a compiler must ensure that the logic of the output code always matches that of the input code and that nothing is lost when converting the code. A compiler is, in the strictest sense, a translator and must ensure that the output is correct and preserves all the original logic."

        "document": "Computer program which translates code from one programming language to another\n\nIn computing, a compiler is a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another language (the target language). The name \"compiler\" is primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level programming language to a low-level programming language (e.g. assembly language, object code, or machine code) to create an executable program.[1][2]: p1 [3]\n\nThere are many different types of compilers which produce output in different useful forms. A cross-compiler produces code for a different CPU or operating system than the one on which the cross-compiler itself runs. A bootstrap compiler is often a temporary compiler, used for compiling a more permanent or better optimised compiler for a language.\n\nRelated software include decompilers, programs that translate from low-level languages to higher level ones; programs that translate between high-level languages, usually called source-to-source compilers or transpilers; language rewriters, usually programs that translate the form of expressions without a change of language; and compiler-compilers, compilers that produce compilers (or parts of them), often in a generic and reusable way so as to be able to produce many differing compilers.\n\nA compiler is likely to perform some or all of the following operations, often called phases: preprocessing, lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis (syntax-directed translation), conversion of input programs to an intermediate representation, code optimization and machine specific code generation. Compilers generally implement these phases as modular components, promoting efficient design and correctness of transformations of source input to target output. Program faults caused by incorrect compiler behavior can be very difficult to track down and work around; therefore, compiler implementers invest significant effort to ensure compiler correctness.[4]\n\nWith respect to making source code runnable, an interpreter provides a similar function as a compiler, but via a different mechanism. An interpreter executes code without converting it to machine code.[2]: p2 Some interpreters execute source code while others execute an intermediate form such as bytecode.\n\nA program compiled to native code tends to run faster than if interpreted. Environments with a bytecode intermediate form tend toward intermediate speed. Just-in-time compilation allows for native execution speed with a one-time startup processing time cost.\n\nLow-level programming languages, such as assembly and C, are typically compiled, especially when speed is a significant concern, rather than cross-platform support. For such languages, there are more one-to-one correspondences between the source code and the resulting machine code, making it easier for programmers to control the use of hardware.\n\nIn theory, a programming language can be used via either a compiler or an interpreter, but in practice, each language tends to be used with only one or the other. None-the-less, it is possible to write a compiler for a languages that is commonly interpreted. For example, Common Lisp can be compiled to Java bytecode (then interpreted by the Java virtual machine), C code (then compiled to native machine code), or directly to native code.\n\nTheoretical computing concepts developed by scientists, mathematicians, and engineers formed the basis of digital modern computing development during World War II. Primitive binary languages evolved because digital devices only understand ones and zeros and the circuit patterns in the underlying machine architecture. In the late 1940s, assembly languages were created to offer a more workable abstraction of the computer architectures.[5] Limited memory capacity of early computers led to substantial technical challenges when the first compilers were designed. Therefore, the compilation process needed to be divided into several small programs. The front end programs produce the analysis products used by the back end programs to generate target code. As computer technology provided more resources, compiler designs could align better with the compilation process.\n\nIt is usually more productive for a programmer to use a high-level language, so the development of high-level languages followed naturally from the capabilities offered by digital computers. High-level languages are formal languages that are strictly defined by their syntax and semantics which form the high-level language architecture. Elements of these formal languages include:\n• Language, any set of strings on an alphabet.\n\nThe sentences in a language may be defined by a set of rules called a grammar.[6]\n\nBackus–Naur form (BNF) describes the syntax of \"sentences\" of a language. It was developed by John Backus and used for the syntax of Algol 60.[7] The ideas derive from the context-free grammar concepts by linguist Noam Chomsky.[8] \"BNF and its extensions have become standard tools for describing the syntax of programming notations. In many cases, parts of compilers are generated automatically from a BNF description.\"[9]\n\nBetween 1942 and 1945, Konrad Zuse designed the first (algorithmic) programming language for computers called Plankalkül (\"Plan Calculus\"). Zuse also envisioned a Planfertigungsgerät (\"Plan assembly device\") to automatically translate the mathematical formulation of a program into machine-readable punched film stock.[10] While no actual implementation occurred until the 1970s, it presented concepts later seen in APL designed by Ken Iverson in the late 1950s.[11] APL is a language for mathematical computations.\n\nBetween 1949 and 1951, Heinz Rutishauser proposed Superplan, a high-level language and automatic translator.[12] His ideas were later refined by Friedrich L. Bauer and Klaus Samelson.[13]\n\nHigh-level language design during the formative years of digital computing provided useful programming tools for a variety of applications:\n• FORTRAN (Formula Translation) for engineering and science applications is considered to be one of the first actually implemented high-level languages and first optimizing compiler. 14 [ ]\n• COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) evolved from A-0 and FLOW-MATIC to become the dominant high-level language for business applications. 15\n\nCompiler technology evolved from the need for a strictly defined transformation of the high-level source program into a low-level target program for the digital computer. The compiler could be viewed as a front end to deal with the analysis of the source code and a back end to synthesize the analysis into the target code. Optimization between the front end and back end could produce more efficient target code.[17]\n\nSome early milestones in the development of compiler technology:\n• May 1952: Grace Hopper's team at Remington Rand wrote the compiler for the A-0 programming language (and coined the term compiler to describe it), 18 19 20 although the A-0 compiler functioned more as a loader or linker than the modern notion of a full compiler. 21 22 23\n• 1952, before September: An Autocode compiler developed by Alick Glennie for the Manchester Mark I computer at the University of Manchester is considered by some to be the first compiled programming language. 24\n• 1954–1957: A team led by John Backus at IBM developed FORTRAN which is usually considered the first high-level language. In 1957, they completed a FORTRAN compiler that is generally credited as having introduced the first unambiguously complete compiler. 25\n• 1959: The Conference on Data Systems Language (CODASYL) initiated development of COBOL. The COBOL design drew on A-0 and FLOW-MATIC. By the early 1960s COBOL was compiled on multiple architectures.\n• 1958–1960: Algol 58 was the precursor to ALGOL 60. It introduced code blocks, a key advance in the rise of structured programming. ALGOL 60 was the first language to implement nested function definitions with lexical scope. It included recursion. Its syntax was defined using BNF. ALGOL 60 inspired many languages that followed it. Tony Hoare remarked: \"... it was not only an improvement on its predecessors but also on nearly all its successors.\" 26 27\n• 1958–1962: John McCarthy at MIT designed LISP. 28 The symbol processing capabilities provided useful features for artificial intelligence research. In 1962, LISP 1.5 release noted some tools: an interpreter written by Stephen Russell and Daniel J. Edwards, a compiler and assembler written by Tim Hart and Mike Levin. 29\n\nEarly operating systems and software were written in assembly language. In the 1960s and early 1970s, the use of high-level languages for system programming was still controversial due to resource limitations. However, several research and industry efforts began the shift toward high-level systems programming languages, for example, BCPL, BLISS, B, and C.\n\nBCPL (Basic Combined Programming Language) designed in 1966 by Martin Richards at the University of Cambridge was originally developed as a compiler writing tool.[30] Several compilers have been implemented, Richards' book provides insights to the language and its compiler.[31] BCPL was not only an influential systems programming language that is still used in research[32] but also provided a basis for the design of B and C languages.\n\nBLISS (Basic Language for Implementation of System Software) was developed for a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-10 computer by W. A. Wulf's Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) research team. The CMU team went on to develop BLISS-11 compiler one year later in 1970.\n\nMultics (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service), a time-sharing operating system project, involved MIT, Bell Labs, General Electric (later Honeywell) and was led by Fernando Corbató from MIT.[33] Multics was written in the PL/I language developed by IBM and IBM User Group.[34] IBM's goal was to satisfy business, scientific, and systems programming requirements. There were other languages that could have been considered but PL/I offered the most complete solution even though it had not been implemented.[35] For the first few years of the Multics project, a subset of the language could be compiled to assembly language with the Early PL/I (EPL) compiler by Doug McIlory and Bob Morris from Bell Labs.[36] EPL supported the project until a boot-strapping compiler for the full PL/I could be developed.[37]\n\nBell Labs left the Multics project in 1969, and developed a system programming language B based on BCPL concepts, written by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson. Ritchie created a boot-strapping compiler for B and wrote Unics (Uniplexed Information and Computing Service) operating system for a PDP-7 in B. Unics eventually became spelled Unix.\n\nBell Labs started the development and expansion of C based on B and BCPL. The BCPL compiler had been transported to Multics by Bell Labs and BCPL was a preferred language at Bell Labs.[38] Initially, a front-end program to Bell Labs' B compiler was used while a C compiler was developed. In 1971, a new PDP-11 provided the resource to define extensions to B and rewrite the compiler. By 1973 the design of C language was essentially complete and the Unix kernel for a PDP-11 was rewritten in C. Steve Johnson started development of Portable C Compiler (PCC) to support retargeting of C compilers to new machines.[39][40]\n\nObject-oriented programming (OOP) offered some interesting possibilities for application development and maintenance. OOP concepts go further back but were part of LISP and Simula language science.[41] Bell Labs became interested in OOP with the development of C++.[42] C++ was first used in 1980 for systems programming. The initial design leveraged C language systems programming capabilities with Simula concepts. Object-oriented facilities were added in 1983.[43] The Cfront program implemented a C++ front-end for C84 language compiler. In subsequent years several C++ compilers were developed as C++ popularity grew.\n\nIn many application domains, the idea of using a higher-level language quickly caught on. Because of the expanding functionality supported by newer programming languages and the increasing complexity of computer architectures, compilers became more complex.\n\nDARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) sponsored a compiler project with Wulf's CMU research team in 1970. The Production Quality Compiler-Compiler PQCC design would produce a Production Quality Compiler (PQC) from formal definitions of source language and the target.[44] PQCC tried to extend the term compiler-compiler beyond the traditional meaning as a parser generator (e.g., Yacc) without much success. PQCC might more properly be referred to as a compiler generator.\n\nPQCC research into code generation process sought to build a truly automatic compiler-writing system. The effort discovered and designed the phase structure of the PQC. The BLISS-11 compiler provided the initial structure.[45] The phases included analyses (front end), intermediate translation to virtual machine (middle end), and translation to the target (back end). TCOL was developed for the PQCC research to handle language specific constructs in the intermediate representation.[46] Variations of TCOL supported various languages. The PQCC project investigated techniques of automated compiler construction. The design concepts proved useful in optimizing compilers and compilers for the (since 1995, object-oriented) programming language Ada.\n\nThe Ada STONEMAN document[a] formalized the program support environment (APSE) along with the kernel (KAPSE) and minimal (MAPSE). An Ada interpreter NYU/ED supported development and standardization efforts with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Standards Organization (ISO). Initial Ada compiler development by the U.S. Military Services included the compilers in a complete integrated design environment along the lines of the STONEMAN document. Army and Navy worked on the Ada Language System (ALS) project targeted to DEC/VAX architecture while the Air Force started on the Ada Integrated Environment (AIE) targeted to IBM 370 series. While the projects did not provide the desired results, they did contribute to the overall effort on Ada development.[47]\n\nOther Ada compiler efforts got underway in Britain at the University of York and in Germany at the University of Karlsruhe. In the U. S., Verdix (later acquired by Rational) delivered the Verdix Ada Development System (VADS) to the Army. VADS provided a set of development tools including a compiler. Unix/VADS could be hosted on a variety of Unix platforms such as DEC Ultrix and the Sun 3/60 Solaris targeted to Motorola 68020 in an Army CECOM evaluation.[48] There were soon many Ada compilers available that passed the Ada Validation tests. The Free Software Foundation GNU project developed the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) which provides a core capability to support multiple languages and targets. The Ada version GNAT is one of the most widely used Ada compilers. GNAT is free but there is also commercial support, for example, AdaCore, was founded in 1994 to provide commercial software solutions for Ada. GNAT Pro includes the GNU GCC based GNAT with a tool suite to provide an integrated development environment.\n\nHigh-level languages continued to drive compiler research and development. Focus areas included optimization and automatic code generation. Trends in programming languages and development environments influenced compiler technology. More compilers became included in language distributions (PERL, Java Development Kit) and as a component of an IDE (VADS, Eclipse, Ada Pro). The interrelationship and interdependence of technologies grew. The advent of web services promoted growth of web languages and scripting languages. Scripts trace back to the early days of Command Line Interfaces (CLI) where the user could enter commands to be executed by the system. User Shell concepts developed with languages to write shell programs. Early Windows designs offered a simple batch programming capability. The conventional transformation of these language used an interpreter. While not widely used, Bash and Batch compilers have been written. More recently sophisticated interpreted languages became part of the developers tool kit. Modern scripting languages include PHP, Python, Ruby and Lua. (Lua is widely used in game development.) All of these have interpreter and compiler support.[49]\n\n\"When the field of compiling began in the late 50s, its focus was limited to the translation of high-level language programs into machine code ... The compiler field is increasingly intertwined with other disciplines including computer architecture, programming languages, formal methods, software engineering, and computer security.\"[50] The \"Compiler Research: The Next 50 Years\" article noted the importance of object-oriented languages and Java. Security and parallel computing were cited among the future research targets.\n\nA compiler implements a formal transformation from a high-level source program to a low-level target program. Compiler design can define an end-to-end solution or tackle a defined subset that interfaces with other compilation tools e.g. preprocessors, assemblers, linkers. Design requirements include rigorously defined interfaces both internally between compiler components and externally between supporting toolsets.\n\nIn the early days, the approach taken to compiler design was directly affected by the complexity of the computer language to be processed, the experience of the person(s) designing it, and the resources available. Resource limitations led to the need to pass through the source code more than once.\n\nA compiler for a relatively simple language written by one person might be a single, monolithic piece of software. However, as the source language grows in complexity the design may be split into a number of interdependent phases. Separate phases provide design improvements that focus development on the functions in the compilation process.\n\nClassifying compilers by number of passes has its background in the hardware resource limitations of computers. Compiling involves performing much work and early computers did not have enough memory to contain one program that did all of this work. As a result, compilers were split up into smaller programs which each made a pass over the source (or some representation of it) performing some of the required analysis and translations.\n\nThe ability to compile in a single pass has classically been seen as a benefit because it simplifies the job of writing a compiler and one-pass compilers generally perform compilations faster than multi-pass compilers. Thus, partly driven by the resource limitations of early systems, many early languages were specifically designed so that they could be compiled in a single pass (e.g., Pascal).\n\nIn some cases, the design of a language feature may require a compiler to perform more than one pass over the source. For instance, consider a declaration appearing on line 20 of the source which affects the translation of a statement appearing on line 10. In this case, the first pass needs to gather information about declarations appearing after statements that they affect, with the actual translation happening during a subsequent pass.\n\nThe disadvantage of compiling in a single pass is that it is not possible to perform many of the sophisticated optimizations needed to generate high quality code. It can be difficult to count exactly how many passes an optimizing compiler makes. For instance, different phases of optimization may analyse one expression many times but only analyse another expression once.\n\nSplitting a compiler up into small programs is a technique used by researchers interested in producing provably correct compilers. Proving the correctness of a set of small programs often requires less effort than proving the correctness of a larger, single, equivalent program.\n\nRegardless of the exact number of phases in the compiler design, the phases can be assigned to one of three stages. The stages include a front end, a middle end, and a back end.\n• The front end scans the input and verifies syntax and semantics according to a specific source language. For statically typed languages it performs type checking by collecting type information. If the input program is syntactically incorrect or has a type error, it generates error and/or warning messages, usually identifying the location in the source code where the problem was detected; in some cases the actual error may be (much) earlier in the program. Aspects of the front end include lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and semantic analysis. The front end transforms the input program into an intermediate representation (IR) for further processing by the middle end. This IR is usually a lower-level representation of the program with respect to the source code.\n• The middle end performs optimizations on the IR that are independent of the CPU architecture being targeted. This source code/machine code independence is intended to enable generic optimizations to be shared between versions of the compiler supporting different languages and target processors. Examples of middle end optimizations are removal of useless (dead-code elimination) or unreachable code (reachability analysis), discovery and propagation of constant values (constant propagation), relocation of computation to a less frequently executed place (e.g., out of a loop), or specialization of computation based on the context, eventually producing the \"optimized\" IR that is used by the back end.\n• The back end takes the optimized IR from the middle end. It may perform more analysis, transformations and optimizations that are specific for the target CPU architecture. The back end generates the target-dependent assembly code, performing register allocation in the process. The back end performs instruction scheduling, which re-orders instructions to keep parallel execution units busy by filling delay slots. Although most optimization problems are NP-hard, heuristic techniques for solving them are well-developed and implemented in production-quality compilers. Typically the output of a back end is machine code specialized for a particular processor and operating system.\n\nThis front/middle/back-end approach makes it possible to combine front ends for different languages with back ends for different CPUs while sharing the optimizations of the middle end.[51] Practical examples of this approach are the GNU Compiler Collection, Clang (LLVM-based C/C++ compiler),[52] and the Amsterdam Compiler Kit, which have multiple front-ends, shared optimizations and multiple back-ends.\n\nThe front end analyzes the source code to build an internal representation of the program, called the intermediate representation (IR). It also manages the symbol table, a data structure mapping each symbol in the source code to associated information such as location, type and scope.\n\nWhile the frontend can be a single monolithic function or program, as in a scannerless parser, it was traditionally implemented and analyzed as several phases, which may execute sequentially or concurrently. This method is favored due to its modularity and separation of concerns. Most commonly, the frontend is broken into three phases: lexical analysis (also known as lexing or scanning), syntax analysis (also known as scanning or parsing), and semantic analysis. Lexing and parsing comprise the syntactic analysis (word syntax and phrase syntax, respectively), and in simple cases, these modules (the lexer and parser) can be automatically generated from a grammar for the language, though in more complex cases these require manual modification. The lexical grammar and phrase grammar are usually context-free grammars, which simplifies analysis significantly, with context-sensitivity handled at the semantic analysis phase. The semantic analysis phase is generally more complex and written by hand, but can be partially or fully automated using attribute grammars. These phases themselves can be further broken down: lexing as scanning and evaluating, and parsing as building a concrete syntax tree (CST, parse tree) and then transforming it into an abstract syntax tree (AST, syntax tree). In some cases additional phases are used, notably line reconstruction and preprocessing, but these are rare.\n\nThe main phases of the front end include the following:\n• converts the input character sequence to a canonical form ready for the parser. Languages which strop their keywords or allow arbitrary spaces within identifiers require this phase. The top-down, recursive-descent, table-driven parsers used in the 1960s typically read the source one character at a time and did not require a separate tokenizing phase. Atlas Autocode and Imp (and some implementations of ALGOL and Coral 66) are examples of stropped languages whose compilers would have a Line Reconstruction phase.\n• Preprocessing supports macro substitution and conditional compilation. Typically the preprocessing phase occurs before syntactic or semantic analysis; e.g. in the case of C, the preprocessor manipulates lexical tokens rather than syntactic forms. However, some languages such as Scheme support macro substitutions based on syntactic forms.\n• Lexical analysis (also known as lexing or tokenization) breaks the source code text into a sequence of small pieces called lexical tokens. 53 This phase can be divided into two stages: the scanning, which segments the input text into syntactic units called lexemes and assigns them a category; and the evaluating, which converts lexemes into a processed value. A token is a pair consisting of a token name and an optional token value. 54 Common token categories may include identifiers, keywords, separators, operators, literals and comments, although the set of token categories varies in different programming languages. The lexeme syntax is typically a regular language, so a finite-state automaton constructed from a regular expression can be used to recognize it. The software doing lexical analysis is called a lexical analyzer. This may not be a separate step—it can be combined with the parsing step in scannerless parsing, in which case parsing is done at the character level, not the token level.\n• Syntax analysis (also known as parsing) involves parsing the token sequence to identify the syntactic structure of the program. This phase typically builds a parse tree, which replaces the linear sequence of tokens with a tree structure built according to the rules of a formal grammar which define the language's syntax. The parse tree is often analyzed, augmented, and transformed by later phases in the compiler. 55\n• Semantic analysis adds semantic information to the parse tree and builds the symbol table. This phase performs semantic checks such as type checking (checking for type errors), or object binding (associating variable and function references with their definitions), or definite assignment (requiring all local variables to be initialized before use), rejecting incorrect programs or issuing warnings. Semantic analysis usually requires a complete parse tree, meaning that this phase logically follows the parsing phase, and logically precedes the code generation phase, though it is often possible to fold multiple phases into one pass over the code in a compiler implementation.\n\nThe middle end, also known as optimizer, performs optimizations on the intermediate representation in order to improve the performance and the quality of the produced machine code.[56] The middle end contains those optimizations that are independent of the CPU architecture being targeted.\n\nThe main phases of the middle end include the following:\n• Analysis: This is the gathering of program information from the intermediate representation derived from the input; data-flow analysis is used to build use-define chains, together with dependence analysis, alias analysis, pointer analysis, escape analysis, etc. Accurate analysis is the basis for any compiler optimization. The control-flow graph of every compiled function and the call graph of the program are usually also built during the analysis phase.\n• Optimization: the intermediate language representation is transformed into functionally equivalent but faster (or smaller) forms. Popular optimizations are inline expansion, dead-code elimination, constant propagation, loop transformation and even automatic parallelization.\n\nCompiler analysis is the prerequisite for any compiler optimization, and they tightly work together. For example, dependence analysis is crucial for loop transformation.\n\nThe scope of compiler analysis and optimizations vary greatly; their scope may range from operating within a basic block, to whole procedures, or even the whole program. There is a trade-off between the granularity of the optimizations and the cost of compilation. For example, peephole optimizations are fast to perform during compilation but only affect a small local fragment of the code, and can be performed independently of the context in which the code fragment appears. In contrast, interprocedural optimization requires more compilation time and memory space, but enable optimizations that are only possible by considering the behavior of multiple functions simultaneously.\n\nInterprocedural analysis and optimizations are common in modern commercial compilers from HP, IBM, SGI, Intel, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems. The free software GCC was criticized for a long time for lacking powerful interprocedural optimizations, but it is changing in this respect. Another open source compiler with full analysis and optimization infrastructure is Open64, which is used by many organizations for research and commercial purposes.\n\nDue to the extra time and space needed for compiler analysis and optimizations, some compilers skip them by default. Users have to use compilation options to explicitly tell the compiler which optimizations should be enabled.\n\nThe back end is responsible for the CPU architecture specific optimizations and for code generation[56].\n\nThe main phases of the back end include the following:\n• Machine dependent optimizations: optimizations that depend on the details of the CPU architecture that the compiler targets. 57 A prominent example is peephole optimizations, which rewrites short sequences of assembler instructions into more efficient instructions.\n• Code generation: the transformed intermediate language is translated into the output language, usually the native machine language of the system. This involves resource and storage decisions, such as deciding which variables to fit into registers and memory and the selection and scheduling of appropriate machine instructions along with their associated addressing modes (see also Sethi–Ullman algorithm). Debug data may also need to be generated to facilitate debugging.\n\nCompiler correctness is the branch of software engineering that deals with trying to show that a compiler behaves according to its language specification.[58] Techniques include developing the compiler using formal methods and using rigorous testing (often called compiler validation) on an existing compiler.\n\nHigher-level programming languages usually appear with a type of translation in mind: either designed as compiled language or interpreted language. However, in practice there is rarely anything about a language that requires it to be exclusively compiled or exclusively interpreted, although it is possible to design languages that rely on re-interpretation at run time. The categorization usually reflects the most popular or widespread implementations of a language – for instance, BASIC is sometimes called an interpreted language, and C a compiled one, despite the existence of BASIC compilers and C interpreters.\n\nInterpretation does not replace compilation completely. It only hides it from the user and makes it gradual. Even though an interpreter can itself be interpreted, a set of directly executed machine instructions is needed somewhere at the bottom of the execution stack (see machine language).\n\nFurthermore, for optimization compilers can contain interpreter functionality, and interpreters may include ahead of time compilation techniques. For example, where an expression can be executed during compilation and the results inserted into the output program, then it prevents it having to be recalculated each time the program runs, which can greatly speed up the final program. Modern trends toward just-in-time compilation and bytecode interpretation at times blur the traditional categorizations of compilers and interpreters even further.\n\nSome language specifications spell out that implementations must include a compilation facility; for example, Common Lisp. However, there is nothing inherent in the definition of Common Lisp that stops it from being interpreted. Other languages have features that are very easy to implement in an interpreter, but make writing a compiler much harder; for example, APL, SNOBOL4, and many scripting languages allow programs to construct arbitrary source code at runtime with regular string operations, and then execute that code by passing it to a special evaluation function. To implement these features in a compiled language, programs must usually be shipped with a runtime library that includes a version of the compiler itself.\n\nOne classification of compilers is by the platform on which their generated code executes. This is known as the target platform.\n\nA native or hosted compiler is one whose output is intended to directly run on the same type of computer and operating system that the compiler itself runs on. The output of a cross compiler is designed to run on a different platform. Cross compilers are often used when developing software for embedded systems that are not intended to support a software development environment.\n\nThe output of a compiler that produces code for a virtual machine (VM) may or may not be executed on the same platform as the compiler that produced it. For this reason, such compilers are not usually classified as native or cross compilers.\n\nThe lower level language that is the target of a compiler may itself be a high-level programming language. C, viewed by some as a sort of portable assembly language, is frequently the target language of such compilers. For example, Cfront, the original compiler for C++, used C as its target language. The C code generated by such a compiler is usually not intended to be readable and maintained by humans, so indent style and creating pretty C intermediate code are ignored. Some of the features of C that make it a good target language include the directive, which can be generated by the compiler to support debugging of the original source, and the wide platform support available with C compilers.\n\nWhile a common compiler type outputs machine code, there are many other types:\n• Source-to-source compilers are a type of compiler that takes a high-level language as its input and outputs a high-level language. For example, an automatic parallelizing compiler will frequently take in a high-level language program as an input and then transform the code and annotate it with parallel code annotations (e.g. OpenMP) or language constructs (e.g. Fortran's statements). Other terms for a source-to-source compiler are transcompiler or transpiler. 59\n• Bytecode compilers compile to assembly language of a theoretical machine, like some Prolog implementations\n• This Prolog machine is also known as the Warren Abstract Machine (or WAM).\n• Bytecode compilers for Java, Python are also examples of this category.\n• Just-in-time compilers (JIT compiler) defer compilation until runtime. JIT compilers exist for many modern languages including Python, JavaScript, Smalltalk, Java, Microsoft .NET's Common Intermediate Language (CIL) and others. A JIT compiler generally runs inside an interpreter. When the interpreter detects that a code path is \"hot\", meaning it is executed frequently, the JIT compiler will be invoked and compile the \"hot\" code for increased performance.\n• For some languages, such as Java, applications are first compiled using a bytecode compiler and delivered in a machine-independent intermediate representation. A bytecode interpreter executes the bytecode, but the JIT compiler will translate the bytecode to machine code when increased performance is necessary. 60 [ ]\n• Hardware compilers (also known as synthesis tools) are compilers whose input is a hardware description language and whose output is a description, in the form of a netlist or otherwise, of a hardware configuration.\n• The output of these compilers target computer hardware at a very low level, for example a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) or structured application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). 61 [ ] Such compilers are said to be hardware compilers, because the source code they compile effectively controls the final configuration of the hardware and how it operates. The output of the compilation is only an interconnection of transistors or lookup tables.\n• An example of hardware compiler is XST, the Xilinx Synthesis Tool used for configuring FPGAs. 62 [ ] Similar tools are available from Altera, 63 [ ] Synplicity, Synopsys and other hardware vendors.[ ]\n• A program that translates from a low-level language to a higher level one is a decompiler. 64\n• A program that translates into an object code format that is not supported on the compilation machine is called a cross compiler and is commonly used to prepare code for execution on embedded software applications. 65 [ ]\n• A program that rewrites object code back into the same type of object code while applying optimisations and transformations is a binary recompiler.\n\nAssemblers, which translate human readable assembly language to the machine code instructions executed by hardware, are not considered compilers.[66][b] (The inverse program that translates machine code to assembly language is called a disassembler.)\n• Basics of Compiler Design at the Wayback Machine (archived 15 May 2018)\n• on YouTube explaining the key conceptual difference between compilers and interpreters\n• Forum about compiler development at the Wayback Machine (archived 10 October 2014)"

        "document": "Compilers are an essential part of software development. Compilers allow developers to write programs in high-level languages that humans can understand, but then convert that high-level language into a form that only a machine can read.\n\nWhy Do We Use Compilers?\n\nProgrammers use compilers to translate high-level programming languages into machine code that computers can understand and execute.\n\nCompilers play a critical role in the development process because they help catch syntax and semantic errors before we run the code, which saves time and prevents crashes. Compilers also optimize the code for efficient execution and produce faster, more compact programs.\n\nMore From Built In’s Tech DictionaryWhat Is Source Code?\n\nA compiler analyzes the source code and breaks it down into individual instructions that the computer can understand. In other words, a compiler turns human-readable program code into zeroes and ones.\n\nFirst, the compiler performs a lexical analysis in which it breaks the source code down into a sequence of tokens that represent the individual elements of the program like keywords, operators and identifiers.\n\nNext, the compiler performs a syntactic analysis. In this phase, it checks the source code for any syntax errors and ensures that it follows the correct language-specific rules and conventions. If any errors occur, the compiler throws an error and stops the compilation.\n\nOnce the compiler has successfully parsed and checked the source code for errors, it runs low-level optimization on the code to improve its performance. This can involve reducing the amount of memory the program uses or optimizing the code for speed by rearranging instructions or eliminating unnecessary operations.\n\nFinally, the compiler generates the machine code that corresponds to the original source code. This machine code lives in a binary file that the computer’s hardware can execute directly.\n\nSomething to keep in mind here is that compilation makes the code platform-dependent. This means that compiled code produces a machine-readable and machine-specific executable file that only the particular type of machine is able to execute. This means that code compiled on a Windows machine won’t run on a Mac or Linux system without being recompiled.\n\nAnother core tool for running source code is called an interpreter. An interpreter executes source code directly line-by-line, without compiling it into machine code.\n\nBecause of the line-by-line interpretation, an interpreted program typically runs slower than compiled code. Also, an interpreted program doesn’t generate a machine code file like compilers do. This means you can’t run an interpreted program independent of the original program. Instead, you have to interpret the program from scratch.\n\nOn the other hand, an interpreted program shows potential coding errors line-by-line and one at a time during the interpretation process. This makes finding code errors easier. This is distinct from a compiler, which shows the errors all in one chunk after the compilation, so debugging is a much trickier process.\n\nIn programming terminology, it’s said that a programming language is either interpreted or compiled. This isn’t necessarily true. A coding language can have both interpreted and compiled implementations. For example, we usually consider Python an interpreted language, but there’s also a compiled implementation, Cython.\n\nMore on Python From Artturi JalliWhat Is the @ Symbol in Python and How Do I Use It?\n\nShould I Use a Compiler or an Interpreter?\n\nThe main implication of using an interpreted language like Python is that the code is executed line-by-line, which allows for faster development and easier debugging.\n\nHowever, interpreted code is generally slower and less efficient than compiled code. Using a compiled language like Cython results in faster code execution and improved performance but the development process is slower and more complex with less flexibility for debugging.\n\nIn the case of Python versus Cython, Cython allows for incorporating C code into Python, which results in faster execution times for performance-critical parts of the code, while still providing the benefits of a high-level interpreted language for other parts of the code."

        "document": "A compiler is software that translates or converts a program written in a high-level language (Source Language) into a low-level language (Machine Language or Assembly Language). Compiler design is the process of developing a compiler.\n\nThe development of compilers is closely tied to the evolution of programming languages and computer science itself. Here’s an overview of how compilers came into existence:\n\nIn the 1950s, Grace Hopper developed the first compiler, leading to languages like FORTRAN (1957), LISP (1958), and COBOL (1959). The 1960s saw innovations like ALGOL, and the 1970s introduced C and Pascal. Modern compilers focus on optimization, supporting object-oriented features and Just-in-Time compilation. Compilers have revolutionized programming, enabling complex systems and improving software efficiency.\n\nPlease refer History of Compilers for more details.\n\nA program written in a high-level language cannot run without compilation. Each programming language has its own compiler, but the fundamental tasks performed by all compilers remain the same. Translating source code into machine code involves multiple stages, such as lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, code generation, and optimization.\n\nWhile compilers are specialized, they differ from general translators. A translator or language processor is a tool that converts an input program written in one programming language into an equivalent program in another language.\n\nWe know a computer is a logical assembly of Software and Hardware. The hardware knows a language, that is hard for us to grasp, consequently, we tend to write programs in a high-level language, that is much less complicated for us to comprehend and maintain in our thoughts. Now, these programs go through a series of transformations so that they can readily be used by machines. This is where language procedure systems come in handy.\n• High-Level Language: If a program contains pre-processor directives such as #include or #define it is called HLL. They are closer to humans but far from machines. These (#) tags are called They direct the pre-processor about what to do.\n• Pre-Processor: The pre-processor removes all the #include directives by including the files called file inclusion and all the #define directives using macro expansion. It performs file inclusion, augmentation, macro-processing, etc. For example: Let in the source program, it is written #include “Stdio. h”. Pre-Processor replaces this file with its contents in the produced output.\n• Assembly Language: It’s neither in binary form nor high level. It is an intermediate state that is a combination of machine instructions and some other useful data needed for execution.\n• Assembler: For every platform (Hardware + OS) we will have an assembler. They are not universal since for each platform we have one. The output of the assembler is called an object file. Its translates assembly language to machine code.\n• Compiler: The compiler is an intelligent program as compared to an assembler. The compiler verifies all types of limits, ranges, errors, etc. Compiler program takes more time to run and it occupies a huge amount of memory space. The speed of the compiler is slower than other system software. It takes time because it enters through the program and then does the translation of the full program.\n• Interpreter: An interpreter converts high-level language into low-level machine language, just like a compiler. But they are different in the way they read the input. The Compiler in one go reads the inputs, does the processing, and executes the source code whereas the interpreter does the same line by line. A compiler scans the entire program and translates it as a whole into machine code translates the program one statement at a time. Interpreted programs are usually slower concerning compiled ones.\n• Relocatable Machine Code: It can be loaded at any point and can be run. The address within the program will be in such a way that it will cooperate with the program movement.\n• Loader/Linker: converts the relocatable code into absolute code and tries to run the program resulting in a running program or an error message (or sometimes both can happen). Linker loads a variety of object files into a single file to make it executable. Then loader loads it in memory and executes it.\n• Linker: The basic work of a linker is to merge object codes (that have not even been connected), produced by the compiler, assembler, standard library function, and operating system resources.\n• Loader: The codes generated by the compiler, assembler, and linker are generally re-located by their nature, which means to say, the starting location of these codes is not determined, which means they can be anywhere in the computer memory. Thus the basic task of loaders to find/calculate the exact address of these memory locations.\n\nOverall, compiler design is a complex process that involves multiple stages and requires a deep understanding of both the programming language and the target platform. A well-designed compiler can greatly improve the efficiency and performance of software programs, making them more useful and valuable for users.\n\nThere are two major phases of compilation, which in turn have many parts. Each of them takes input from the output of the previous level and works in a coordinated way.\n\nAn intermediate representation is created from the given source code :\n\nAn equivalent target program is created from the intermediate representation. It has two parts :\n\nRead more about Phases of Compiler, Here.\n\nCompiler construction tools are specialized software that help developers create compilers more efficiently. Here are the key tools:\n• Parser Generators: It creates syntax analyzers (parsers) based on grammatical descriptions of programming languages.\n• Scanner Generators: It produces lexical analyzers using regular expressions to define the tokens of a language.\n• Syntax-Directed Translation Engines: It generates intermediate code in three-address format from input comprising a parse tree.\n• Automatic Code Generators: It converts intermediate language into machine language using template matching techniques.\n• Data-Flow Analysis Engines: It supports code optimization by analyzing the flow of values throughout different parts of the program.\n• Compiler Construction Toolkits: It provides integrated routines to facilitate the construction of various compiler components.\n• Self Compiler: When the compiler runs on the same machine and produces machine code for the same machine on which it is running then it is called as self compiler or resident compiler.\n• Cross Compiler : The compiler may run on one machine and produce the machine codes for other computers then in that case it is called a cross-compiler. It is capable of creating code for a platform other than the one on which the compiler is running.\n• Source-to-Source Compiler: A Source-to-Source Compiler or transcompiler or transpiler is a compiler that translates source code written in one programming language into the source code of another programming language.\n• Single Pass Compiler: When all the phases of the compiler are present inside a single module, it is simply called a single-pass compiler. It performs the work of converting source code to machine code.\n• Two Pass Compiler: Two-pass compiler is a compiler in which the program is translated twice, once from the front end and the back from the back end known as Two Pass Compiler.\n• Multi-Pass Compiler: When several intermediate codes are created in a program and a syntax tree is processed many times, it is called Multi-Pass Compiler. It breaks codes into smaller programs.\n• Just-in-Time (JIT) Compiler: I t is a type of compiler that converts code into machine language during program execution, rather than before it runs. It combines the benefits of interpretation (real-time execution) and traditional compilation (faster execution).\n• Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compiler: It converts the entire source code into machine code before the program runs. This means the code is fully compiled during development, resulting in faster startup times and better performance at runtime.\n• Incremental Compiler: It compiles only the parts of the code that have changed, rather than recompiling the entire program. This makes the compilation process faster and more efficient, especially during development.\n\nThese are some operations that are done by the compiler.\n• None It enables the creation of symbol tables and intermediate representations.\n• None It helps in code compilation and error detection.\n• None it saves all codes and variables.\n• None It analyses the full program and translates it.\n• Efficiency: Compiled programs are generally more efficient than interpreted programs because the machine code produced by the compiler is optimized for the specific hardware platform on which it will run.\n• Portability: Once a program is compiled, the resulting machine code can be run on any computer or device that has the appropriate hardware and operating system, making it highly portable.\n• Error Checking: Compilers perform comprehensive error checking during the compilation process, which can help catch syntax, semantic, and logical errors in the code before it is run.\n• Optimizations: Compilers can make various optimizations to the generated machine code, such as eliminating redundant instructions or rearranging code for better performance.\n• Longer Development Time: Developing a compiler is a complex and time-consuming process that requires a deep understanding of both the programming language and the target hardware platform.\n• Debugging Difficulties: Debugging compiled code can be more difficult than debugging interpreted code because the generated machine code may not be easy to read or understand.\n• Lack of Interactivity: Compiled programs are typically less interactive than interpreted programs because they must be compiled before they can be run, which can slow down the development and testing process.\n• Platform-Specific Code: If the compiler is designed to generate machine code for a specific hardware platform, the resulting code may not be portable to other platforms.\n\nPracticing the following questions will help you test your knowledge. All questions have been asked in GATE in previous years or GATE Mock Tests. It is highly recommended that you practice them.\n\nWhy is it so important?\n\nWhat are the major stages?\n\nHow does a compiler differ from an interpreter?"

Prepare for the Eventualities!\"\n\nA compiler is a software designed to translate or convert source code into object code that can be understood by a machine.\n\nIn short, this software serves as a crucial bridge connecting programmers with the computer hardware.\n\nWith such software tools, high-level programming languages can be transformed into machine language, making it easier for computers to process. This process is commonly referred to as compilation.\n\nIn general, this software is responsible for assisting programmers in converting program code. However, it also serves several other functions, including:\n• Translating program code to enable it to run on different platforms.\n• Facilitating programmers in checking syntax errors in the source code of a program.\n• Assisting in optimizing the resulting code and machine instructions to enhance program performance.\n• Improving the speed of the compilation process by translating only the modified parts of the code (incremental technique).\n• Enhancing the of a program by validating the source code.\n\nAfter understanding what is a compiler and its functions, you may find that the concept is similar to something called an interpreter. However, both of them have quite significant differences, such as:\n• Definition: An interpreter is a program that helps interpret commands in a high-level language into a simpler language. On the other hand, a compiler is software that translates source code to make it understandable for the machine.\n• Commands: Commands in an interpreter are generally interpreted line by line. In contrast, commands in a compiler are translated simultaneously.\n• Linker: An interpreter does not require a linker, while a compiler needs a linker.\n• Program Code: A compiler can conceal the program code (e.g., Fortran, Cobol, Pascal, etc.). On the other hand, an interpreter cannot conceal the code (e.g., ASP, Perl, PHP).\n\nEssentially, the operation varies depending on the method used to analyze and convert the source code. However, regardless of the approach, here are some common stages you need to know:\n\nIn this stage, the compiling software is responsible for reading the source code, analyzing the data structure, and interpreting the meaning of the code. The stages include:\n• Lexical Analysis: It divides the source code into individual code fragments representing specific patterns. These code fragments are then prepared for further analysis in terms of syntax and semantics.\n• Syntax Analysis: It verifies the code's compliance with the rules of the programming language in the source code.\n• Semantic Analysis: It checks the validity, logic, and accuracy of the code. It also examines whether variables have been categorized into the appropriate types.\n\nAfter the analysis process is complete, the next phase is the synthesis phase. In this stage, this compiling software will generate two types of code: object code and intermediate code.\n• Intermediate Representation (IR) Generation: After the source code passes through the analysis phases mentioned above, it will then produce intermediate representation (IR), facilitating the translation of the source code into another format.\n• Code Optimizer: It runs this process by optimizing the IR code to be ratified as the final code. Note that some types also allow users to manually perform these optimizations.\n• Output Code Generation: This is the final stage where it produces the final code in the form of optimized IR code.\n\nUpon completion of the synthesis phase, the compiler then generates an executable file that can be directly run by the computer.\n\nIn general, this software can be categorized into four different types. They are:\n\nThis type can generate the latest version of specific software, making them widely used for improving and optimizing performance.\n\nThis type is suitable for developing cross-platform software as it can produce abstract code that can be used on different operating systems from the parent platform itself.\n\nTranscompilers can convert source code originating from a High-Level Language (HLL) into another programming language (non-machine code).\n\nDecompilers can convert machine code into program source code. This type is commonly used to support learning practices related to programming.\n\nOnce you understand what is a compiler, its functions, types, and how it works, it's essential to know which programming languages can utilize this software. Here are some of them:\n\nC++ is a programming language that allows developers to write code with a high level of control while maintaining flexibility. Some commonly used software for C++ are Visual C++ and GCC.\n\nJava also uses a compiler as part of its software development cycle. As one of the most popular and secure programming languages, Java employs specific software to transform program code into bytecode. Some compiler examples in Java are OpenJDK, IBM SDK, and Oracle JDK.\n\nVisual Basic is a programming language for rapid application development. When using Visual Basic, the source code is converted by the Visual Basic Compiler (VBC).\n\nThis programming language is commonly used for developing Android applications due to its object-oriented nature. Some suitable compiling software for Kotlin are Studio and the Kotlin Compiler.\n\nPascal is a suitable programming language for creating applications with a structural programming language. If you are using Pascal, the required software is the Pascal Compiler."

These instructions are machine code.\n\nHumans can read and write machine code, that’s what they did in the old days when software was much simpler, but it was still very tedious and error prone.\n\nTo make things easier for humans to read and write software, we made up a new language. This language is just a bunch of convenient shortcuts for writing down common phrases and connecting them with other phrases that are tedious and error prone to write in machine code.\n\nNow we read and write software in this convenient language.\n\nBut there are actually a lot of these convenient languages, and new ones are still being created, so it’s impractical for all machines to understand all these languages, so they just stick to machine code.\n\nThis means we need to translate from each convenient language to machine code. That’s why the instructions written in the convenient language are called “source code” — it’s the source of the machine code.\n\nTo prevent meaning from getting lost in translation, the translation process is designed to be literal and mechanical, unlike translating English to French.\n\nRemember that unlike the source code, the machine code is tedious and error prone to read and write. The fact that the machine code wasn’t really written thoughtfully but just mechanically translated from the source code makes it event harder to understand (for humans).\n\nSo if someone wants to read or change a piece of software for which the source code isn’t published, they have to read or change the machine code, which is impractically difficult.\n\nIf the source code of a piece of software is published, it’s suddenly much easier to understand, copy and change the software.\n\nSince source code can take years to write but no time at all to copy, it’s often kept secret."

        "document": "A computer program written in machine language is known as machine code. It makes use of a specific computer architecture’s instruction set. Binary is the most common format. The lowest level of software is machine code. Other programming languages are converted to machine code before being executed by the computer. The instruction performs the process. An opcode (operation code) and an operand make up each instruction. Memory addresses or data are often used as operands. An instruction set is a list of opcodes that a computer would use. Other programming languages and Assembly code are translated into machine code. Code is translated into another language or machine learning code by programmers. Native code is a term used to describe machine code.\n\nThe difference between bytecode and machine code is that the byte code comprises binary, hexadecimal, macro instructions and is not directly understood by the CPU. A virtual machine is intended to be effective, whereas Machine code consists of the CPU’s directly comprehensible binary instructions. The main difference between source code and machine code is that the source code is the programming of non-executable but standardized language code that is converted. In contrast, the machine code is the actual executable code.\n\nLet us take a byte that is 8 bits for a machine learning code example. How many patterns with 8 bits can we make? Only two options are available with 1 bit, 1, or 0. We have 2 bits with 4 patterns, and we can also arrange 256 bits with 8 bits. So what have they been doing? They met and met and decided on a code to make it a standard. They agreed. For example, take ASCII, the ‘01000001’ bit pattern represents the ‘A’ letter. We’ve only given a bit of a pattern meaning. But remember that the interpretation of these patterns is based on the context in which it is used.\n\nIn this article let us look at:\n\nHow to write machine code? Machine code can be written in various forms, such as :\n\nA few switches are used. This produces a 1 and 0 sequence. This was used in computing in the early days.\n\nUse of an editor for Hex. This allows opcodes to be used instead of the command number.\n\nThe assembler is used. Languages are easier to assemble than opcodes. Your syntax is easier than your computer’s language but more difficult than languages of a high level. The assembler translates source code from machine code alone.\n\nUsing a high-level programming language, programs can read and write code with ease. The programs are translated into the code of your computer. In several steps, the translation will occur—the first to optimise Java programmes in bytecode. The machine language is then translated when used.\n\nLet us see how to generate machine code? There are several types of instructions in a set usually:\n• Copying a value from one register to another: memory operations.\n• Activities comparing two values: larger than, lesser than, the same.\n• Combining operations: adding, comparing, and copying operations that are equivalent to some value, jumping into a certain point in the programme if a register is 0.\n• Converting data types: e.g., converting a floating-point value (a 32-bit to a 64-bit integrator) into an integer.\n• For some commands, many modern CPUs use microcode. More complex commands usually use it. Often this is done using CISC architectures.\n• Each family of processors has its own instruction set. Instructions are patterns of bits corresponding to the machine’s distinct commands. The instruction set is thus unique to a processor class that mostly uses the same architecture.\n• New designs also include all predecessor instructions and may add extra instructions. Sometimes newer designs stop or change the meaning of an instruction code, impacting the compatibility of code; even almost fully compatible processors may show some instructions with slightly different compliance but rarely presents a problem.\n• Other particulars, such as operating systems, memory arrangements, or peripheral devices, may also be different for systems. As a program is usually based on such factors, various systems usually don’t execute the same machine code even though they have the same processor type.\n• Most of them have one or more fields with opcode. The basic instruction type is specified. Other fields may specify the operand type, address mode, etc. Special instructions may also be included in the opcode itself. These instructions are immediately named.\n• In other ways, the designs of the processor may vary. Different instructions may vary in length. They will also be of the same thickness. All instructions of the same length can simplify the design.\n\nThis article has all the information you need to know about Machine code generation and how to find machine code.\n\nThere are no right or wrong ways of learning AI and ML technologies – the more, the better!
