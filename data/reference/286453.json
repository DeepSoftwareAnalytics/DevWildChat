Let us see the algorithm that prints all vertices without any source and the graph maybe disconnected. The algorithm is simple, instead of calling BFS for a single vertex, we call the above implemented BFS for all not yet visited vertices one by one.\n\n// Mark source node as visited and enqueue it // Get all adjacent vertices of the dequeued // vertex curr If an adjacent has not been // visited, mark it visited and enqueue it // Perform BFS for the entire graph which maybe // create an array to store the traversal // Initially mark all the vertices as not visited // Mark source node as visited and enqueue it // Get all adjacent vertices of the dequeued // vertex curr If an adjacent has not been // visited, mark it visited and enqueue it // Perform BFS for the entire graph which maybe // create an array to store the traversal // Initially mark all the vertices as not visited # Mark source node as visited and enqueue it # Get all adjacent vertices of the dequeued # vertex curr If an adjacent has not been # visited, mark it visited and enqueue it # Perform BFS for the entire graph which maybe # create an array to store the traversal # Initially mark all the vertices as not visited // Mark source node as visited and enqueue it // Get all adjacent vertices of the dequeued // vertex curr If an adjacent has not been // visited, mark it visited and enqueue it // Perform BFS for the entire graph which maybe // create an array to store the traversal // Initially mark all the vertices as not visited // Mark source node as visited and enqueue it // Get all adjacent vertices of the dequeued // vertex curr If an adjacent has not been // visited, mark it visited and enqueue it // Perform BFS for the entire graph which maybe // create an array to store the traversal // Initially mark all the vertices as not visited\n\nTime Complexity: O(V + E), BFS explores all the vertices and edges in the graph. In the worst case, it visits every vertex and edge once. Therefore, the time complexity of BFS is O(V + E), where V and E are the number of vertices and edges in the given graph. Auxiliary Space: O(V), BFS uses a queue to keep track of the vertices that need to be visited. In the worst case, the queue can contain all the vertices in the graph. Therefore, the space complexity of BFS is O(V).\n\nBFS has various applications in graph theory and computer science, including:\n• Shortest Path Finding: BFS can be used to find the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph. By keeping track of the parent of each node during the traversal, the shortest path can be reconstructed.\n• Cycle Detection: BFS can be used to detect cycles in a graph. If a node is visited twice during the traversal, it indicates the presence of a cycle.\n• Connected Components: BFS can be used to identify connected components in a graph. Each connected component is a set of nodes that can be reached from each other.\n• Topological Sorting: BFS can be used to perform topological sorting on a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Topological sorting arranges the nodes in a linear order such that for any edge (u, v), u appears before v in the order.\n• Level Order Traversal of Binary Trees: BFS can be used to perform a level order traversal of a binary tree.

        "document": "In this tutorial, we’ll discuss the knight’s shortest path problem on a chessboard. Furthermore, we’ll explain the problem statement and provide an efficient solution.\n\nGiven a standard chessboard, we want to find the minimum number of steps for a knight to reach a destination position from a source position . Here, the source and destination position of the knight on a chessboard is known.\n\nNow let’s take a look at the possible movements of a knight from a random position on a chessboard:\n\nOn a chessboard, a knight can move two ways. It can either move one square horizontally and two squares vertically, or one square vertically and two squares horizontally. Hence, from a given position (X, Y), the possible moves are:\n\nHere, we’ve shown the possible positions on a chessboard a knight can move from a given initial position. At any point in time, a knight can’t go out of the chessboard. Finally, if there is a situation that the knight can’t reach the destination from the given initial position, we’ll return .\n\nIn order to solve this problem, first, we’ll convert the chessboard to a knight’s graph:\n\nIn a knight’s graph, each box on a chessboard denotes a vertex. Each vertex corresponds to the position of a knight on a chessboard. Each edge represents a legal move of a knight. Hence, we can apply any searching algorithm to find the shortest path from one point to another in order to solve the knight’s shortest path problem. We’re using Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm here.\n\nInitially, we’ll position a knight randomly on a chessboard. From the initial point, we’ll aim to explore all possible positions. If all the possible positions which can be reached from the initial position are not visited, we enqueue this state into a queue. Moreover, we increase the number of moves by from the last state in the queue.\n\nAt each new position, we’ll check if the current position of the knight is the destination position or not. If the current position is not the destination, we’ll pop the current position from the queue and enqueue the possible positions a knight can move from the current position.\n\nWe’ll continue until we reach the destination position or explore all the possible positions on a chessboard.\n\nLet’s look at the pseudocode now:\n\nHere, and are two direction arrays that denote the change in the X-direction and the Y-direction. Furthermore, we created a queue and pushed the knight’s initial position .\n\nInitially, we created an array to decide whether a given position on a chessboard is already explored or not. In the beginning, we initialized it to in order to depict all the positions are unexplored. When we start the iteration, we make the knight’s initial position in the array as .\n\nMoreover, we used an array in order to store the number of steps required for a knight to reach the destination position. We run the algorithm until the queue is empty or the destination is reached.\n\nTo check whether a given position is inside the chessboard or not, function is defined. Here is the expansion of :\n\nFinally, let’s talk about the time complexity of the pseudocode. So the main complexity of this pseudocode is visiting the chessboard cells to reach the destination. If the dimension of the given chessboard is , the time complexity of this algorithm will be .\n\nIn this tutorial, we discussed the knight’s shortest path problem on a chessboard. We presented a BFS based approach for solving this problem with pseudocode."

        "document": "This chapter describes some things you’ve learned about already in more detail, and adds some new things as well.\n\nThe list data type has some more methods. Here are all of the methods of list objects: Add an item to the end of the list. Similar to . Extend the list by appending all the items from the iterable. Similar to . Insert an item at a given position. The first argument is the index of the element before which to insert, so inserts at the front of the list, and is equivalent to . Remove the first item from the list whose value is equal to x. It raises a if there is no such item. Remove the item at the given position in the list, and return it. If no index is specified, removes and returns the last item in the list. It raises an if the list is empty or the index is outside the list range. Remove all items from the list. Similar to . Return zero-based index in the list of the first item whose value is equal to x. Raises a if there is no such item. The optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in the slice notation and are used to limit the search to a particular subsequence of the list. The returned index is computed relative to the beginning of the full sequence rather than the start argument. Return the number of times x appears in the list. Sort the items of the list in place (the arguments can be used for sort customization, see for their explanation). Reverse the elements of the list in place. Return a shallow copy of the list. Similar to . An example that uses most of the list methods: You might have noticed that methods like , or that only modify the list have no return value printed – they return the default . This is a design principle for all mutable data structures in Python. Another thing you might notice is that not all data can be sorted or compared. For instance, doesn’t sort because integers can’t be compared to strings and can’t be compared to other types. Also, there are some types that don’t have a defined ordering relation. For example, isn’t a valid comparison. The list methods make it very easy to use a list as a stack, where the last element added is the first element retrieved (“last-in, first-out”). To add an item to the top of the stack, use . To retrieve an item from the top of the stack, use without an explicit index. For example: It is also possible to use a list as a queue, where the first element added is the first element retrieved (“first-in, first-out”); however, lists are not efficient for this purpose. While appends and pops from the end of list are fast, doing inserts or pops from the beginning of a list is slow (because all of the other elements have to be shifted by one). To implement a queue, use which was designed to have fast appends and pops from both ends. For example: # The first to arrive now leaves # The second to arrive now leaves List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. Common applications are to make new lists where each element is the result of some operations applied to each member of another sequence or iterable, or to create a subsequence of those elements that satisfy a certain condition. For example, assume we want to create a list of squares, like: Note that this creates (or overwrites) a variable named that still exists after the loop completes. We can calculate the list of squares without any side effects using: which is more concise and readable. A list comprehension consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a clause, then zero or more or clauses. The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the context of the and clauses which follow it. For example, this listcomp combines the elements of two lists if they are not equal: Note how the order of the and statements is the same in both these snippets. If the expression is a tuple (e.g. the in the previous example), it must be parenthesized. # create a new list with the values doubled # apply a function to all the elements # the tuple must be parenthesized, otherwise an error is raised File , line : did you forget parentheses around the comprehension target? # flatten a list using a listcomp with two 'for' List comprehensions can contain complex expressions and nested functions: The initial expression in a list comprehension can be any arbitrary expression, including another list comprehension. Consider the following example of a 3x4 matrix implemented as a list of 3 lists of length 4: The following list comprehension will transpose rows and columns: As we saw in the previous section, the inner list comprehension is evaluated in the context of the that follows it, so this example is equivalent to: which, in turn, is the same as: # the following 3 lines implement the nested listcomp In the real world, you should prefer built-in functions to complex flow statements. The function would do a great job for this use case: See Unpacking Argument Lists for details on the asterisk in this line.\n\nWe saw that lists and strings have many common properties, such as indexing and slicing operations. They are two examples of sequence data types (see Sequence Types — list, tuple, range). Since Python is an evolving language, other sequence data types may be added. There is also another standard sequence data type: the tuple. A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas, for instance: File , line , in : # but they can contain mutable objects: As you see, on output tuples are always enclosed in parentheses, so that nested tuples are interpreted correctly; they may be input with or without surrounding parentheses, although often parentheses are necessary anyway (if the tuple is part of a larger expression). It is not possible to assign to the individual items of a tuple, however it is possible to create tuples which contain mutable objects, such as lists. Though tuples may seem similar to lists, they are often used in different situations and for different purposes. Tuples are immutable, and usually contain a heterogeneous sequence of elements that are accessed via unpacking (see later in this section) or indexing (or even by attribute in the case of ). Lists are mutable, and their elements are usually homogeneous and are accessed by iterating over the list. A special problem is the construction of tuples containing 0 or 1 items: the syntax has some extra quirks to accommodate these. Empty tuples are constructed by an empty pair of parentheses; a tuple with one item is constructed by following a value with a comma (it is not sufficient to enclose a single value in parentheses). Ugly, but effective. For example: The statement is an example of tuple packing: the values , and are packed together in a tuple. The reverse operation is also possible: This is called, appropriately enough, sequence unpacking and works for any sequence on the right-hand side. Sequence unpacking requires that there are as many variables on the left side of the equals sign as there are elements in the sequence. Note that multiple assignment is really just a combination of tuple packing and sequence unpacking.\n\nPython also includes a data type for sets. A set is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements. Basic uses include membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries. Set objects also support mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference. Curly braces or the function can be used to create sets. Note: to create an empty set you have to use , not ; the latter creates an empty dictionary, a data structure that we discuss in the next section. Here is a brief demonstration: # show that duplicates have been removed # Demonstrate set operations on unique letters from two words # letters in a but not in b # letters in a or b or both # letters in both a and b # letters in a or b but not both Similarly to list comprehensions, set comprehensions are also supported:\n\nAnother useful data type built into Python is the dictionary (see Mapping Types — dict). Dictionaries are sometimes found in other languages as “associative memories” or “associative arrays”. Unlike sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys, which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys. Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key. You can’t use lists as keys, since lists can be modified in place using index assignments, slice assignments, or methods like and . It is best to think of a dictionary as a set of key: value pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary). A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary: . Placing a comma-separated list of key:value pairs within the braces adds initial key:value pairs to the dictionary; this is also the way dictionaries are written on output. The main operations on a dictionary are storing a value with some key and extracting the value given the key. It is also possible to delete a key:value pair with . If you store using a key that is already in use, the old value associated with that key is forgotten. It is an error to extract a value using a non-existent key. Performing on a dictionary returns a list of all the keys used in the dictionary, in insertion order (if you want it sorted, just use instead). To check whether a single key is in the dictionary, use the keyword. Here is a small example using a dictionary: The constructor builds dictionaries directly from sequences of key-value pairs: In addition, dict comprehensions can be used to create dictionaries from arbitrary key and value expressions: When the keys are simple strings, it is sometimes easier to specify pairs using keyword arguments:\n\nWhen looping through dictionaries, the key and corresponding value can be retrieved at the same time using the method. When looping through a sequence, the position index and corresponding value can be retrieved at the same time using the function. To loop over two or more sequences at the same time, the entries can be paired with the function. What is your name? It is lancelot. What is your quest? It is the holy grail. What is your favorite color? It is blue. To loop over a sequence in reverse, first specify the sequence in a forward direction and then call the function. To loop over a sequence in sorted order, use the function which returns a new sorted list while leaving the source unaltered. Using on a sequence eliminates duplicate elements. The use of in combination with over a sequence is an idiomatic way to loop over unique elements of the sequence in sorted order. It is sometimes tempting to change a list while you are looping over it; however, it is often simpler and safer to create a new list instead.\n\nThe conditions used in and statements can contain any operators, not just comparisons. The comparison operators and are membership tests that determine whether a value is in (or not in) a container. The operators and compare whether two objects are really the same object. All comparison operators have the same priority, which is lower than that of all numerical operators. Comparisons can be chained. For example, tests whether is less than and moreover equals . Comparisons may be combined using the Boolean operators and , and the outcome of a comparison (or of any other Boolean expression) may be negated with . These have lower priorities than comparison operators; between them, has the highest priority and the lowest, so that A and not B or C is equivalent to (A and (not B)) or C . As always, parentheses can be used to express the desired composition. The Boolean operators and are so-called short-circuit operators: their arguments are evaluated from left to right, and evaluation stops as soon as the outcome is determined. For example, if and are true but is false, A and B and C does not evaluate the expression . When used as a general value and not as a Boolean, the return value of a short-circuit operator is the last evaluated argument. It is possible to assign the result of a comparison or other Boolean expression to a variable. For example, Note that in Python, unlike C, assignment inside expressions must be done explicitly with the walrus operator . This avoids a common class of problems encountered in C programs: typing in an expression when was intended.\n\nSequence objects typically may be compared to other objects with the same sequence type. The comparison uses lexicographical ordering: first the first two items are compared, and if they differ this determines the outcome of the comparison; if they are equal, the next two items are compared, and so on, until either sequence is exhausted. If two items to be compared are themselves sequences of the same type, the lexicographical comparison is carried out recursively. If all items of two sequences compare equal, the sequences are considered equal. If one sequence is an initial sub-sequence of the other, the shorter sequence is the smaller (lesser) one. Lexicographical ordering for strings uses the Unicode code point number to order individual characters. Some examples of comparisons between sequences of the same type: Note that comparing objects of different types with or is legal provided that the objects have appropriate comparison methods. For example, mixed numeric types are compared according to their numeric value, so 0 equals 0.0, etc. Otherwise, rather than providing an arbitrary ordering, the interpreter will raise a exception."

        "document": "The Python interpreter has a number of functions and types built into it that are always available. They are listed here in alphabetical order.\n\nOpen file and return a corresponding file object. If the file cannot be opened, an is raised. See Reading and Writing Files for more examples of how to use this function. file is a path-like object giving the pathname (absolute or relative to the current working directory) of the file to be opened or an integer file descriptor of the file to be wrapped. (If a file descriptor is given, it is closed when the returned I/O object is closed unless closefd is set to .) mode is an optional string that specifies the mode in which the file is opened. It defaults to which means open for reading in text mode. Other common values are for writing (truncating the file if it already exists), for exclusive creation, and for appending (which on some Unix systems, means that all writes append to the end of the file regardless of the current seek position). In text mode, if encoding is not specified the encoding used is platform-dependent: is called to get the current locale encoding. (For reading and writing raw bytes use binary mode and leave encoding unspecified.) The available modes are: open for writing, truncating the file first open for exclusive creation, failing if the file already exists open for writing, appending to the end of file if it exists The default mode is (open for reading text, a synonym of ). Modes and open and truncate the file. Modes and open the file with no truncation. As mentioned in the Overview, Python distinguishes between binary and text I/O. Files opened in binary mode (including in the mode argument) return contents as objects without any decoding. In text mode (the default, or when is included in the mode argument), the contents of the file are returned as , the bytes having been first decoded using a platform-dependent encoding or using the specified encoding if given. Python doesn’t depend on the underlying operating system’s notion of text files; all the processing is done by Python itself, and is therefore platform-independent. buffering is an optional integer used to set the buffering policy. Pass 0 to switch buffering off (only allowed in binary mode), 1 to select line buffering (only usable when writing in text mode), and an integer > 1 to indicate the size in bytes of a fixed-size chunk buffer. Note that specifying a buffer size this way applies for binary buffered I/O, but (i.e., files opened with ) would have another buffering. To disable buffering in , consider using the flag for . When no buffering argument is given, the default buffering policy works as follows:\n• None Binary files are buffered in fixed-size chunks; the size of the buffer is chosen using a heuristic trying to determine the underlying device’s “block size” and falling back on . On many systems, the buffer will typically be 4096 or 8192 bytes long.\n• None “Interactive” text files (files for which returns ) use line buffering. Other text files use the policy described above for binary files. encoding is the name of the encoding used to decode or encode the file. This should only be used in text mode. The default encoding is platform dependent (whatever returns), but any text encoding supported by Python can be used. See the module for the list of supported encodings. errors is an optional string that specifies how encoding and decoding errors are to be handled—this cannot be used in binary mode. A variety of standard error handlers are available (listed under Error Handlers), though any error handling name that has been registered with is also valid. The standard names include:\n• None to raise a exception if there is an encoding error. The default value of has the same effect.\n• None ignores errors. Note that ignoring encoding errors can lead to data loss.\n• None causes a replacement marker (such as ) to be inserted where there is malformed data.\n• None will represent any incorrect bytes as low surrogate code units ranging from U+DC80 to U+DCFF. These surrogate code units will then be turned back into the same bytes when the error handler is used when writing data. This is useful for processing files in an unknown encoding.\n• None is only supported when writing to a file. Characters not supported by the encoding are replaced with the appropriate XML character reference .\n• None (also only supported when writing) replaces unsupported characters with escape sequences. newline determines how to parse newline characters from the stream. It can be , , , , and . It works as follows:\n• None When reading input from the stream, if newline is , universal newlines mode is enabled. Lines in the input can end in , , or , and these are translated into before being returned to the caller. If it is , universal newlines mode is enabled, but line endings are returned to the caller untranslated. If it has any of the other legal values, input lines are only terminated by the given string, and the line ending is returned to the caller untranslated.\n• None When writing output to the stream, if newline is , any characters written are translated to the system default line separator, . If newline is or , no translation takes place. If newline is any of the other legal values, any characters written are translated to the given string. If closefd is and a file descriptor rather than a filename was given, the underlying file descriptor will be kept open when the file is closed. If a filename is given closefd must be (the default); otherwise, an error will be raised. A custom opener can be used by passing a callable as opener. The underlying file descriptor for the file object is then obtained by calling opener with (file, flags). opener must return an open file descriptor (passing as opener results in functionality similar to passing ). The following example uses the dir_fd parameter of the function to open a file relative to a given directory: 'This will be written to somedir/spamspam.txt' The type of file object returned by the function depends on the mode. When is used to open a file in a text mode ( , , , , etc.), it returns a subclass of (specifically ). When used to open a file in a binary mode with buffering, the returned class is a subclass of . The exact class varies: in read binary mode, it returns an ; in write binary and append binary modes, it returns an , and in read/write mode, it returns an . When buffering is disabled, the raw stream, a subclass of , , is returned. See also the file handling modules, such as , (where is declared), , , , and . The and arguments may have been modified or inferred from the original call.\n• None used to be raised, it is now an alias of .\n• None is now raised if the file opened in exclusive creation mode ( ) already exists.\n• None The file is now non-inheritable.\n• None If the system call is interrupted and the signal handler does not raise an exception, the function now retries the system call instead of raising an exception (see PEP 475 for the rationale).\n• None On Windows, opening a console buffer may return a subclass of other than . Changed in version 3.11: The mode has been removed.\n\nReturn a proxy object that delegates method calls to a parent or sibling class of type. This is useful for accessing inherited methods that have been overridden in a class. The object_or_type determines the method resolution order to be searched. The search starts from the class right after the type. For example, if of object_or_type is and the value of type is , then searches . The attribute of the class corresponding to object_or_type lists the method resolution search order used by both and . The attribute is dynamic and can change whenever the inheritance hierarchy is updated. If the second argument is omitted, the super object returned is unbound. If the second argument is an object, must be true. If the second argument is a type, must be true (this is useful for classmethods). When called directly within an ordinary method of a class, both arguments may be omitted (“zero-argument ”). In this case, type will be the enclosing class, and obj will be the first argument of the immediately enclosing function (typically ). (This means that zero-argument will not work as expected within nested functions, including generator expressions, which implicitly create nested functions.) There are two typical use cases for super. In a class hierarchy with single inheritance, super can be used to refer to parent classes without naming them explicitly, thus making the code more maintainable. This use closely parallels the use of super in other programming languages. The second use case is to support cooperative multiple inheritance in a dynamic execution environment. This use case is unique to Python and is not found in statically compiled languages or languages that only support single inheritance. This makes it possible to implement “diamond diagrams” where multiple base classes implement the same method. Good design dictates that such implementations have the same calling signature in every case (because the order of calls is determined at runtime, because that order adapts to changes in the class hierarchy, and because that order can include sibling classes that are unknown prior to runtime). For both use cases, a typical superclass call looks like this: # This does the same thing as: In addition to method lookups, also works for attribute lookups. One possible use case for this is calling descriptors in a parent or sibling class. Note that is implemented as part of the binding process for explicit dotted attribute lookups such as . It does so by implementing its own method for searching classes in a predictable order that supports cooperative multiple inheritance. Accordingly, is undefined for implicit lookups using statements or operators such as . Also note that, aside from the zero argument form, is not limited to use inside methods. The two argument form specifies the arguments exactly and makes the appropriate references. The zero argument form only works inside a class definition, as the compiler fills in the necessary details to correctly retrieve the class being defined, as well as accessing the current instance for ordinary methods.

        "document": "The following sections describe the standard types that are built into the interpreter.\n\nThe principal built-in types are numerics, sequences, mappings, classes, instances and exceptions.\n\nSome collection classes are mutable. The methods that add, subtract, or rearrange their members in place, and don’t return a specific item, never return the collection instance itself but .\n\nSome operations are supported by several object types; in particular, practically all objects can be compared for equality, tested for truth value, and converted to a string (with the function or the slightly different function). The latter function is implicitly used when an object is written by the function.\n\nThere are three distinct numeric types: integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers. In addition, Booleans are a subtype of integers. Integers have unlimited precision. Floating-point numbers are usually implemented using double in C; information about the precision and internal representation of floating-point numbers for the machine on which your program is running is available in . Complex numbers have a real and imaginary part, which are each a floating-point number. To extract these parts from a complex number z, use and . (The standard library includes the additional numeric types , for rationals, and , for floating-point numbers with user-definable precision.) Numbers are created by numeric literals or as the result of built-in functions and operators. Unadorned integer literals (including hex, octal and binary numbers) yield integers. Numeric literals containing a decimal point or an exponent sign yield floating-point numbers. Appending or to a numeric literal yields an imaginary number (a complex number with a zero real part) which you can add to an integer or float to get a complex number with real and imaginary parts. Python fully supports mixed arithmetic: when a binary arithmetic operator has operands of different numeric types, the operand with the “narrower” type is widened to that of the other, where integer is narrower than floating point, which is narrower than complex. A comparison between numbers of different types behaves as though the exact values of those numbers were being compared. The constructors , , and can be used to produce numbers of a specific type. All numeric types (except complex) support the following operations (for priorities of the operations, see Operator precedence): absolute value or magnitude of x a complex number with real part re, imaginary part im. im defaults to zero. conjugate of the complex number c\n• None Also referred to as integer division. For operands of type , the result has type . For operands of type , the result has type . In general, the result is a whole integer, though the result’s type is not necessarily . The result is always rounded towards minus infinity: is , is , is , and is .\n• None Not for complex numbers. Instead convert to floats using if appropriate.\n• None Conversion from to truncates, discarding the fractional part. See functions and for alternative conversions.\n• None float also accepts the strings “nan” and “inf” with an optional prefix “+” or “-” for Not a Number (NaN) and positive or negative infinity.\n• None Python defines and to be , as is common for programming languages.\n• None The numeric literals accepted include the digits to or any Unicode equivalent (code points with the property). See the Unicode Standard for a complete list of code points with the property. All types ( and ) also include the following operations: x rounded to n digits, rounding half to even. If n is omitted, it defaults to 0. For additional numeric operations see the and modules. Bitwise operations only make sense for integers. The result of bitwise operations is calculated as though carried out in two’s complement with an infinite number of sign bits. The priorities of the binary bitwise operations are all lower than the numeric operations and higher than the comparisons; the unary operation has the same priority as the other unary numeric operations ( and ). This table lists the bitwise operations sorted in ascending priority: bitwise exclusive or of x and y\n• None Negative shift counts are illegal and cause a to be raised.\n• None A left shift by n bits is equivalent to multiplication by .\n• None A right shift by n bits is equivalent to floor division by .\n• None Performing these calculations with at least one extra sign extension bit in a finite two’s complement representation (a working bit-width of or more) is sufficient to get the same result as if there were an infinite number of sign bits. The int type implements the abstract base class. In addition, it provides a few more methods: Return the number of bits necessary to represent an integer in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros: More precisely, if is nonzero, then is the unique positive integer such that . Equivalently, when is small enough to have a correctly rounded logarithm, then . If is zero, then returns . Return the number of ones in the binary representation of the absolute value of the integer. This is also known as the population count. Example: Return an array of bytes representing an integer. The integer is represented using length bytes, and defaults to 1. An is raised if the integer is not representable with the given number of bytes. The byteorder argument determines the byte order used to represent the integer, and defaults to . If byteorder is , the most significant byte is at the beginning of the byte array. If byteorder is , the most significant byte is at the end of the byte array. The signed argument determines whether two’s complement is used to represent the integer. If signed is and a negative integer is given, an is raised. The default value for signed is . The default values can be used to conveniently turn an integer into a single byte object: However, when using the default arguments, don’t try to convert a value greater than 255 or you’ll get an . \"byteorder must be either 'little' or 'big'\" Changed in version 3.11: Added default argument values for and . Return the integer represented by the given array of bytes. The argument bytes must either be a bytes-like object or an iterable producing bytes. The byteorder argument determines the byte order used to represent the integer, and defaults to . If byteorder is , the most significant byte is at the beginning of the byte array. If byteorder is , the most significant byte is at the end of the byte array. To request the native byte order of the host system, use as the byte order value. The signed argument indicates whether two’s complement is used to represent the integer. \"byteorder must be either 'little' or 'big'\" Changed in version 3.11: Added default argument value for . Return a pair of integers whose ratio is equal to the original integer and has a positive denominator. The integer ratio of integers (whole numbers) is always the integer as the numerator and as the denominator. The float type implements the abstract base class. float also has the following additional methods. Return a pair of integers whose ratio is exactly equal to the original float. The ratio is in lowest terms and has a positive denominator. Raises on infinities and a on NaNs. Return if the float instance is finite with integral value, and otherwise: Two methods support conversion to and from hexadecimal strings. Since Python’s floats are stored internally as binary numbers, converting a float to or from a decimal string usually involves a small rounding error. In contrast, hexadecimal strings allow exact representation and specification of floating-point numbers. This can be useful when debugging, and in numerical work. Return a representation of a floating-point number as a hexadecimal string. For finite floating-point numbers, this representation will always include a leading and a trailing and exponent. Class method to return the float represented by a hexadecimal string s. The string s may have leading and trailing whitespace. Note that is an instance method, while is a class method. where the optional may by either or , and are strings of hexadecimal digits, and is a decimal integer with an optional leading sign. Case is not significant, and there must be at least one hexadecimal digit in either the integer or the fraction. This syntax is similar to the syntax specified in section 6.4.4.2 of the C99 standard, and also to the syntax used in Java 1.5 onwards. In particular, the output of is usable as a hexadecimal floating-point literal in C or Java code, and hexadecimal strings produced by C’s format character or Java’s are accepted by . Note that the exponent is written in decimal rather than hexadecimal, and that it gives the power of 2 by which to multiply the coefficient. For example, the hexadecimal string represents the floating-point number , or : Applying the reverse conversion to gives a different hexadecimal string representing the same number: For numbers and , possibly of different types, it’s a requirement that whenever (see the method documentation for more details). For ease of implementation and efficiency across a variety of numeric types (including , , and ) Python’s hash for numeric types is based on a single mathematical function that’s defined for any rational number, and hence applies to all instances of and , and all finite instances of and . Essentially, this function is given by reduction modulo for a fixed prime . The value of is made available to Python as the attribute of . CPython implementation detail: Currently, the prime used is on machines with 32-bit C longs and on machines with 64-bit C longs. Here are the rules in detail:\n• None If is a nonnegative rational number and is not divisible by , define as , where gives the inverse of modulo .\n• None If is a nonnegative rational number and is divisible by (but is not) then has no inverse modulo and the rule above doesn’t apply; in this case define to be the constant value .\n• None If is a negative rational number define as . If the resulting hash is , replace it with .\n• None The particular values and are used as hash values for positive infinity or negative infinity (respectively).\n• None For a number , the hash values of the real and imaginary parts are combined by computing , reduced modulo so that it lies in . Again, if the result is , it’s replaced with . To clarify the above rules, here’s some example Python code, equivalent to the built-in hash, for computing the hash of a rational number, , or : Assumes m and n are integers, with n positive. # Remove common factors of P. (Unnecessary if m and n already coprime.) # Fermat's Little Theorem: pow(n, P-1, P) is 1, so # pow(n, P-2, P) gives the inverse of n modulo P.\n\nThere are three basic sequence types: lists, tuples, and range objects. Additional sequence types tailored for processing of binary data and text strings are described in dedicated sections. The operations in the following table are supported by most sequence types, both mutable and immutable. The ABC is provided to make it easier to correctly implement these operations on custom sequence types. This table lists the sequence operations sorted in ascending priority. In the table, s and t are sequences of the same type, n, i, j and k are integers and x is an arbitrary object that meets any type and value restrictions imposed by s. The and operations have the same priorities as the comparison operations. The (concatenation) and (repetition) operations have the same priority as the corresponding numeric operations. if an item of s is equal to x, else if an item of s is equal to x, else the concatenation of s and t equivalent to adding s to itself n times slice of s from i to j with step k index of the first occurrence of x in s (at or after index i and before index j) total number of occurrences of x in s Sequences of the same type also support comparisons. In particular, tuples and lists are compared lexicographically by comparing corresponding elements. This means that to compare equal, every element must compare equal and the two sequences must be of the same type and have the same length. (For full details see Comparisons in the language reference.) Forward and reversed iterators over mutable sequences access values using an index. That index will continue to march forward (or backward) even if the underlying sequence is mutated. The iterator terminates only when an or a is encountered (or when the index drops below zero).\n• None While the and operations are used only for simple containment testing in the general case, some specialised sequences (such as , and ) also use them for subsequence testing:\n• None Values of n less than are treated as (which yields an empty sequence of the same type as s). Note that items in the sequence s are not copied; they are referenced multiple times. This often haunts new Python programmers; consider: What has happened is that is a one-element list containing an empty list, so all three elements of are references to this single empty list. Modifying any of the elements of modifies this single list. You can create a list of different lists this way: Further explanation is available in the FAQ entry How do I create a multidimensional list?.\n• None If i or j is negative, the index is relative to the end of sequence s: or is substituted. But note that is still .\n• None The slice of s from i to j is defined as the sequence of items with index k such that . If i or j is greater than , use . If i is omitted or , use . If j is omitted or , use . If i is greater than or equal to j, the slice is empty.\n• None The slice of s from i to j with step k is defined as the sequence of items with index such that . In other words, the indices are , , , and so on, stopping when j is reached (but never including j). When k is positive, i and j are reduced to if they are greater. When k is negative, i and j are reduced to if they are greater. If i or j are omitted or , they become “end” values (which end depends on the sign of k). Note, k cannot be zero. If k is , it is treated like .\n• None Concatenating immutable sequences always results in a new object. This means that building up a sequence by repeated concatenation will have a quadratic runtime cost in the total sequence length. To get a linear runtime cost, you must switch to one of the alternatives below:\n• None if concatenating objects, you can build a list and use at the end or else write to an instance and retrieve its value when complete\n• None if concatenating objects, you can similarly use or , or you can do in-place concatenation with a object. objects are mutable and have an efficient overallocation mechanism\n• None for other types, investigate the relevant class documentation\n• None Some sequence types (such as ) only support item sequences that follow specific patterns, and hence don’t support sequence concatenation or repetition.\n• None raises when x is not found in s. Not all implementations support passing the additional arguments i and j. These arguments allow efficient searching of subsections of the sequence. Passing the extra arguments is roughly equivalent to using , only without copying any data and with the returned index being relative to the start of the sequence rather than the start of the slice. The only operation that immutable sequence types generally implement that is not also implemented by mutable sequence types is support for the built-in. This support allows immutable sequences, such as instances, to be used as keys and stored in and instances. Attempting to hash an immutable sequence that contains unhashable values will result in . The operations in the following table are defined on mutable sequence types. The ABC is provided to make it easier to correctly implement these operations on custom sequence types. In the table s is an instance of a mutable sequence type, t is any iterable object and x is an arbitrary object that meets any type and value restrictions imposed by s (for example, only accepts integers that meet the value restriction ). item i of s is replaced by x slice of s from i to j is replaced by the contents of the iterable t the elements of are replaced by those of t removes the elements of from the list appends x to the end of the sequence (same as ) removes all items from s (same as ) creates a shallow copy of s (same as ) extends s with the contents of t (for the most part the same as ) inserts x into s at the index given by i (same as ) retrieves the item at i and also removes it from s removes the first item from s where is equal to x reverses the items of s in place\n• None If k is not equal to , t must have the same length as the slice it is replacing.\n• None The optional argument i defaults to , so that by default the last item is removed and returned.\n• None raises when x is not found in s.\n• None The method modifies the sequence in place for economy of space when reversing a large sequence. To remind users that it operates by side effect, it does not return the reversed sequence.\n• None and are included for consistency with the interfaces of mutable containers that don’t support slicing operations (such as and ). is not part of the ABC, but most concrete mutable sequence classes provide it.\n• None The value n is an integer, or an object implementing . Zero and negative values of n clear the sequence. Items in the sequence are not copied; they are referenced multiple times, as explained for under Common Sequence Operations. Lists are mutable sequences, typically used to store collections of homogeneous items (where the precise degree of similarity will vary by application). Lists may be constructed in several ways:\n• None Using a pair of square brackets to denote the empty list:\n• None Using the type constructor: or The constructor builds a list whose items are the same and in the same order as iterable’s items. iterable may be either a sequence, a container that supports iteration, or an iterator object. If iterable is already a list, a copy is made and returned, similar to . For example, returns and returns . If no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty list, . Many other operations also produce lists, including the built-in. Lists implement all of the common and mutable sequence operations. Lists also provide the following additional method: This method sorts the list in place, using only comparisons between items. Exceptions are not suppressed - if any comparison operations fail, the entire sort operation will fail (and the list will likely be left in a partially modified state). accepts two arguments that can only be passed by keyword (keyword-only arguments): key specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each list element (for example, ). The key corresponding to each item in the list is calculated once and then used for the entire sorting process. The default value of means that list items are sorted directly without calculating a separate key value. The utility is available to convert a 2.x style cmp function to a key function. reverse is a boolean value. If set to , then the list elements are sorted as if each comparison were reversed. This method modifies the sequence in place for economy of space when sorting a large sequence. To remind users that it operates by side effect, it does not return the sorted sequence (use to explicitly request a new sorted list instance). The method is guaranteed to be stable. A sort is stable if it guarantees not to change the relative order of elements that compare equal — this is helpful for sorting in multiple passes (for example, sort by department, then by salary grade). For sorting examples and a brief sorting tutorial, see Sorting Techniques. CPython implementation detail: While a list is being sorted, the effect of attempting to mutate, or even inspect, the list is undefined. The C implementation of Python makes the list appear empty for the duration, and raises if it can detect that the list has been mutated during a sort. Tuples are immutable sequences, typically used to store collections of heterogeneous data (such as the 2-tuples produced by the built-in). Tuples are also used for cases where an immutable sequence of homogeneous data is needed (such as allowing storage in a or instance). Tuples may be constructed in a number of ways:\n• None Using a pair of parentheses to denote the empty tuple:\n• None Using a trailing comma for a singleton tuple: or\n• None Using the built-in: or The constructor builds a tuple whose items are the same and in the same order as iterable’s items. iterable may be either a sequence, a container that supports iteration, or an iterator object. If iterable is already a tuple, it is returned unchanged. For example, returns and returns . If no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty tuple, . Note that it is actually the comma which makes a tuple, not the parentheses. The parentheses are optional, except in the empty tuple case, or when they are needed to avoid syntactic ambiguity. For example, is a function call with three arguments, while is a function call with a 3-tuple as the sole argument. Tuples implement all of the common sequence operations. For heterogeneous collections of data where access by name is clearer than access by index, may be a more appropriate choice than a simple tuple object. The type represents an immutable sequence of numbers and is commonly used for looping a specific number of times in loops. The arguments to the range constructor must be integers (either built-in or any object that implements the special method). If the step argument is omitted, it defaults to . If the start argument is omitted, it defaults to . If step is zero, is raised. For a positive step, the contents of a range are determined by the formula where and . For a negative step, the contents of the range are still determined by the formula , but the constraints are and . A range object will be empty if does not meet the value constraint. Ranges do support negative indices, but these are interpreted as indexing from the end of the sequence determined by the positive indices. Ranges containing absolute values larger than are permitted but some features (such as ) may raise . Ranges implement all of the common sequence operations except concatenation and repetition (due to the fact that range objects can only represent sequences that follow a strict pattern and repetition and concatenation will usually violate that pattern). The value of the start parameter (or if the parameter was not supplied) The value of the stop parameter The value of the step parameter (or if the parameter was not supplied) The advantage of the type over a regular or is that a object will always take the same (small) amount of memory, no matter the size of the range it represents (as it only stores the , and values, calculating individual items and subranges as needed). Range objects implement the ABC, and provide features such as containment tests, element index lookup, slicing and support for negative indices (see Sequence Types — list, tuple, range): Testing range objects for equality with and compares them as sequences. That is, two range objects are considered equal if they represent the same sequence of values. (Note that two range objects that compare equal might have different , and attributes, for example or .) Changed in version 3.2: Implement the Sequence ABC. Support slicing and negative indices. Test objects for membership in constant time instead of iterating through all items. Changed in version 3.3: Define ‘==’ and ‘!=’ to compare range objects based on the sequence of values they define (instead of comparing based on object identity).\n• None The linspace recipe shows how to implement a lazy version of range suitable for floating-point applications."

        "document": "A tuple in Python is similar to a list. The difference between the two is that we cannot change the elements of a tuple once it is assigned whereas we can change the elements of a list.\n\nA tuple is created by placing all the items (elements) inside parentheses , separated by commas. The parentheses are optional, however, it is a good practice to use them. A tuple can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer, float, list, string, etc.). A tuple can also be created without using parentheses. This is known as tuple packing. Creating a tuple with one element is a bit tricky. Having one element within parentheses is not enough. We will need a trailing comma to indicate that it is, in fact, a tuple.\n\nThere are various ways in which we can access the elements of a tuple. We can use the index operator [] to access an item in a tuple, where the index starts from 0. So, a tuple having 6 elements will have indices from 0 to 5. Trying to access an index outside of the tuple index range(6,7,… in this example) will raise an IndexError. The index must be an integer, so we cannot use float or other types. This will result in TypeError. Likewise, nested tuples are accessed using nested indexing, as shown in the example below. Python allows negative indexing for its sequences. The index of -1 refers to the last item, -2 to the second last item and so on. We can access a range of items in a tuple by using the slicing operator colon :.\n\nThis means that elements of a tuple cannot be changed once they have been assigned. But, if the element is itself a mutable data type like list, its nested items can be changed. We can also assign a tuple to different values (reassignment). We can use + operator to combine two tuples. This is called concatenation. We can also repeat the elements in a tuple for a given number of times using the * operator. Both + and * operations result in a new tuple.\n\nAs discussed above, we cannot change the elements in a tuple. It means that we cannot delete or remove items from a tuple. Deleting a tuple entirely, however, is possible using the keyword del. NameError: name ‘my_tuple’ is not defined\n\nSince tuples are quite similar to lists, both of them are used in similar situations. However, there are certain advantages of implementing a tuple over a list. Below listed are some of the main advantages:\n• We generally use tuples for heterogeneous (different) data types and lists for homogeneous (similar) data types.\n• Since tuples are immutable, iterating through a tuple is faster than with list. So there is a slight performance boost.\n• Tuples that contain immutable elements can be used as a key for a dictionary. With lists, this is not possible.\n• If you have data that doesn’t change, implementing it as tuple will guarantee that it remains write-protected."
