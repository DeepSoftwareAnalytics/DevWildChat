When you use it, everything in your existing columns shifts over to make space for the new, empty column.\n\nIn this tutorial, we will look at how to insert a column using a VBA code in Excel. We will also explore what are the different ways to write a macro for this.\n\nTo insert a column using a VBA code, you need to use the “Entire Column” property with the “Insert” method. With the entire column property, you can refer to the entire column using a cell and then insert a new column. By default, it will insert a column before the cell that you have mentioned.\n• First, specify a cell using the range object.\n• Now, enter a dot (.) to get the list of properties and methods.\n• After that, select the “Entire Column” property or type it.\n• In the end, again enter a dot (.) and select the “Insert” method or type it.\n\nYour code is ready here to insert a column. Now when you run this code, it will instantly insert a new column before the column A.\n\nThere are two ways to insert multiple columns in a worksheet that I have found. The first is the same insert method that we have used in the above example. With this, you need to specify a range of columns whose count is equal to the count of the column you want to insert.\n\nNow let’s say you want to insert 5 columns after column C in the case you can use a code like the following.\n\nTo be honest, I haven’t found this method quite useful because you need to change the range if you want to change the code itself. So, here’s the second method.\n\nWhen you run this code, it asks you to enter the number of columns that you want to add and then the column number where you want to add all those new columns. It uses a FOR LOOP (For Next) to enter the number of columns that you have mentioned.\n\nTo insert a new column after a specific column, you can use the Insert method and specify the column after which you want to add the new column.\n\nThe above code tells Excel to insert a new column to the right of column E. The Shift:=xlToRight moves all existing columns to the right to make space for the new one. The CopyOrigin:=xlFormatFromLeftOrAbove copies the formatting from the column to the left of the new column.\n\nIf you want to insert columns based on a cell value, then you can use the following code.\n\nWhen you run this macro, it takes the count of columns from cell A1 and the column where you want to add columns from cell B1.\n\nWhen you insert a column where the above column has some specific formatting, in that case, the column will also have that formatting automatically. And the simplest way to deal with this thing is to use clear formats. Consider the following code.\n\nWhen you run the above code, it inserts a new column before the 7th column. Now, what happens, is when you insert a column before the 7th column that new column becomes the 7th column, and then the second line of code clears the formats from it.\n\nYou can also use the same method to copy a column and then insert it somewhere else. See the following code."

        "document": "This tutorial demonstrates how to use the Excel RANK Function in Excel to rank a number within a series.\n\n\n\nThe RANK Function Rank of a number within a series.\n\nTo use the RANK Excel Worksheet Function, select a cell and type:\n\nnumber – The number that you wish to determine the rank of.\n\norder – OPTIONAL. A number indicating whether to rank descendingly (0 or Ommitted) or ascendingly (non-zero number)\n\nWhat Is the RANK Function?\n\nThe Excel RANK Function tells you the rank of a particular value taken from a data range. That is, how far the value is from the top, or the bottom, when the data is put into order.\n\nAs of Excel 2010, Microsoft replaced RANK with two variations: RANK.EQ and RANK.AVG.\n\nThe older RANK Function still works, so any older spreadsheets using it will continue to function. However, you should use one of the newer functions whenever you don’t need to remain compatible with older spreadsheets.\n\nHow to Use the RANK Function\n\nUse RANK like this:\n\nAbove is a table of data listing the heights of a group of friends. We want to know where Gunther ranks in the list.\n• The first is the value you want to rank (we’ve set this to C10, Gunther’s height, but we could also put the value in directly as 180)\n• The second is range of data – C4:C13\n• The third is the order of the rank\n• If you set this to FALSE, 0, or leave it blank, the highest value will be ranked as #1 (descending order)\n• If you set this to TRUE or any non-zero number, the lowest value will be ranked as #1 (ascending order)\n\nRANK determines that Gunther is the 4th tallest of the group, and if we put the data in order, we see that this is true:\n\nA few key points about the RANK Function:\n• When determining the order, text strings will result in a #VALUE! error\n• As you’ve just seen, you don’t need to sort the data for RANK to work correctly\n\nIn the below table I’ve added a column to the table that returns the rank of each member of the group. I used the following formula:\n\nNote that I’ve locked the data range $C$4:$C$13 by select “C4:C13” in the formula bar, and then pressing F4. This keeps this part of the formula the same so that you can copy it down the table without it changing.\n\nWe have a tie! Both Joey and Mike are 178cm tall.\n\nIn such cases, RANK assigns both values the highest rank – so both Joey and Mike are ranked 5th. Because of the tie, there is no 6th place, so the next tallest friend, Phoebe, is in 7th place.\n\nHow to Use RANK.EQ\n\nRANK.EQ works in the same way as RANK. You use it like this:\n\nAs you can see here, with RANK.EQ you define exactly the same arguments as with RANK, namely, the number you want to rank, the data range, and the order. We’re looking for Gunther’s rank again, and RANK.EQ returns the same result: 4.\n\nRANK.EQ also handles ties in the same way as RANK, as shown below:\n\nAgain, Joey and Mike are tied at 5th place.\n\nHow to Use RANK.AVG\n\nRANK.AVG is very similar to RANK.EQ and RANK. It only differs in the way it handles ties. So if you’re just looking for the rank of a single value, all three functions will return the same result:\n\nOnce again, the same result – 4th place for Gunther.\n\nNow let’s look at how RANK.AVG differs in terms of ties. So this time I’ve used this function:\n\nAnd here are the results:\n\nNow we see something different!\n\nRANK.AVG gives Joey and Mike the same rank, but this time they are assigned the average rank that they would have received had their heights not been equal.\n\nSo, they would have been ranked 5th and 6th, but RANK.AVG has returned the average of 5 and 6: 5.5.\n\nIf more than two values are tied, the same logic applies. Let’s pretend Phoebe has a sudden growth spurt, and her height increases to 178cm overnight. Now RANK.AVG returns the following:\n\nAll three friends how rank 6th: (5 + 6 + 7) / 3 = 6.\n\nExcel doesn’t have a built-in formula that enables you to rank values based on a given criteria, but you can achieve the same result with COUNTIFS.\n\nSay the friends want to create two separate rank orders, one for males and one for females.\n\nCOUNTIFS counts the number of values in a given data range that meet criteria you specify. The formula looks a little intimidating, but it makes more sense if we break it down line-by-line:\n\nSo the first criteria we’ve set is that the range in C4:C13 (again, locked with the dollar signs so that we can drag the formula down the table without that range changing) must match the value in C4.\n\nSo for this row, we’re looking at Richard, and his value is C4 is “Male”. So we’re only going to count people who also have “Male” in this column.\n\nThe second criteria is that D4:D13 must be higher than D4. Effectively, this returns the number of people in the table who’s value in the D column is greater than Richard’s.\n\nThen we add 1 to the result. We need to do this because no one is taller than Richard, so the formula would return 0 otherwise.\n\nNote that this formula handles ties in the same way as RANK.EQ.\n\nLearn more on the main page for the Excel COUNTIF Function.\n\nThe RANK Function works exactly the same in Google Sheets as in Excel:\n\nYou can also use the RANK function in VBA. Type:\n\nwill produce the following results\n\nFor the function arguments (number, etc.), you can either enter them directly into the function, or define variables to use instead."

        "document": "The tutorial explains the specificities of the Excel Rank functions and shows how to do ranking in Excel based on multiple criteria, rank data by group, calculate percentile rank, and more.\n\nWhen you need to determine the relative position of a number in a list of numbers, the easiest way is to sort the numbers in ascending or descending order. If for some reason sorting is not possible, a Rank formula in Excel is the perfect tool to do the job.\n\nThe RANK function in Excel returns the order (or rank) of a numeric value compared to other values in the same list. In other words, it tells you which value is the highest, the second highest, etc. In a sorted list, the rank of a certain number would be its position. The RANK function in Excel can determine the rank starting with the largest value (as if sorted in descending order) or the smallest value (as if sorted in ascending order). The syntax of the Excel RANK function is as follows: Number (required) - the value whose rank you'd like to find. Ref (required) - a list of numeric values to rank against. It can be supplied as an array of numbers or a reference to the list of numbers. Order (optional) - a number that specifies how to rank values:\n• If 0 or omitted, the values are ranked in descending order, i.e. from largest to smallest.\n• If 1 or any other non-zero value, the values are ranked in ascending order, i.e. from smallest to largest.\n\nRANK.EQ is an improved version of the RANK function, introduced in Excel 2010. It has the same syntax as RANK and works with the same logic: if several values are ranked equally, the highest rank is assigned to all such values. (EQ stands for \"equal\"). In Excel 2007 and lower versions, you should always use the RANK function. In Excel 2010, Excel 2013, and Excel 2016, you can go with either RANK or RANK.EQ. However, it'd be wise to use RANK.EQ because RANK can be discontinued at any moment.\n\n\n\nHow to use RANK in Excel - formula examples The path to excellence, they say, is paved with practice. So, to better learn how to use RANK function in Excel, alone or in combination with other functions, let's work out solutions to a few real-life tasks. How to rank in Excel from lowest to highest As shown in the above example, to rank numbers from highest to lowest, you use one of the Excel Rank formulas with the order argument set to 0 or omitted (default). To have number ranked against other numbers sorted in ascending order, put 1 or any other non-zero value in the optional third argument. For example, to rank the 100-meter sprint times of the students, you can use either of the below formulas: Please pay attention that we lock the range in the ref argument by using absolute cell references, so that it won't change when we copy the formula down the column.\n\n As the result, the lowest value (fastest time) is ranked 1st and the largest value (slowest time) gets the lowest rank of 6. The equal times (B2 and B7) are given the same rank.\n\n How to rank data in Excel uniquely As pointed out earlier, all of the Excel Rank functions return the same rank for items of equal value. If that's not want you want, use one of the following formulas to resolve tie-break situations and give a unique rank to each number. To rank the math scores of our students uniquely in descending order, use this formula: To rank the 100-meter race results in ascending order with no duplicates, use this formula: How these formulas work\n\n As you may have noticed, the only difference between the two formulas is the order argument of the RANK.EQ function: omitted to rank values descending, 1 to rank ascending. In both formulas, it's the COUNTIF function with the clever use of relative and absolute cell references that does the trick. In short, you use COUNTIF to find out how many occurrences of the number being ranked there are in the above cells, including the number's cell. In the topmost row where you enter the formula, the range consists of a single cell ($B$2:B2). But because you lock only the first reference ($B$2), the last relative reference (B2) changes based on the row where the formula is copied. Thus, for row 7, the range expands to $B$2:B7, and the value in B7 is compared to each of the above cells. Consequently, for all 1st occurrences, COUNTIF returns 1; and you subtract 1 at the end of the formula to restore the original rank. For 2nd occurrences, COUNTIF returns 2. By subtracting 1 you increment the rank by 1 point, thus preventing duplicates. If there happen to be 3 occurrences of the same value, COUNTIF()-1 would add 2 to their ranking, and so on.\n\n Another way to rank numbers in Excel uniquely is by adding up two COUNTIF functions:\n• The first function determines how many values are greater than or less than the number to be ranked, depending on whether you are ranking descending or ascending, respectively.\n• The second function (with the \"expanding range\" $B$2:B2 as in the above example) gets the number of values equal to the number. For example, to rank numbers uniquely from highest to lowest, you'd use this formula: As shown in the screenshot below, the tie-break is successfully resolved, and a unique rank is assigned to each student:\n\n \n\n The previous example has demonstrated two working solutions for an Excel RANK tie break situation. However, it may seem unfair that equal numbers are ranked differently based solely on their position in the list. To improve your ranking, you may want to add one more criteria to be considered in case of a tie. In our sample dataset, let's add total scores in column C and calculate rank as follows:\n• When there is a tie, break it with Total Score (secondary criteria) To have it done, we will be using a regular RANK/RANK.EQ formula to find rank, and the COUNTIFS function to break a tie: Compared to the above example, this rank formula is more objective: Timothy is ranked 2nd because his total score is higher than that of Julia:\n\n The RANK part of the formula is obvious, and the COUNTIFS function does the following:\n• The first criteria_range/criteria pair ($B$2:$B$7,$B2) counts the occurrences of the value you are ranking. Please notice, we fix the range with absolute references, but do not lock the criteria's row ($B2) so that the formula checks the value in each row individually.\n• The second criteria_range/criteria pair ($C$2:$C$7,\">\"&$C2) finds out how many total scores are greater than the total score of the value being ranked. Because COUNTIFS works with the AND logic, i.e. counts only cells that meet all of the specified conditions, it returns 0 for Timothy since no other student with the same Math score has a higher total score. Hence, Timothy's rank returned by RANK.EQ is unchanged. For Julia, the COUNTIFS function returns 1 because one student with the same Math score has a higher total, so her rank number is incremented by 1. If one more student had the same Math score and a total score lower than that of Timothy and Julia, his/her rank would be incremented by 2, and so on.\n\n Instead of the RANK or RANK.EQ function, you could use COUNTIF to check the main criteria, and COUNTIFS or SUMPRODUCT to resolve a tie break: The result of these formulas are exactly the same as shown above.\n\n How to calculate percentile rank in Excel In statistics, a percentile (or centile) is the value below which a certain percentage of values in a given dataset falls. For example, if 70% of students are equal to or below your test score, your percentile rank is 70. To get percentile rank in Excel, use the RANK or RANK.EQ function with a non-zero order argument to rank numbers from smallest to largest, and then divide the rank by the count of numbers. So, the generic Excel Percentile Rank formula goes as follows: To calculate the percentile rank of our students, the formula takes the following shape: To have the results displayed correctly, be sure to set the Percentage format to the formula cells:\n\n \n\n How to rank numbers in non-adjacent cells In situations when you need to rank non-contiguous cells, supply those cells directly in the ref argument of your Excel Rank formula in the form of a reference union, locking the references with the $ sign. For example: To prevent errors in non-ranked cells, wrap RANK in the IFERROR function, like this: Please notice that a duplicate number is also given a rank, though cell B5 is not included in the formula:\n\n If you need to rank multiple non-contiguous cells, the above formula may become too long. In this case, a more elegant solution would be defining a named range, and referencing that name in the formula: How to rank in Excel by group When working with entries organized into some kind of data structure, data may belong to various groups, and you might want to rank numbers within each group individually. The Excel RANK function cannot resolve this challenge, so we are going to use a more complex SUMPRODUCT formula:\n• C2:C7 are numbers to be ranked. In this example, we use the first formula to rank numbers in each group from largest to smallest:\n\n How this formula works\n\n Essentially, the formula evaluates 2 conditions:\n• First, you check the group (A2=$A$2:$A$7). This part returns an array of TRUE and FALSE based on whether a range element belongs to the same group as A2.\n• Second, you check the score. To rank values from largest to smallest (descending order), use the condition (C2<$C$2:$C$11), which returns TRUE for the cells greater than or equal to C2, FALSE otherwise. Since in Microsoft Excel terms, TRUE = 1 and FALSE = 0, multiplying the two arrays gives an array of 1's and 0's, where 1 is returned only for the rows in which both conditions are met. Then, SUMPRODUCT adds up the elements of the 1's and 0's array, hence returning 0 for the largest number in each group. And you add 1 to the result to start ranking with 1. The formula that ranks numbers within groups from smallest to largest (ascending order) works with the same logic. The difference is that SUMPRODUCT returns 0 for the smallest number in a particular group, since no number in that group meets the 2nd condition (C2>$C$2:$C$7). Again, you replace zero rank with the 1st rank by adding 1 to the formula result. Instead of SUMPRODUCT, you can use the SUM function to add up the array elements. But this would require using an array formula, completed via Ctrl + Shift + Enter. For example: How to rank positive and negative numbers separately If your list of numbers contains both positive and negative values, the Excel RANK function will rank them all in no time. But what if you'd like to have positive and negative numbers ranked separately? With numbers in cells A2 to A10, use one of the following formulas to get individual ranking for positive and negative values: The results will look something similar to this:\n\n To begin with, let's break down the formula that ranks positive numbers in descending order:\n• In the logical test of the IF function, you check whether the number is greater than zero.\n• If the number is greater than 0, the COUNTIF function returns the count of values higher than the number being ranked. In this example, A2 contains the 2nd highest positive number, for which COUNTIF returns 1, meaning there is just one number greater than it. In order to start our ranking with 1, not 0, we add 1 to the formula result, so it returns a rank of 2 for A2.\n• If the number is greater than 0, the formula returns an empty string (\"\"). The formula that ranks positive numbers in ascending order works a bit differently: If the number is greater than 0, the first COUNTIF gets the total count of positive numbers in the data set, and the second COUNTIF finds out how many values are higher than that number. Then, you subtract the latter from the former, and get the desired rank. In this example, there are 5 positive values, 1 of which is greater than A2. So, you subtract 1 from 5, thus getting a rank of 4 for A2. Formulas to rank negative numbers are based on a similar logic. Note. All of the above formulas ignore zero values because 0 belongs neither to the set of positive nor to the set of negative numbers. To include zeros in your ranking, replace >0 and <0 with >=0 and <=0, respectively, where the formula logic requires. For example, to rank positive numbers and zeros from largest to smallest, use this formula: How to rank data in Excel ignoring zero values As you already know, a RANK formula is Excel handles all numbers: positive, negative and zeros. But in some cases, we just want to rank cells with data ignoring 0 values. On the web, you can find a few possible solutions for this task, but the Excel RANK IF formula, methinks, is the most universal one: Where B2:B10 is the range of numbers to be ranked. The best thing about this formula is that it works beautifully both for positive and negative numbers, leaving zero values out of ranking:\n\n How this formula works\n\n At first sight, the formula may seem a bit tricky. Upon a closer look, the logic is very simple. Here's how the Excel RANK IF formula ranks numbers from largest to smallest ignoring zeros:\n• The first IF checks whether the number is 0, and if it is, returns an empty string:\n• If the number is not zero, the second IF checks whether it's greater than 0, and if it is, a regular RANK / RANK.EQ function calculates its rank:\n• If the number is less than 0, you adjust ranking by the zero count. In this example, there are 4 positive numbers and 2 zeros. So, for the largest negative number in B10, an Excel RANK formula would return 7. But we skip zeros, and therefore we need to adjust the rank by 2 points. For this, we subtract the number of zeros from the rank: Yep, it's that easy! The formula to ranks numbers from smallest to largest ignoring zeroes works in a similar manner, and it could be a good brain exercise to deduce its logic :)\n\n How to calculate rank in Excel by absolute value When dealing with a list of positive and negative values, there may be a need to rank numbers by their absolute values ignoring the sign. The task can be fulfilled with one of the bellow formulas, at the heart of which is the ABS function that returns the absolute value of a number: As the result, negative numbers are ranked as if they were positive numbers:\n\n \n\n How to get N largest or smallest values If you wish to get an actual N number of the largest or smallest values rather than their ranking, use the LARGE or SMALL function, respectively. For example, we can get the top 3 scores of our students with this formula: Where B2:B7 is the list of scores and D3 is the desired rank. Additionally, you can retrieve the students' names by using the INDEX MATCH formula (provided there are no duplicate scores in the top 3): Similarly, you can use the SMALL function to pull the bottom 3 values: That's how you do ranking in Excel.

This correction factor is appropriate both for the case where rank is computed in descending order (order = 0 or omitted) or ascending order (order = nonzero value). In the following example, RANK(A2,A1:A5,1) equals 3. The correction factor is (5 + 1 – 2 – 3)/2 = 0.5 and the revised rank that takes ties into account is 3 + 0.5 = 3.5. If number occurs only once in ref, the correction factor will be 0, since RANK would not have to be adjusted for a tie.\n\nCopy the example data in the following table, and paste it in cell A1 of a new Excel worksheet. For formulas to show results, select them, press F2, and then press Enter. If you need to, you can adjust the column widths to see all the data. Rank of 3.5 in the list above (3) Rank of 7 in the list above (5)"

Or is there a more elegant solution as a whole?"
