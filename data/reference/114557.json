        "document": "The real world of digital systems? It’s complex, mate. Full of layers of abstraction. A GCD implementation? Well, you break it down into two parts: datapath and control path. The datapath? That’s where all the functional blocks are, the guts of the operation. The control path? It manages the flow, handles the control signals — keeps everything ticking like clockwork. Simple enough when you see it, but it’s got its own kind of order.\n\nSo, the algorithm goes like this: we begin by reading two numbers, say A and B. Then, we compare these two numbers. If A is less than B, we subtract A from B, making B equal to B minus A. On the other hand, if A is greater than B, we subtract B from A, making A equal to A minus B. Now, if A is equal to B, that means we’ve reached the result.\n\nHere’s a unified explanation of each element in the datapath without breaking them into “purpose” and “operation”:\n\nPIPO Register (Parallel In Parallel Out 16-bit Register):\n\nIt is used to store the two 16-bit input numbers, A and B, simultaneously, allowing them to be processed in parallel throughout the algorithm.\n\nMultiplexers:\n\nThese are used to select and send the appropriate operands, either A or B, to the subtractor based on the comparison results, ensuring the correct value is subtracted.\n\nComparator (16-bit 2-word Comparator):\n\nThis element compares the two numbers, A and B, and produces signals indicating whether A is less than, greater than, or equal to B, guiding the next operation in the datapath.\n\nSubtractor (16-bit Subtractor):\n\nIt subtracts the appropriate value, either A from B or B from A, based on the comparison, and the result is fed back to update the respective register.\n\nBus (16-bit Data Bus):\n\nThis bus fetches input data and supplies it to the registers A and B, while also receiving the output from the subtractor to update the registers as needed, ensuring the data flow within the system.\n• ldA and ldB (Load A and Load B): These are control signals used to load the input values into registers A and B, respectively. The FSM triggers these signals when new values are fetched from the bus.\n• These are the output signals from the comparator.\n• lt (less than): Activated when A < B.\n• The FSM uses these signals to determine the next steps in the algorithm, such as deciding which number should be subtracted from the other.\n• These control signals are used to manage the multiplexers:\n• sel1: Selects the input for MUX1, which is responsible for routing the value of register A or the result from the subtractor to the next step.\n• sel2: Selects the input for MUX2, which routes the value of register B or the subtractor output.\n• sel_load: Manages the selection for loading either new data from the bus or the subtractor output into registers A or B.\n• Aout and Bout (16-bit wires from register A and B):\n• These wires feed into the multiplexers (MUX1 and MUX2), as well as the comparator.\n\n2. x and y (16-bit wires from MUX1 and MUX2 to the Subtractor):\n• x: 16-bit wire from MUX1 to the subtractor, carrying either A or the appropriate value based on FSM control.\n• y: 16-bit wire from MUX2 to the subtractor, carrying either B or the required value based on FSM control.\n• A shared 16-bit bus used for transferring input data to the PIPO registers (A and B) and receiving results from the subtractor or external sources.\n• This wire carries the result from the subtractor and is fed into MUXes and the bus as needed for updating registers A or B, based on control signals.\n\nThe FSM continuously monitors the comparator’s outputs (lt, gt, eq) and accordingly sets the control signals (ldA, ldB, sel1, sel2, sel_load) to perform the subtraction and comparison operations in sequence. It ensures the correct data flows through the wires and triggers the appropriate registers to load or update, guiding the datapath toward the final result.\n\nmodule controller(ldA, ldB, sel1, sel2, sel_load, done, lt, gt, eq, clk, start);\n\n input clk, lt, gt, eq, start;\n\n output reg ldA, ldB, done, sel_load, sel1, sel2;\n\n\n\n reg [2:0] state;\n\n parameter s0 = 3'b000, s1 = 3'b001, s2 = 3'b010, s3 = 3'b011, s4 = 3'b100, s5 = 3'b101;\n\n\n\n // Sequential state transition logic\n\n always @(posedge clk)\n\n begin\n\n case (state)\n\n s0: if (start) state <= s1;\n\n s1: state <= s2;\n\n s2: if (lt) state <= s3;\n\n else if (gt) state <= s4;\n\n else if (eq) state <= s5;\n\n s3: if (lt) state <= s3;\n\n else if (gt) state <= s4;\n\n else if (eq) state <= s5;\n\n s4: if (lt) state <= s3;\n\n else if (gt) state <= s4;\n\n else if (eq) state <= s5;\n\n s5: state <= s5;\n\n default: state <= s0;\n\n endcase\n\n end\n\n\n\n // Combinational control signal logic\n\n always @(state)\n\n begin\n\n case (state)\n\n s0: begin \n\n sel_load = 1;\n\n ldA = 1; \n\n ldB = 0; \n\n done = 0; \n\n end\n\n\n\n s1: begin \n\n sel_load = 1; \n\n ldA = 0;\n\n ldB = 1; \n\n end\n\n\n\n s2: if (lt) begin \n\n sel1 = 0; \n\n sel2=1;\n\n sel_load = 0; \n\n ldA=0; ldB = 1; \n\n end\n\n else if (gt) begin \n\n sel1 = 1; \n\n sel2 = 0; \n\n sel_load = 0;\n\n ldB=0; ldA=1; \n\n end\n\n else if (eq) \n\n done = 1;\n\n\n\n s3:if (lt) begin \n\n sel1 = 0; \n\n sel2=1;\n\n sel_load = 0; \n\n ldA=0; ldB = 1; \n\n end\n\n else if (gt) begin \n\n sel1 = 1; \n\n sel2 = 0; \n\n sel_load = 0;\n\n ldB=0; ldA = 1; \n\n end\n\n else if (eq) \n\n done = 1; \n\n \n\n s4: if (lt) begin \n\n sel1 = 0; \n\n sel2=1;\n\n sel_load = 0; \n\n ldA=0; ldB = 1; \n\n end\n\n else if (gt) begin \n\n sel1 = 1; \n\n sel2 = 0; \n\n sel_load = 0;\n\n ldB=0; ldA = 1; \n\n end\n\n else if (eq) \n\n done = 1; \n\n \n\n \n\n s5: begin \n\n done=1;\n\n ldA=0;\n\n ldB=0; \n\n end\n\n\n\n default: begin \n\n ldA = 0; \n\n ldB = 0; \n\n end\n\n endcase\n\n end\n\nendmodule"

        "document": "What are Data path and Control Paths in Digital domain ?\n\nThe data path consists of the functional units where all the computations are carried out. So essentially a data path will consist of typically some registers to store some data , multiplexers or adders, subtractors, multipliers, counters and similar functional blocks. So in a datapath part there are a lot of hardware and things which are there but we are not specifying or telling exactly what to do with those hardware. All I can tell is that there are three registers, there is one adder , one subtractor and one counter but I am not specifying within the data path that exactly how I am going to use them.\n\nSo for that there will be a second part which is called a control path . Control path is nothing but a finite state machine (FSM) which s will be generating or providing some control signals for the data path in a particular sequence. And by doing that the data path will get activated accordingly and the operations will be carried out as per the intended requirement. The control path can also take some input from the data path okay to get information of status of the process.\n\nThe first design we take in this regard is a very simple example where we are trying to multiply two integers by repeated addition. So the algorithm is like this we are let's say reading the two numbers A (multiplicand) and B (multiplier) , the product P .\n\nThe data is fed in by the data_in line to the databus. Whenever LdA, LdB control signals go HIGH, the daat from bus is taken and stored in register A and register B respectively. Initially register P, is set to 'zero' value via a control signal named clrP . Then , the data entries in A & P are fed into an Adder and the reuslt is stored back in P, whenver LdP signal goes high. The signals shown in blue are control signals .\n\n\n\nAfter each iteration, we go on decrementing B by one unit . Data entry in register B is decremented to a value of B-1 , whenever control signal decB, goes HIGH. The value of B is monitored via the help of a comparator circuit , which produces an output signal eqz. This goes HIGH if B=0, else it's held in LOW state.\n\n`timescale 1ns / 1ps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodule MUL_datapath(eqz, LdA, LdB, LdP, clrP, decB, data_in,clk);\n\n\n\ninput LdA, LdB, LdP, clrP, decB,clk;\n\ninput [15:0] data_in;\n\noutput eqz;\n\nwire [15:0] X,Y,Z,Bout, Bus;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPO1 A (Bus,LdA,clk,X); // Register for A //\n\nPIPO2 P (Z,LdP,clrP,clk,Y); // Register for P //\n\nCNTR B(Bus,LdB,decB,clk,Bout); // Down counter for B //\n\nADD AD (Z,X,Y); // Adder Module //\n\nEQZ COMP (eqz,Bout); // A comparator ,that checks if B = zero or not //\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nendmodule\n\n\n\n \n\n/*********** Comparator module for checking if B = zero or not ***************/ \n\nassign eqz = (data == 0); // eqz is assigned '1' , if data is equal to '0' // if(ld) // if load is active, load data into register of B // else if(dec) // If decrement signal is active, then decrement value of B // \n\n S3 : #2 if(eqz) state <= S4; // delay added so as to get better simulation results // \n\n #17 data_in = 17; // Value to be loaded in A (Multiplicand) // #10 data_in = 5; // Value to be loaded in B (Multiplier) // \n\n\n\n We come to an end of this post. I hope by the end of this post, reader realizes that design of complex digital designs can often by simplified by following a systematic breakdown approach into data path and control path units.\n\n For more queries you can contact me at \n\n Verilog Code | Datapath and Controller Design | Design 2 | GCD of two numbers\n\nWhenever we are trying to build a complex system , it will consist of a mix of combinational and sequential circuits. In this blog we try to come up with Verilog code for such complex systems.To begin with a basic idea, we need to understand that in any complex digital systems, the whole hardware is typically partitioned into two parts,"

        "document": "\n• Lecture 08 – Verilog Case-Statement Based State Machines\n• State Machine with High Amounts of Branching and Merging\n• Yet Another Rescheduling Example\n• This presentation includes slides for both a graduate and undergraduate course, but with very different delivery, emphasis, and expectation. The slides marked in title with a superscript circle are only for the graduate course and should be ignored for the presentation to undergradaute students.\n• A very common framework being described and implemented is a Finite State Machine with a Datapath: a designated data path controlled by signals designated FSM circuitry\n• suitable for implementation of algorithm with input and local variables stored in datapath register\n• Hardware Implementation:\n• Next-State and State Control Logic Determines next state and control signals based on registers\n• Datapath implements operations on data under control of sate control logic\n• \n• Wires and registers with specified precision and sign\n• If available customizable hardware is fast, and control logic is difficult to describe, a good mix can be software for control and hardware for calculations. We will see later approaches that use a general purpose processor for control.\n• The relate to describing a piece of hardware (or software) in a modeling language which is software.\n• 1 Neither registers nor signals can be assigned more than once during a clock cycle (covered in our Verilog code rules by the one-block assignment rule)\n• 2 No circular definitions exist between wires (i.e. no combinatorial logic loops)\n• 3 If a signal is used as an operand of an expression, it must have a known value in the same clock cycle\n• 4 All datapath outputs must be defined (assigned) during all clock cycles (in some cases a DontCare may be allowed)\n• For a general application, hardware is best for timing-critical (especially simultaneous processes and triggering events) while software is flexible and good for implementing algorithms with high complexity – in the sense of Kolmogorov complexity, the length of the code to implement the algorithm to produce some output given some inputs.\n• Remember, timing-critical can refer to predictability of timing, not just how fast it can go (a real-time system is a system with timing guarantees)\n• Datapath operations can be encoded within the same procedural code as the state machine description or can be built separately.\n• \n• Identify elements in the datapath from experience with traditional digital systems (e.g. communications modules, arithmetic modules, multiplexer’s and demultiplexers, registers and multi-word buffers, FIFOs, IP Cores etc…).\n• Identify the control signals required and the status/condition information required to make decisions on the control.\n\nState Machine with High Amounts of Branching and Merging\n• example find borg|car|cat|bot|bet|bit and output done flag where done is a registered output\n• done flag logic cannot be coded directly based on CS and with the final states\n• registered outputs in general must coded once per transistion, though the existance of one common default may save some lines of code clk CS failed found done CS recieved_a 'r' CS recieved_r_for_car done found 't' CS recieved_t done found CS failed done found\n• output logic coded with use of next state NS CS failed found done NS recieved_t done found recieved_r_for_car done found recieved_g done found failed done found done\n\nExercise: consider adding to the word list.\n• Encoding datapath operations WITHIN in the statemachine description with the controller instead of coding them in a separate block is sometimes better.\n• It is common to see “algorithmic” statemachines described with control and computation embedded in the same procedural block. These are modules which perform complex computations over multiple cycles and require internal registers/memory.\n• We’ll first focus on control state machines first, with an emphasis on timing and external status and control signals then discuss computational statemachines\n• Data-Flow Graphs represents dependencies among operations in the process of an arithmetic algorithm (more compact than a full state diagram).\n• A algorithmic state machine performs one or more operations in a state (i.e. clock cycle) while satisfying the required order dependencies from the graph\n• Ex: Draw the Datapath and Identify Status and Control as well as Pre-Register data names\n• I strongly support not using single-always-block implementations of statemachines, though the compactness of coding for presentation is one reason I used single-always-blocks in the code herein\n• Note that most moderately complex logic coded within single edge-triggered always block is essentially the same as a single-always-block FSM, even if not formalized as a case-statement-based FSM description. Therefore I find it is useful to study the single-always-block style to understand what is being implemented in such code.\n• At times we’ll want to include an extra register to store information that we don’t want to code as part of our primary state register.\n• Examples:\n• partial results in the process of a multi-cycle computation\n• saved results to provide at the output ports at a later time\n• status flags for events that should be remembered and used in later processing and state decisions\n• These extended state registers are not necessarily represented by the number of drawn states state transition diagram or the primary coded state register, but formally they ARE part of the state of the system\n\nnote the explicit state register and the additional extended state registers\n\nNote that the output and status can be based one or more of the input, NS, and other state registers.\n• Logic based on only the current state groups updates based on the current/source state, e.g. describes all output independently of transition away from the current state\n• Including the input signals makes the output/update also input-dependant\n• Including NS as a dependency selects edges based on the destination state. Note that NS itself may depend on the input. This is useful if complex parts of the output logic have already been capture in the NS logic description.\n• Using a root case statement based on NS tends to organize updates based on the destination state (transitions into state). This is useful for registered output logic.\n• Using NS useful for registered output logic.\n\nOne of the advantages of registered output design is in design partitioning and addressing the timing of a design within each partition.\n• Length of Combinatorial Paths are matched to those in the partitions\n• Length of paths is determined by factors accross partitions\n• Logic Optimizer and designer therefore have different perspectives of the design\n• Output path has underspecified timing constraint that may need to account for delays of output\n• Control FSM are commonly required to implement timing based on cycles, reading of status signals in particular cycles, and generating control signals at the appropriate time\n\nMany issues will arise in using systems that operate at different speeds, or don’t operate in a predetermined fixed timing\n• the master may assert a request until it is acknowledged\n• commonly, if a request and an ack are asserted in the same cycle, then it is assume that the data is consumed\n• for reading (e.g. results) the master may wait until a result is ready to read a response\n• a separate flag like done or data valid (presented for consumption) is common for this\n• It is common to require one or both of\n• These can be used to implement\n• Minimum wait (Fixed followed by Conditional)\n• fix delay then wait for a condition based on external input to be satisfied. This is useful when interfacing with external “slow” entities that need time after being signaled to send back a response.\n• Add “top” level wait states to state machine in each place needed\n• Use a counter\n• a) Use external counter ( implement as an external state machine) and interface to it\n• b) embed something like a counter in the coding of the state machine, thus creating substates using the counter as an extended state register.\n• Create a single programmable wait state to jump to and return to from multiple states using a “jump” register extended state register\n• Is it better to grow the state register or use a separate counter variable?\n• Example: create outer loop with 10 iterations and inner loop with 5 iterations\n• After examination of the state diagram, three required behaviors are desired: , ,\n• Note would be the output of the register, the output from the register could be called ( , , , , )\n• Wrongly using the output of a register instead of the input can be a pitfall when using single-always-block (registered outputs) and extended state registers\n• Could one just change i<10 to i<9?\n• Perhaps yes, but the reasoning is important.\n• Lets say you are working on a class HW project – if you make the wrong version, run a simulation or debug in FPGA hardware, notice that one extra loop is performed and “tweak” the code to “just make it work” without understand the options, than that would not be a good reason. You want to be cognizant of and understand the different choices, then you have the knowledge and understanding to select the most appropriate implementation. Furthermore, at some point your code will be very large and systems will be complex – expecting to make many tweaks is not a reliable approach. You want to learn to get as much right the first time as possible.\n• I’d argue that the tweaked version is less readable, but I could not say it is wrong.\n• When looking for a change on an signal, avoid a careless temptation to “detect” edges using edge specifiers if it is not warranted to create a new clock domain. Ex:\n• Consider saving a previous version of the signal in a register, and using both present and previous input values to detect a transition:\n\nwhich is the same as\n• A slave device commonly starts processes based on a start signal from a master. A slave process may be fast or slow compared to a master. For instance, an instruction processor acting as a master controlling a slave through general I/O ports. Driven by software, it the processor may require many clock cycles to respond (software bit-banging and handshaking can be slow).\n• Considering a slow master applying a command signal, yet requiring many clock cycles to respond to a handshaking signal from a slave. The slave might falsely initiate a second round of activity if the command is asserted too long.\n• To alter the behavior, a slave state machine can instead look for a change in the signal in two consecutive clock cycles\n• using a fresh high as a condition within a statemachine\n• FSM typically lack any hierarchy. There is no way to connect details of state-machines leading to state explosion. Otherwise, a hierarchy of states is quite useful for organizing an algorithm.\n• Consider two state machines. Maybe one captures user input like desired temperature, it has states, inputs and outputs appropriate to perform that task. Perhaps the other controls a heating element based on measured and desired temperature. Separated, they may be fairly simple, but what happens when they are described as a single, flat state machine?\n• A multiplicative effect in the number of states. Two three-state FSMs became one nine-state FSM\n• This motivates partitioning into multiple state machines in hardware design\n• Now, see what happens if a single new condition, a universal exception must be added.\n• A dramatic result from only one new condition. Readability and perhaps feasibility of mentally managing the FSM is severely impacted.\n• A single if statement can be added, taking advantage of the hierarchy of logic embedded in code.\n• Think about the delay examples given earlier using a counter. The counter was implementing one form of hierarchical states.\n• Consider waiting for an acknowledgment signal for clock cycles. This would require ~1 Millon states with the condition to move to the next state or proceed to end state if acknowledge was received.\n• The rigid implementation of hardware and the limited representation of FSMs do not make it very flexible model, especially if one considers run-time flexibility\n• Rigid next-state logic is replaced by a rigid next-address logic with a programmable control store.\n• Complex designs make require using/creating some form of compiler and a custom language\n• Next step towards generalization is to use a general purpose processor\n• A number of models exist for doing that, from implementing custom hardware as a slave coprocessor that implements hardware-accelerated instructions (or functions) to treating the custom hardware modules and processor as cooperative peer components.\n• Interfacing is another issue and choices depend on rigidness of interfaces and which should be the master or slave.\n• Common choices:\n• Confirm hardware design to be able attach to processor bus\n• Use general IO to interface processor to hardware\n• With respect to the processor, need to decide on interrupt or polling interface. Platforms should provide options for both for all the choices above\n• \n• Decision Diamond\n• Exit Paths\n• two or more for\n• \n• Well-defined initial state, such as single entry point with actionless path to one initial state\n• Note that registers may only be updated once per clock cycle,\n• Improper to represent multiple updates in one cycle\n• Commonly outputs are written just by name (rather than out=1), and it is assumed the unspecified outputs default to 0\n• As we are designing Multi-Cycle computations, we may consider two\n\n optimizations:\n• The following examples based on or borrowed from Thomas&Moorby\n• Multi-cycle computation:\n\n Note, the single-block style here was used since the state transition sequence is straightforward. Also, the data path is combined with the controller.\n\n We are not worried about “code bloat” from having to code each output on every transition.\n\n Instead of concentrating on\n\n timing coincidence of state and outputs\n\n vs\n\n coding coincidence of state and outputs,\n\n we are focused on the\n\n coincidence of states and computations. In this single block style the computation performed and resources required for each each are clear, though the corresponding output of each computation is seen and can be used on the cycle following the corresponding state indicated in the state register. In other words, we are interested in what update to registers is being computed and prepared in each state.\n\nSome synthesizers may do similar types of rescheduling for you.\n\n Xilinx tools command to perform a “retiming”: https://www.xilinx.com/support/answers/65410.html\n\nIn the following version, all compuation is performed in the S_2 cycle.\n\nIn this specific case we can provided a relaxed timing constraint for the paths from the output of the registers for i,j,k to the input of f. We will later learn about manipulation constraints for the synthesizer to allow for multi-cycle paths, but for now we assume that all combinational chains must complete work within a clock cycle.\n• Suggesting Resource Sharing guides the synthesizer to reuse hardware for operations at multiple places in the code\n• The coding method depends on the synthesizer tool: the following code is more likely interpreted as resource sharing since the multiplier result is always written to the same variable\n• Another option is to manually extract the multiplier out of the edge-triggered code and write datapath logic explicitly for the multiplier paired with a mux along with a state machine to change the inputs\n\nMultiplier input controlled using an explicit mux in the datapath:\n• Another variation with the mux logic embedded within the state machine\n\nMultiplier input controlled using an implied mux in the datapath, requires that data to be passed through the statemachine description block:\n\nYet Another Rescheduling Example\n• FSM Synthesizers can automatically try variations maintain input and output timing:\n• Movement of q=r*s using a new temporary register q_int:\n• Movement of f*g: using an exisinting working register g:\n• Invalid rearrangement for i+j+k consuming input k in state S_1 instead of S_2 and vice versa for input j unless the optimizer tool or designer can otherwise determine that i and j do not change in those time cycles. Input timing must be maintained just like output updates.\n• The state encoding effects the size of the decoder, speed, dependent logic optimization, etc.\n• \n• Auto: In this mode, XST tries to select the best suited encoding algorithm for each FSM.\n• One-Hot: One-hot encoding is the default encoding scheme. Its principle is to associate one code bit and also one flip-flop to each state. At a given clock cycle during operation, one and only one bit of the state variable is asserted. Only two bits toggle during a transition between two states. One-hot encoding is very appropriate with most FPGA targets where a large number of flip-flops are available. It is also a good alternative when trying to optimize speed or to reduce power dissipation.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n …\n• Gray: Gray encoding guarantees that only one bit switches between two consecutive states. It is appropriate for controllers exhibiting long paths without branching. In addition, this coding technique minimizes hazards and glitches. Very good results can be obtained when implementing the state register with T flip-flops.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n …\n• Compact: Compact encoding consists of minimizing the number of bits in the state variables and flip-flops. This technique is based on hypercube immersion. Compact encoding is appropriate when trying to optimize area.\n• Johnson: Like Gray, Johnson encoding shows benefits with state machines containing long paths with no branching.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n …\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n …\n\n rollover to all zeros\n• Sequential: Sequential encoding consists of identifying long paths and applying successive radix two codes to the states on these paths. Next state equations are minimized.\n• Speed1: Speed1 encoding is oriented for speed optimization. The number of bits for a state register depends on the particular FSM, but generally it is greater than the number of FSM states.\n• User: In this mode, XST uses original encoding, specified in the HDL file. For example, if you use enumerated types for a state register, then in addition you can use the ENUM_ENCODING constraint to assign a specific binary value to each state. Please refer to “Design Constraints” chapter for more details.\n• RAM-Based Finite State Machine (FSM) Synthesis: Large Finite State Machine (FSM) components can be made more compact and faster by implementing them in the block RAM resources provided in Virtex® devices and later technologies. FSM Style (FSM_STYLE) directs XST to use block RAM resources for FSMs.\n• One of the benefits of extracting FSMs, is that additional analysis and design checks are available:\n\n “XST can detect unreachable states in an FSM. It lists them in the log file in the HDL Synthesis step.”\n• XST can add logic to your Finite State Machine (FSM) implementation that will let your state machine recover from an invalid state. If during its execution, a state machine enters an invalid state, the logic added by XST will bring it back to a known state, called a recovery state. This is known as Safe Implementation mode.\n• By default, XST automatically selects a reset state as the recovery state. …\n• This feature is useful in system susceptible to corruption or as a way to handle undefined power-on initialization\n• One-hot encoding is good for speed and simplicity of state decoding logic and state incrementing.\n• More compact codes such as standard binary encoding generally require a smaller state state register than one-hot encoding at the possible cost of size and speed.\n• But this depends on the density of combinatorial logic vs. registers the supporting HW platform and in the design.\n• FPGAs have many registers and so the cost of additional combinatorial logic may large compared to the savings from needing less registers.\n• Codes where only one or two bits change at a time in the state register may be beneficial.\n• Less transitions may lead to less power depending on overall design, e.g. if stage register output connects to a high-capacitance load (high-fanout)\n• Can minimize the chance of metastability errors (such as systems with tight timing, or radiation vulnerability).\n• These codes may also minimize logic glitches.\n• The XST log file reports the full information of recognized Finite State Machine (FSM) components during the Macro Recognition step. Moreover, if you allow XST to choose the best encoding algorithm for your FSMs, it reports the one it chose for each FSM. \\ As soon as encoding is selected, XST reports the original and final FSM encoding. If the target is an FPGA device, XST reports this encoding at the HDL Synthesis step. If the target is a CPLD device, then XST reports this encoding at the Low Level Optimization step.\n• Most synthesizers support various instructions to modify synthesis behavior\n• Many options can be applied globally or on a per module instance or even per block level.\n• Some are entered in constraint files, as a command-line option or inline via special commented tags:\n• The comment below is an example of a synthesizer directive / inline-constraint:\n• Related constraints are:\n• fsm_fftype\n• use D or toggle flip flops for state register\n• enum_encoding\n• sets encoding when fsm_extract is used to select user\n• You should not automatically add default case to synthesize a FSM since the logic has to cover many unnecessary states\n• Special effort may be required to have the synthesizer ignore the default case yet allow logging in simulation: http://www.trilobyte.com/pdf/golson_snug94.pdf:\n• Explicit States are stored in the state register, but other registers for variables can exist serving as extended state variables\n• Technically, every register in a digital system is a part of the state. What variables you decide to think of as state in your state diagram and what is coded in the CS register and used in the case statement is up to you.\n• When there are many similar states, sometimes combining them in code and adding a register for a variable makes sense. This can reduce the state decoding and state logic and may make the code more maintainable and easier to read.\n\nExample state machine code if time allows"

        "document": "A is a block of Verilog code that implements a certain functionality. Modules can be embedded within other modules and a higher level module can communicate with its lower level modules using their input and output ports.\n\nA module should be enclosed within and keywords. Name of the module should be given right after the keyword and an optional list of ports may be declared as well. Note that ports declared in the list of port declarations cannot be redeclared within the body of the module.\n\nAll variable declarations, dataflow statements, functions or tasks and lower module instances if any, must be defined within the and keywords. There can be multiple modules with different names in the same file and can be defined in any order.\n\nThe module dff represents a D flip flop which has three input ports d , clk , rstn and one output port q . Contents of the module describe how a D flip flop should behave for different combinations of inputs. Here, input d is always assigned to output q at positive edge of clock if rstn is high because it is an active low reset.\n\nThis module will be converted into the following digital circuit during synthesis.\n\nNote that you cannot have any code written outside a module !\n\nWhat is the purpose of a module ?\n\nA module represents a design unit that implements certain behavioral characteristics and will get converted into a digital circuit during synthesis. Any combination of inputs can be given to the module and it will provide a corresponding output. This allows the same module to be reused to form bigger modules that implement more complex hardware.\n\nFor example, the DFF shown above can be chained to form a shift register.\n\nNote that the dff instances are connected together with wires as described by the Verilog RTL module.\n\nInstead of building up from smaller blocks to form bigger design blocks, the reverse can also be done. Consider the breakdown of a simple GPU engine into smaller components such that each can be represented as a module that implements a specific feature. The GPU engine shown below can be divided into five different sub-blocks where each perform a specific functionality. The bus interface unit gets data from outside into the design, which gets processed by another unit to extract instructions. Other units down the line process data provided by previous unit.\n\nEach sub-block can be represented as a with a certain set of input and output signals for communication with other modules and each sub-block can be further divided into more finer blocks as required.\n\nA top-level module is one which contains all other modules. A top-level module is not instantiated within any other module.\n\nFor example, design modules are normally instantiated within top level testbench modules so that simulation can be run by providing input stimulus. But, the testbench is not instantiated within any other module because it is a block that encapsulates everything else and hence is the top-level module.\n\nThe design code shown below has a top-level module called design. This is because it contains all other sub-modules requried to make the design complete. The submodules can have more nested sub-modules like mod3 inside mod1 and mod4 inside mod2. Anyhow, all these are included into the top level module when mod1 and mod2 are instantiated. So this makes the design complete and is the top-level module for the design.\n\nThe testbench module contains stimulus to check functionality of the design and is primarily used for functional verification using simulation tools. Hence the design is instantiated and called d0 inside the testbench module. From a simulator perspective, testbench is the top level module.\n\nA hierarchical structure is formed when modules can be instantiated inside one another, and hence the top level module is called the root. Since each lower module instantiations within a given module is required to have different identifier names, there will not be any ambiguity in accessing signals. A hierarchical name is constructed by a list of these identifiers separated by dots for each level of the hierarchy. Any signal can be accessed within any module using the hierarchical path to that particular signal."

        "document": "Verilog, a cornerstone of modern digital circuit design, epitomizes the evolution and refinement of hardware description languages (HDLs). Developed initially for describing and simulating intricate digital circuits, Verilog has become instrumental across various applications, notably in designing network switches, microprocessors, and memory units. Unlike conventional schematic-based approaches, Verilog introduces a flexible, technology-neutral format that not only streamlines the design and debugging processes but also adapts to the multifaceted layers of hardware abstraction—behavioral, register-transfer, and gate levels. The adaptability and depth of Verilog's design capabilities reflect a mature language engineered to meet the rigorous demands of modern electronic design automation (EDA), making it a useful tool in the transformation from theoretical designs to tangible, operational technology.\n\nVerilog is a Hardware Description Language (HDL) used to define and simulate digital circuits at various levels of detail. It becomes popular in network switches, microprocessors, and memory units. Unlike traditional schematics, Verilog offers a flexible, technology-neutral format that streamlines the design and debugging process. It supports multiple abstraction layers—behavioral, register-transfer, and gate levels—each suitable for different stages of hardware design.\n\nAt the behavioral level, Verilog allows developers to describe complex digital logic without detailing the physical circuitry. This abstraction models system behaviors using concurrent algorithms that run sequentially as programmed. It uses high-level constructs such as functions, tasks, and procedural blocks to define system functionalities. This level is useful for initial logic and timing verification, providing an intuitive way to articulate system operations.\n\nThe register-transfer level (RTL) focuses on data flow and operations between registers within the circuit. Verilog at this level describes how data moves through registers, the operations performed during these transfers, and how outputs are influenced by inputs. RTL coding in Verilog helps in synthesizing high-level logic into physical hardware layouts, enabling precise control over circuit functionality and optimization of data pathways and timing.\n\nThe gate level description offers a detailed view of the circuit, specifying each logic gate and its connections. This level details the logical operations and timing characteristics at the most basic level. Gate-level coding in Verilog is often automatically generated by synthesis tools and is primarily used for post-synthesis simulation and verification. This ensures that the hardware implementation adheres to the specified logic and meets performance criteria, particularly in timing and functional reliability.\n\nA key aspect of gate-level modeling is driving strength, which is the ability of a gate to drive a signal through its output terminals. Strong drive strengths are achieved with direct connections to the power source, enabling faster signal transitions and better performance in noisy environments. Weaker drive strengths, which result from connections through resistive elements, lead to slower transitions and increased noise susceptibility.\n\nDelays are another significant aspect of gate-level modeling, representing the time required for a signal to travel from the input to the output of a gate. These delays ensure accurate timing analysis and ensuring the circuit meets speed requirements. In Verilog, delays can be precisely defined to account for both rise and fall times of signals.\n\nVerilog uses a modular design strategy to simplify intricate circuit designs by breaking them down into manageable, functional sub-modules. There are two main approaches: top-down and bottom-up.\n\nIn the top-down approach, designers start with a complete view of the system and gradually break it down into detailed components. This method supports a structured design flow, making the process clearer, easier to manage, and facilitating thorough verification of each component's functionality and integration.\n\nThe bottom-up approach starts at the most basic level, where individual modules are designed and tested separately. These modules are then integrated to form more complex systems. This method promotes reusability of well-tested components and ensures robustness, as each module is verified independently before integration, reducing the risk of errors cascading through the larger system.\n\nModules simplify the design process by enabling individual components to be developed, tested, and verified in isolation before integration into larger systems. This isolation reduces complexity and minimizes the risk of errors propagating through the system. For example, a designer can develop a module for an arithmetic logic unit (ALU), thoroughly test its functionality, and then integrate it into a microprocessor design without modifying its internal structure.\n\nOne of the significant advantages of modular design is the ability to reuse modules across different projects. Once a module is created, it can be implemented in any system that requires its functionality, saving time and reducing errors from re-coding. This reuse is particularly beneficial in large projects where common functionalities, such as memory controllers or I/O interfaces, are frequently needed.\n\nModular design in Verilog also helps manage the complexity of integrating multiple functions within a single chip. Designers can assemble a sophisticated system by strategically combining modules, each responsible for a distinct part of the system’s overall functionality. This approach streamlines the development process and enhances the maintainability and scalability of the system.\n\nVerilog's syntax, influenced by the C programming language, is designed for ease of adoption by engineers with software development backgrounds. This familiarity helps in understanding and using Verilog efficiently.\n\nOne of Verilog's strengths is its support for concurrency. Non-blocking assignments enable simultaneous operations during hardware simulation, reflecting the parallel nature of hardware systems. The syntax includes features that enhance code readability and maintenance, such as whitespace management and comments. These elements help create cleaner and more understandable code, facilitating long-term project management and collaboration.\n\nVerilog is case-sensitive, making consistency in coding practices. It uses various identifiers and reserved keywords to define the structure and function of hardware components clearly. Verilog offers advanced syntax elements for effective code management. This includes precise whitespace management for better readability and debugging, and annotations within the code to guide future revisions. Verilog can handle digital representation across different numeric bases (binary, hexadecimal, decimal, and octal).\n\nVerilog's type system is utilized for accurately describing and modeling digital circuits. It offers a variety of built-in data types tailored to specific functions within hardware design and simulation.\n\nIn Verilog, 'wires' are used to connect different circuit components and transmit signals across the system. Unlike variables in traditional programming, wires do not store data. They act as conduits for transmitting signals between circuit elements, defining the pathways through which data flows within the circuit.\n\n'Registers' hold and maintain data over different cycles. They function similarly to variables in software programming, storing computed values and states needed for the circuit’s operation. Registers retain data across multiple operational cycles, enabling the circuit to perform sequential and combinative logic based on stored and current inputs.\n\nVerilog also handles special values like 'x' (unknown) and 'z' (high impedance), which are useful in specific scenarios:\n\n'x' signifies an unknown state during initial simulation stages when all values have not yet been determined. This helps identify uninitialized variables and potential design issues where outputs cannot be definitively predicted.\n\n'z' represents a high-impedance state, similar to a disconnected wire. It is used for modeling circuits with tri-state buffers or any component that can effectively disconnect itself from the circuit, thus not influencing other elements.\n\nVerilog supports detailed low-level circuit descriptions, allowing designers to model and simulate digital circuits at the transistor level. This includes defining the behavior of fundamental components like MOSFETs (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors) and CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) technology.\n\nVerilog offers designers granular control over each circuit element. This level of detail ensures that every aspect of the circuit’s operation is accurately represented and predictable. By modeling individual transistors, designers can fine-tune circuit performance and reliability.\n\nThis precision can optimize the complex designs where interactions between numerous transistors significantly influence overall functionality. Simulating these interactions helps identify potential issues early in the design process. For example, designers can detect problems such as heat generation, power inefficiencies, or signal integrity issues before physical implementation.\n\nIn Verilog, handling delays accurately ensures simulations reflect true hardware behavior, particularly in terms of timing and responses to input changes. Delays influence how signals propagate through a circuit, affecting how components interact and function. Verilog provides tools to specify and manage these delays, allowing designers to model signal travel times accurately.\n\nVerilog allows designers to define delays explicitly in the code. This capability lets designers fine-tune the timing of their simulations by specifying propagation delays for individual signals or entire logic blocks. By configuring these delays accurately, designers can predict and optimize the final hardware's performance, ensuring it meets speed and reliability requirements.\n\nVerilog’s delay management capabilities enable the modeling of complex digital interactions within a circuit, such as setup and hold times for flip-flops and other timing-sensitive components. Proper delay management helps avoid common digital design issues like race conditions and glitches, enhancing the circuit's operational stability.\n\nLogic synthesis is a process in Verilog design, transforming high-level HDL code into a detailed gate-level netlist. This conversion enables the transition from a software simulation environment to a tangible hardware implementation. Synthesis serves as the bridge that turns abstract Verilog descriptions into functional silicon chips.\n\nThe synthesis process translates the behavioral and functional specifications described in Verilog into structures that can be physically realized on a chip. This involves mapping logical expressions and operations to specific combinations of gates and circuits. Effective synthesis ensures that the design meets performance, area, and power specifications while complying with timing constraints.\n\nDuring synthesis, various optimization techniques are applied to enhance the efficiency of the resulting silicon layout. These optimizations include minimizing the number of gates used, optimizing the placement of components to reduce delay and power consumption, and ensuring that the circuit adheres to specified timing requirements.\n\nVerilog supports advanced customization, allowing designs to meet specific requirements in complex hardware scenarios. This customization is achieved through features like user-defined primitives (UDPs) and interfaces for integrating with other software languages, enhancing Verilog’s versatility.\n\nUser-defined primitives let designers create custom logic gates and other low-level structures not available in the standard Verilog library. These primitives can be tailored to meet exact performance characteristics needed for specific applications, offering control that standard components cannot. By using UDPs, designs can be optimized for speed, power consumption, or other project-specific metrics.\n\nVerilog’s interfaces for integration with software languages such as C++ and Python enable seamless interaction between Verilog hardware descriptions and software functions. This interoperability is particularly useful in scenarios where hardware and software need to closely interact, such as systems requiring hardware acceleration or in simulation and testing environments. These interfaces allow Verilog code to be simulated within software models, creating a hybrid testing environment that speeds up development and increases the robustness of the final product.\n\nVerilog integrates seamlessly with various electronic design automation (EDA) tools, creating a robust environment for design, simulation, and verification. This integration streamlines the development cycle, enhances productivity, and ensures the final product's robustness.\n\nVerilog is supported by a range of EDA tools that cover every stage of the development process, from initial design to final testing. Tools like synthesizers, place-and-route optimizers, and logic simulators convert Verilog code into a physical silicon blueprint. These tools optimize the layout for performance and area, ensuring the design behaves as expected under all conditions.\n\nEDA tools provide a feedback loop for designers, allowing early identification and rectification of potential issues. This is particularly beneficial for complex circuits where manual analysis would be time-consuming and error-prone. Simulating and verifying designs within the same framework used for creation speeds up the development process and enhances the accuracy and reliability of the final hardware.\n\nVerilog's integration with EDA tools supports various levels of abstraction, from high-level behavioral models to low-level gate simulations. This flexibility allows designers to choose the most appropriate level for each stage of development, effectively managing complex projects, adapting to changing requirements, and optimizing designs for specific applications.\n\nVerilog and VHDL are both powerful hardware description languages (HDLs), each serving different preferences and requirements within the design community due to their distinct syntactic styles and design philosophies.\n\nVerilog is known for its simplicity and flexibility, making it popular in the ASIC design domain. Its C-like syntax allows for easier adoption and quicker learning, which is ideal for rapid development and prototyping. Designers favor Verilog for its straightforward approach, which speeds up the design process.\n\nVHDL, in contrast, features a more rigorous and verbose syntax. This makes it suitable for applications requiring detailed and explicit design descriptions, such as those in aerospace and military industries. VHDL's strong typing and extensive range of data types provide higher levels of abstraction and precise control over hardware behavior.\n\nThe choice between Verilog and VHDL often depends on project-specific needs and regional preferences. VHDL is more prevalent in Europe and among companies involved with government and defense contracts. Verilog, on the other hand, dominates the commercial and rapid-prototyping sectors in North America and parts of Asia. Each language offers unique advantages that can impact the efficiency and outcome of a project, influencing the decision-making process for teams and individual designers.\n\nVerilog's development and widespread adoption stem from its user-friendly design and syntax, which is similar to the C programming language. This approachability has made it attractive to newcomers in education and digital circuit design, easing the transition from theory to practical application. Consequently, Verilog quickly became a standard tool in electronic design automation (EDA), known for its efficiency in designing complex circuitry and its accessibility to a broad range of users.\n\nVerilog was developed in the early 1980s to enhance productivity in circuit design and testing. Over time, it has adapted to meet the increasing complexities of semiconductor and system design. Its role in fostering innovation is evident from its widespread use in designing microprocessors, communication devices, and consumer electronics, all of which demand high reliability and performance optimization.\n\nAs Verilog matured, it not only enhanced its core capabilities but also expanded its interoperability with other technologies. This adaptability has reinforced its position as a foundational tool in the EDA industry. The language's robust community support has ensured that it remains relevant, evolving to meet new challenges and technological advances in circuit design.\n\nThe comprehensive capabilities of Verilog underscore its role in shaping the field of electronic design automation. From its user-friendly syntax influenced by the C programming language to its robust modular design framework, Verilog facilitates a seamless transition from high-level abstract modeling to precise low-level circuit implementations. This transition is supported by advanced features such as user-defined primitives and effective tool integration, which streamline the design process and enhance the functional integrity of the final products.\n\nAs Verilog continues to evolve, it remains at the forefront of technological advancements, adapting to new challenges and expanding its functionalities to meet the increasing complexities of semiconductor and system design. Through its practical applications and historical significance, Verilog not only enriches educational pursuits but also empowers professionals to achieve exceptional efficiency and reliability in digital design, maintaining its status as an asset in the ever-evolving landscape of technology.\n\nVerilog coding is considered to have a moderate learning curve, especially for those with a background in software development. Its syntax is similar to C, which can make it more accessible to programmers familiar with that language. However, the ease of learning Verilog also depends on one's understanding of digital circuit design concepts. For a newcomer to digital design, mastering Verilog might require a significant effort in understanding both the language and the hardware concepts it describes.\n\nVerilog is an HDL, or Hardware Description Language, distinct from VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language), which is another type of HDL. Both are used to model and simulate electronic systems but differ in syntax and some capabilities. Verilog tends to be favored for its simpler syntax and flexibility, making it popular in the ASIC design community, whereas VHDL is often used where a more rigorous descriptive style is required, such as in defense and aerospace applications.\n\n3. Is Verilog Still Used?\n\nYes, Verilog is still widely used in the electronics industry. It remains a standard tool for designing and simulating digital logic circuits, particularly in the fields of ASIC and FPGA development. Its continuous updates and the development of SystemVerilog (an extension of Verilog) have kept it relevant in addressing modern digital design challenges.\n\n4. Which is the Easiest Coding Language?\n\nThe \"easiest\" coding language can vary based on personal background and what you aim to achieve. For general software development, languages like Python are often recommended due to their straightforward syntax and readability. For hardware design and simulation, however, Verilog might be easier for those who already have some background in similar areas or C-like languages.\n\n5. Can I Use Logic in Verilog?\n\nAbsolutely, using logic operations is a fundamental aspect of Verilog. The language provides a rich set of logical operators (such as AND, OR, NOT, XOR) that are used to write expressions that reflect the logic of digital circuits. These operators help in describing the behavior of gates and modules within a circuit, making Verilog a powerful tool for designing complex logical operations and control structures within hardware designs."
