To do this, follow these steps:\n• Open Microsoft Visual Studio and Manage NuGet Packages from the menu to open package manager\n• Search for “aspose” or “aspose.words” to find the desired Aspose API\n\n\n\nThe selected API will be downloaded and referenced in your project.\n\nYou can also update Aspose.Words for .NET to the desired version using Manage NuGet Packages.\n\nYou can also install or update Aspose.Words for .NET APIs using the Package Manager Console. To do this, follow these steps:\n• Open Microsoft Visual Studio and Package Manager Console from the menu to open package manager console\n• Type the command and press Enter to install the latest full release into your application\n\n \n\n In addition, you can add the suffix to the command to specify that the latest release, including hotfixes, should also be installed.\n• Once downloaded, you will see confirmation messages\n\n \n\n If you are unfamiliar with the Aspose EULA , it is recommended to read the license referenced in the URL.\n• Now you may find that Aspose.Words has been successfully added and referenced in your application for you\n\n\n\nIn Package Manager Console, you can also use the command to check for updates to the Aspose.Words package and install them if present. You can also add the suffix to update the latest release.\n\nAspose.Words for .NET can be installed by direct downloading the MSI installer from the downloads section.\n\nYou must be logged in to download the installer. If you are not registered yet, you can may sign up for free.\n\nTo Install Aspose.Words for .NET, follow these steps:\n• Doble-click the downloaded file, thereby starting the setup wizard, follow the setup wizard instructions\n• When the setup wizard completes the installation, the required files will be available in the folder at the provided folder path\n• Right-click your project in Solution Explorer and add the reference to installed assemblies\n• Aspose.Words for .NET installed assemblies will appear in extensions under the Assemblies section – just select the required DLL component\n\n\n\nAll Aspose .NET components are recommended to run with the Full Trust permission set. This is because Aspose .NET component sometimes needs access to registry settings and files located in places other than the virtual directory, such as reading fonts. Furthermore, components are based on core .NET system classes, some of which also require Full Trust permission to run in some cases.\n\nInternet Service Providers hosting multiple applications from different companies mostly enforce Medium Trust security level. In the case of .NET 2.0, such a security level may impose the following constraints, which may affect the ability of Aspose.Words to perform properly:\n• RegistryPermission is not available. This means that you cannot access the registry, which is required to enumerate installed fonts when rendering documents.\n• FileIOPermission is restricted. This means that you can only access files in your application’s virtual directory hierarchy. This also potentially means fonts cannot be read during export.\n\nFor these reasons specified above, it is recommended to run Aspose.Words with Full Trust permissions. You may find that some of library features will work when performing different tasks with Medium trust, and some will not, for example, rendering. This can be related to GDI+ image processing calls."

What I think happens when we use GetText is that it returns text which only includes footer text from 1st page in S1 but body text is returned from all pages in that section, similar thing happens for S2 and S3. So essentially I am getting footer for only first page for all 3 sections.\n\n We want the text from all 6 pages where the text also includes the footer text as well in that string.\n\nCould you help me in understanding how we can achieve that?\n\n I am attaching a sample document with this ticket."
