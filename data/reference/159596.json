I read this tutorial (in french sorry) which was written in 2011. It uses different function names (zip_dir_add is zip_add_dir etc..)\n\nI think that might be due to the installation process. Or maybe I forgot to include some files..\n\nHere is what i have done so far :\n\n1)installing the libzip library using ubuntu packages like this :\n\n2) trying it on simple code\n\nThis returns : zip_dir_add was not declared in this scope\n\nAny idea what could cause that ?"
