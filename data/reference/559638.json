Many computers have automatic “noise reduction” or “signal enhancements”, this is a problem for the ScoreCloud audio analysis. Turn it off by going to your microphone settings, this can improve the results greatly! Playing or singing clearly and organically generally gives better results. ScoreCloud Studio does not know any songs – it attempts to analyze the musical structure like someone who never heard the song or musical style before. ScoreCloud Studio does not know what your foot is tapping! If you play or sing something that really needs accompaniment you will probably get an unexpected score, unless you record with a click-track (available for MIDI-recording, for audio recording this is not available, please use the ’Tap Beat’ feature). Keeping a steady pulse helps. Singing with da-de-dum etc. is easier for ScoreCloud to understand than lyrics. You generally get better results from singing if you sing without lyrics since there can be unclear note onsets (the start of a note) in vocal performance with lyrics. Give the starts of notes with hard consonants, for example ”da-de-dum” Sing or play fast songs a little slower and leave out ornamentation or ‘wailing’. Short notes are generally not so clear in intonation and can be difficult to separate from slides and noise. Experiment with the placement of the microphone and listen to your sound. You generally get better results if you do not sing, whistle or play very loud close to the microphone or too soft far from the microphone, but it depends also on the background noise and the reverberation in the room. If you want the a notation be rhythmically simple, try not to cut-off or prolong phrase endings too much; let the beat continue and keep the duration of the notes. Also, a mistake in the middle of a song can give consequences for the remaining song, so it’s faster recording only the verse well, and then recording the chorus in the same way and merging them afterwards. Also, check out the video tutorials Edit Rhythm and Edit Rhythm 2 – Drag Barlines. Make a long enough recording! Since ScoreCloud does not know what song you are singing it needs more than just a few notes, measures or phrases to give you a good notation. Try and sing a little longer than just a few seconds. Be clear and firm when pressing the keys of your piano or midi-keyboard. ScoreCloud analyses velocity (how “hard” you press a key) as well, and this is the same for both audio and midi recording. Since midi keyboards often don’t deliver very detailed information on velocity being clear improves the analysis. For a demonstration of the tips on the audio input in ScoreCloud Studio, look at the General tips for best possible results from the ScoreCloud audio analysis under ScoreCloud Express! Check out the video tutorials to learn more about how to change the analysis results.\n\nHow do I upgrade from ScoreCleaner to ScoreCloud?\n\nHow do I use ScoreCloud Songwriter?\n\nI’m having audio issues, what to do?\n\nScoreCloud Songwriter did not produce the sheet I wanted.

        "document": "In this guide you will learn how to edit a score in ScoreCloud Songwriter.\n\nHere are the steps covered in this guide:\n• 1. Playback & Display – Evaluate the song and identify what you need to edit\n• 2. Time & Rhythm – Make sure that the bars line up\n• 4. Notes Editing – Fix the pitch and rhythm of individual notes\n• 8. Print, Share and Export – Get your sheet in multiple formats\n\nRead or watch the chapters below, or watch all chapters in one video.\n\nYou can search this page with + (on mac: + ) to find specific answers.\n\nWelcome to this guide for ScoreCloud Songwriter. If you are trying out the program and wondering “how does this work?“, then this guide is for you. We will go through the basics of ScoreCloud Songwriter to help you evaluate your automatic lead sheets and get you up to speed on editing your score.\n\nScoreCloud Songwriter was created for acoustic instruments and vocals, but it can also work for larger bands. The program separates vocals from instruments and notates vocal melody and chords. It cannot notate different instruments into separate voices just yet.\n\nAfter recording or importing audio, ScoreCloud Songwriter generates a lead sheet for you. While this is a great starting point, some editing is usually necessary.\n\nIn this guide, we will walk you through the steps of editing and fixing a sheet in ScoreCloud Songwriter.\n\nAfter getting an automatic sheet, we want to identify what is correct and what is not in the score.\n\nChoose what you want to hear and what you want to see in the Sheet tab. A good way to start is to:\n\nEnabling the Drum Pattern, changing it to Metronome, can help you place barlines. By default the drums will follow the original timing of your recording, but you can switch to straight linear timing by clicking the conductor icon next to the Play button.\n\nNow press play and listen to the song while following along in the sheet.\n\nYou can adjust volumes in the mixer to hear more of for example the Accompaniment Rec. You can also change the instrument of the MIDI Melody to make it easier to follow the written melody and see where you need to edit.\n\nAll instruments are transcribed into a piano staff. Enabling the Accomp. Notation can help you identify downbeats, for example by looking at the lowest bass notes.\n\nTry different combinations of Playback and Display to see what works for your needs.\n\nNext we will look at how to fix the issues we identified!\n\nThe first thing to check in your automatic sheet is Time & Rhythm, to make sure that the bars line up correctly. We’re looking at the big picture here, so rhythms of individual notes come later in the note editing step.\n\nWhile editing, remember that you can always Undo multiple steps back by pressing + (on mac: + ).\n\nWe’ll use the Playback settings from the previous step and listen to the song.\n\nWe start by making sure that the Time Signature is correct. Change the time signature by double-clicking it, or by going to Time & Rhythm in the Song tab.\n\nIn the Time & Rhythm dialog you can also double and halve all the note values. The score will sound the same but you might want it notated with eighth notes instead of quarter notes. You can even change it to triple time if you for example got note values in 3/4 but want to write in 9/8 instead.\n\nIf the song has time changes, you can insert new time signatures by right-clicking in the score and selecting Insert Here -> Time Change.\n\nSometimes the program can misunderstand where the downbeat is, for example hearing the third beat as the first one. You can shift the music relative to the barlines using the Pickup tool.\n\nMake sure that the first downbeat is in the correct position in the bar. Showing the Accomp. Notation can help if there is an instrumental intro.\n\nIf the program misunderstands a downbeat in the middle of the song, you can fix this by dragging barlines. Click and drag a barline to the correct position and all following bars will be re-calculated. If there is no melody note on the downbeat, showing the Accomp. Notation can help you find the correct position of the barlines.\n\nSome measures can be hard to fix by dragging barlines. If one barline is off, but the following bars are correct, you can fix this later by moving notes within the bars.\n\nGo through the song to make sure the bars are correct, and you are done with this step!\n\nRemove unwanted bars by selecting them and going to the Notes tab, or by pressing backspace twice.\n\nYou chould now have a song that is metrically correct!\n\nNext up, key signatures and transposition!\n\nWe need to make sure that the key signature and transposition is correct. Listen to the song and identify the root.\n\nThe melody usually ends on the root, and you can see the name of the selected note in the Notes tab.\n\nGo to Transpose in the Song tab and change the key signature (without moving the notes) to the correct one.\n\nIf the song has key changes, you can insert new key change by right-clicking in the score and selecting Insert Here -> Key Change.\n\nIn the Transpose dialog you can also transpose the song (change key and move notes) to a key that suits you better.\n\nYou might also want to write the song in a different octave. Select all notes in a part by clicking to the left of the clef, or select all notes with + (on mac: + ) and move the selection a full octave with + or + (on mac: + or + ).\n\nWhile editing, remember that you can always Undo multiple steps back by pressing + (on mac: + ).\n\nListen to your song with the MIDI Melody turned on and see where you want to change the melody notation.\n\nClick and drag notes up or down to change the pitch. You can also select a note and use the and arrow keys to move the notes.\n\nMove the selected note(s) in half steps, altering the note, by holding the Alt key while dragging or by pressing + or + .\n\nMove selected note(s) a full octave by pressing + or + (on mac: + / + ).\n\nYou can use the and arrow keys to go to the next and previous note. Stepping through the notes, moving them up and down is a fast way to edit.\n\nYou can change all notes of the same pitch at the same time by selecting a note and pressing + + (on mac: + + ) to Select Similar before moving. Select Similar multiple times to select notes with that same pitch in all octaves and voices.\n\nIf a pitch has the wrong spelling, say a C# note that you want as a Db, select a note and press to do an enharmonic shift.\n\nChange the timing of a note by clicking and dragging it left and right.\n\nShorten and prolong a note by holding the Alt key while dragging left and right. A note can only be prolonged up to the next note.\n\nChange the rhythm of a set of notes by selecting them and using the Rhythm Dropdown under the Notes tab. This is a fast way of creating and removing triplets.\n\nChange the subdivision of a selection in the Rhythm Dropdown, or by pressing + , , , or . This will use the original timing to snap notes to that number of notes per beat. If your song has many unwanted triplets or sixteenths, snap them to eights by selecting a beat or an area and changing subdivision to 2.\n\nNotes are automatically split, tied and beamed based on the time signature. You can manually tie notes by pressing , and you can change beaming by right-clicking the note and going to Beam.\n\nSelect one or more notes and remove with backspace.\n\nSelecting and removing rests with backspace will extend the previous note. + extends the next note instead, moving it backwards.\n\nIf two notes are notated as one, select and split a note using the dropdown under the Notes tab.\n\nNew notes can also be added by dragging them in from the notes palette in the Notes tab, or by double-clicking a rest.\n\nThe Actions panel in the Notes tab show you actions for the selected element(s). With a note selected, you find symbols for vibratos, slides, bends as well as courtesy accidentals, quarter-tones and more.\n\nYou can also right click a note or other element to change beaming, stem direction, notehead shape, color and more.\n\nNow we’ll get to fixing the chord symbols above the notes.\n\nStart by generating New Auto Chords based on the edits you have made, using the button in the Song tab.\n\nEnable the chord pattern playback and choose a playback style to listen to the song and identify what chords you want to change.\n\nEdit a chord symbol by double-clicking it and typing a new chord.\n\nYou can also press to enable chord symbol input and select a chord position.\n\nMove to the next chord position with the key, and to the previous chord position with + . Chord positions are each beat and above each note.\n\nChoose between chord spellings, related chords and tensions by selecting a chord and clicking the Chord dropdown under the Notes tab.\n\nWith all the notes in the correct places, let’s edit the lyrics.\n\nEdit by double-clicking a lyric and typing a new word. You can also select a note and press the key to add lyrics.\n\nContinue writing by typing a space to go to the next word. You can also move to the next lyric position with the Tab key, and to the previous with + . Lyrics can be entered under each note.\n\nYou can split a word over several notes by writing a dash to create a melisma. Type a dash in the middle of an existing word to move the rest of the word to the next note, as long as the next note doesn’t already have lyrics.\n\nExtend the ending of a word with a melisma over several notes by writing underscores under the following notes.\n\nAdd a new line of lyrics by pressing the key. You can create up to six verses this way.\n\nThe last editing is the finishing touches to make the sheet look good.\n\nEdit the Title, Composer and Lyricist fields at the top of the score by double-clicking and typing. Change the font and size of the selected words in the Actions panel under the Notes tab. Your title can be multiple lines with different fonts and sizes.\n\nChoose what parts of the song should be displayed under Display in the Sheet tab.\n\nChange the overall score size and and spacing by going to Layout under the Song tab.\n\nHere you can also show margins so that you can move them by clicking and dragging.\n\nChange the spacing between individual systems and staves by clicking to the left of the clef and dragging up and down.\n\nInsert manual system breaks in the notation by selecting a barline and pressing , or by looking at the Actions panel under the Notes tab with a barline selected. This way you can get for example four bars per line.\n\nUse system breaks, note size, spacing and margins to make the score look good on the paper.\n\nYou can now print the score from the file menu.\n\nChange what parts of the song are included under Playback and Display in the Sheet tab. You can print the melody, export just the lyrics and chords to PDF, or create an mp3 without the vocals as a karaoke track.\n\nYou can also export the song into multiple formats.\n• Export as a PDF from the Print dialog (On Windows, use the Microsoft Print to PDF printer. On Mac, choose Export -> PDF from the File menu)\n• Export to an audio file to share and listen as an mp3 or Wav file.\n• Export as an image file to share on social media or in presentations.\n• Export to MIDI to import into a DAW to continue working on the production.\n• Export as a MusicXML to open in other music software.\n\nYou can share your song in the My ScoreCloud interactive web player by signing in to your ScoreCloud account on my.scorecloud.com. The online player cannot yet play synced audio tracks from ScoreCloud Songwriter, but with the interactive MIDI playback you can change the key, tempo and voices in the browser. Set the song sharing to “Anyone with the link” and paste the web address in a message. Or embed the whole player on your website!\n\nThat’s it for this Quick-start Guide.

Many computers have automatic “noise reduction” or “signal enhancements”, this is a problem for the ScoreCloud audio analysis. Turn it off by going to your microphone settings, this can improve the results greatly! Playing or singing clearly and organically generally gives better results. ScoreCloud Studio does not know any songs – it attempts to analyze the musical structure like someone who never heard the song or musical style before. ScoreCloud Studio does not know what your foot is tapping! If you play or sing something that really needs accompaniment you will probably get an unexpected score, unless you record with a click-track (available for MIDI-recording, for audio recording this is not available, please use the ’Tap Beat’ feature). Keeping a steady pulse helps. Singing with da-de-dum etc. is easier for ScoreCloud to understand than lyrics. You generally get better results from singing if you sing without lyrics since there can be unclear note onsets (the start of a note) in vocal performance with lyrics. Give the starts of notes with hard consonants, for example ”da-de-dum” Sing or play fast songs a little slower and leave out ornamentation or ‘wailing’. Short notes are generally not so clear in intonation and can be difficult to separate from slides and noise. Experiment with the placement of the microphone and listen to your sound. You generally get better results if you do not sing, whistle or play very loud close to the microphone or too soft far from the microphone, but it depends also on the background noise and the reverberation in the room. If you want the a notation be rhythmically simple, try not to cut-off or prolong phrase endings too much; let the beat continue and keep the duration of the notes. Also, a mistake in the middle of a song can give consequences for the remaining song, so it’s faster recording only the verse well, and then recording the chorus in the same way and merging them afterwards. Also, check out the video tutorials Edit Rhythm and Edit Rhythm 2 – Drag Barlines. Make a long enough recording! Since ScoreCloud does not know what song you are singing it needs more than just a few notes, measures or phrases to give you a good notation. Try and sing a little longer than just a few seconds. Be clear and firm when pressing the keys of your piano or midi-keyboard. ScoreCloud analyses velocity (how “hard” you press a key) as well, and this is the same for both audio and midi recording. Since midi keyboards often don’t deliver very detailed information on velocity being clear improves the analysis.

        "document": "In this guide you will learn how to edit a score in ScoreCloud Songwriter.\n\nHere are the steps covered in this guide:\n• 1. Playback & Display – Evaluate the song and identify what you need to edit\n• 2. Time & Rhythm – Make sure that the bars line up\n• 4. Notes Editing – Fix the pitch and rhythm of individual notes\n• 8. Print, Share and Export – Get your sheet in multiple formats\n\nRead or watch the chapters below, or watch all chapters in one video.\n\nYou can search this page with + (on mac: + ) to find specific answers.\n\nWelcome to this guide for ScoreCloud Songwriter. If you are trying out the program and wondering “how does this work?“, then this guide is for you. We will go through the basics of ScoreCloud Songwriter to help you evaluate your automatic lead sheets and get you up to speed on editing your score.\n\nScoreCloud Songwriter was created for acoustic instruments and vocals, but it can also work for larger bands. The program separates vocals from instruments and notates vocal melody and chords. It cannot notate different instruments into separate voices just yet.\n\nAfter recording or importing audio, ScoreCloud Songwriter generates a lead sheet for you. While this is a great starting point, some editing is usually necessary.\n\nIn this guide, we will walk you through the steps of editing and fixing a sheet in ScoreCloud Songwriter.\n\nAfter getting an automatic sheet, we want to identify what is correct and what is not in the score.\n\nChoose what you want to hear and what you want to see in the Sheet tab. A good way to start is to:\n\nEnabling the Drum Pattern, changing it to Metronome, can help you place barlines. By default the drums will follow the original timing of your recording, but you can switch to straight linear timing by clicking the conductor icon next to the Play button.\n\nNow press play and listen to the song while following along in the sheet.\n\nYou can adjust volumes in the mixer to hear more of for example the Accompaniment Rec. You can also change the instrument of the MIDI Melody to make it easier to follow the written melody and see where you need to edit.\n\nAll instruments are transcribed into a piano staff. Enabling the Accomp. Notation can help you identify downbeats, for example by looking at the lowest bass notes.\n\nTry different combinations of Playback and Display to see what works for your needs.\n\nNext we will look at how to fix the issues we identified!\n\nThe first thing to check in your automatic sheet is Time & Rhythm, to make sure that the bars line up correctly. We’re looking at the big picture here, so rhythms of individual notes come later in the note editing step.\n\nWhile editing, remember that you can always Undo multiple steps back by pressing + (on mac: + ).\n\nWe’ll use the Playback settings from the previous step and listen to the song.\n\nWe start by making sure that the Time Signature is correct. Change the time signature by double-clicking it, or by going to Time & Rhythm in the Song tab.\n\nIn the Time & Rhythm dialog you can also double and halve all the note values. The score will sound the same but you might want it notated with eighth notes instead of quarter notes. You can even change it to triple time if you for example got note values in 3/4 but want to write in 9/8 instead.\n\nIf the song has time changes, you can insert new time signatures by right-clicking in the score and selecting Insert Here -> Time Change.\n\nSometimes the program can misunderstand where the downbeat is, for example hearing the third beat as the first one. You can shift the music relative to the barlines using the Pickup tool.\n\nMake sure that the first downbeat is in the correct position in the bar. Showing the Accomp. Notation can help if there is an instrumental intro.\n\nIf the program misunderstands a downbeat in the middle of the song, you can fix this by dragging barlines. Click and drag a barline to the correct position and all following bars will be re-calculated. If there is no melody note on the downbeat, showing the Accomp. Notation can help you find the correct position of the barlines.\n\nSome measures can be hard to fix by dragging barlines. If one barline is off, but the following bars are correct, you can fix this later by moving notes within the bars.\n\nGo through the song to make sure the bars are correct, and you are done with this step!\n\nRemove unwanted bars by selecting them and going to the Notes tab, or by pressing backspace twice.\n\nYou chould now have a song that is metrically correct!\n\nNext up, key signatures and transposition!\n\nWe need to make sure that the key signature and transposition is correct. Listen to the song and identify the root.\n\nThe melody usually ends on the root, and you can see the name of the selected note in the Notes tab.\n\nGo to Transpose in the Song tab and change the key signature (without moving the notes) to the correct one.\n\nIf the song has key changes, you can insert new key change by right-clicking in the score and selecting Insert Here -> Key Change.\n\nIn the Transpose dialog you can also transpose the song (change key and move notes) to a key that suits you better.\n\nYou might also want to write the song in a different octave. Select all notes in a part by clicking to the left of the clef, or select all notes with + (on mac: + ) and move the selection a full octave with + or + (on mac: + or + ).\n\nWhile editing, remember that you can always Undo multiple steps back by pressing + (on mac: + ).\n\nListen to your song with the MIDI Melody turned on and see where you want to change the melody notation.\n\nClick and drag notes up or down to change the pitch. You can also select a note and use the and arrow keys to move the notes.\n\nMove the selected note(s) in half steps, altering the note, by holding the Alt key while dragging or by pressing + or + .\n\nMove selected note(s) a full octave by pressing + or + (on mac: + / + ).\n\nYou can use the and arrow keys to go to the next and previous note. Stepping through the notes, moving them up and down is a fast way to edit.\n\nYou can change all notes of the same pitch at the same time by selecting a note and pressing + + (on mac: + + ) to Select Similar before moving. Select Similar multiple times to select notes with that same pitch in all octaves and voices.\n\nIf a pitch has the wrong spelling, say a C# note that you want as a Db, select a note and press to do an enharmonic shift.\n\nChange the timing of a note by clicking and dragging it left and right.\n\nShorten and prolong a note by holding the Alt key while dragging left and right. A note can only be prolonged up to the next note.\n\nChange the rhythm of a set of notes by selecting them and using the Rhythm Dropdown under the Notes tab. This is a fast way of creating and removing triplets.\n\nChange the subdivision of a selection in the Rhythm Dropdown, or by pressing + , , , or . This will use the original timing to snap notes to that number of notes per beat. If your song has many unwanted triplets or sixteenths, snap them to eights by selecting a beat or an area and changing subdivision to 2.\n\nNotes are automatically split, tied and beamed based on the time signature. You can manually tie notes by pressing , and you can change beaming by right-clicking the note and going to Beam.\n\nSelect one or more notes and remove with backspace.\n\nSelecting and removing rests with backspace will extend the previous note. + extends the next note instead, moving it backwards.\n\nIf two notes are notated as one, select and split a note using the dropdown under the Notes tab.\n\nNew notes can also be added by dragging them in from the notes palette in the Notes tab, or by double-clicking a rest.\n\nThe Actions panel in the Notes tab show you actions for the selected element(s). With a note selected, you find symbols for vibratos, slides, bends as well as courtesy accidentals, quarter-tones and more.\n\nYou can also right click a note or other element to change beaming, stem direction, notehead shape, color and more.\n\nNow we’ll get to fixing the chord symbols above the notes.\n\nStart by generating New Auto Chords based on the edits you have made, using the button in the Song tab.\n\nEnable the chord pattern playback and choose a playback style to listen to the song and identify what chords you want to change.\n\nEdit a chord symbol by double-clicking it and typing a new chord.\n\nYou can also press to enable chord symbol input and select a chord position.\n\nMove to the next chord position with the key, and to the previous chord position with + . Chord positions are each beat and above each note.\n\nChoose between chord spellings, related chords and tensions by selecting a chord and clicking the Chord dropdown under the Notes tab.\n\nWith all the notes in the correct places, let’s edit the lyrics.\n\nEdit by double-clicking a lyric and typing a new word. You can also select a note and press the key to add lyrics.\n\nContinue writing by typing a space to go to the next word. You can also move to the next lyric position with the Tab key, and to the previous with + . Lyrics can be entered under each note.\n\nYou can split a word over several notes by writing a dash to create a melisma. Type a dash in the middle of an existing word to move the rest of the word to the next note, as long as the next note doesn’t already have lyrics.\n\nExtend the ending of a word with a melisma over several notes by writing underscores under the following notes.\n\nAdd a new line of lyrics by pressing the key. You can create up to six verses this way.\n\nThe last editing is the finishing touches to make the sheet look good.\n\nEdit the Title, Composer and Lyricist fields at the top of the score by double-clicking and typing. Change the font and size of the selected words in the Actions panel under the Notes tab. Your title can be multiple lines with different fonts and sizes.\n\nChoose what parts of the song should be displayed under Display in the Sheet tab.\n\nChange the overall score size and and spacing by going to Layout under the Song tab.\n\nHere you can also show margins so that you can move them by clicking and dragging.\n\nChange the spacing between individual systems and staves by clicking to the left of the clef and dragging up and down.\n\nInsert manual system breaks in the notation by selecting a barline and pressing , or by looking at the Actions panel under the Notes tab with a barline selected. This way you can get for example four bars per line.\n\nUse system breaks, note size, spacing and margins to make the score look good on the paper.\n\nYou can now print the score from the file menu.\n\nChange what parts of the song are included under Playback and Display in the Sheet tab. You can print the melody, export just the lyrics and chords to PDF, or create an mp3 without the vocals as a karaoke track.\n\nYou can also export the song into multiple formats.\n• Export as a PDF from the Print dialog (On Windows, use the Microsoft Print to PDF printer. On Mac, choose Export -> PDF from the File menu)\n• Export to an audio file to share and listen as an mp3 or Wav file.\n• Export as an image file to share on social media or in presentations.\n• Export to MIDI to import into a DAW to continue working on the production.\n• Export as a MusicXML to open in other music software.\n\nYou can share your song in the My ScoreCloud interactive web player by signing in to your ScoreCloud account on my.scorecloud.com. The online player cannot yet play synced audio tracks from ScoreCloud Songwriter, but with the interactive MIDI playback you can change the key, tempo and voices in the browser. Set the song sharing to “Anyone with the link” and paste the web address in a message. Or embed the whole player on your website!\n\nThat’s it for this Quick-start Guide.
