The URL for notifications must be set on your shop settings page.\n\nMost API calls are done using the Client class. It takes your shopId and secretKey in the constructor:\n\nIn order to use async/await, create an AsyncClient:\n\nAsyncClient contains the same methods as Client, with the \"Async\" suffix. The following example uses Client.\n\nThe sample code below implements taking a payment as detailed in the Quick Start guide:\n\nFor the full code, see the ASP.NET WebForms sample project.\n\nThe Nuget package contains versions for three platforms:\n• .NET 4.0: no async / await and hence no class AsyncClient.\n• .NET Standard 2.0: This version will fit most modern project types.\n\nThe required version is chosen automatically for you when you install the Nuget package. Installation instructions can be found on the nuget.org page.\n\nThe package will be created in the folder.\n\nThe package version is set by the <Version> tag in Yandex.Checkout.V3.csproj and follows SemVer.\n\n\"Authentication failed because the remote party has closed the transport stream.\"\n\nIf you get this error while trying to create a new payment, it may mean that you are using a security protocol that YC does not support. Currently (July 2018) it supports TLS 1.2 but that may change in the future. Add this code before the create payment request:\n\nOr, if you are targeting .NET 4.0 or lower:\n\nPost your question, suggestion or issue here\n\nIf you would like to work on one of the open issues, please indicate this first by commenting on the issue.
