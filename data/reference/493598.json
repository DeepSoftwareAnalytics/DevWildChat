        "document": "This module implements pseudo-random number generators for various distributions.\n\nFor integers, there is uniform selection from a range. For sequences, there is uniform selection of a random element, a function to generate a random permutation of a list in-place, and a function for random sampling without replacement.\n\nOn the real line, there are functions to compute uniform, normal (Gaussian), lognormal, negative exponential, gamma, and beta distributions. For generating distributions of angles, the von Mises distribution is available.\n\nAlmost all module functions depend on the basic function , which generates a random float uniformly in the half-open range . Python uses the Mersenne Twister as the core generator. It produces 53-bit precision floats and has a period of 2**19937-1. The underlying implementation in C is both fast and threadsafe. The Mersenne Twister is one of the most extensively tested random number generators in existence. However, being completely deterministic, it is not suitable for all purposes, and is completely unsuitable for cryptographic purposes.\n\nThe functions supplied by this module are actually bound methods of a hidden instance of the class. You can instantiate your own instances of to get generators that don’t share state.\n\nClass can also be subclassed if you want to use a different basic generator of your own devising: see the documentation on that class for more details.\n\nThe module also provides the class which uses the system function to generate random numbers from sources provided by the operating system.\n\nReturn a random element from the non-empty sequence seq. If seq is empty, raises . Return a k sized list of elements chosen from the population with replacement. If the population is empty, raises . If a weights sequence is specified, selections are made according to the relative weights. Alternatively, if a cum_weights sequence is given, the selections are made according to the cumulative weights (perhaps computed using ). For example, the relative weights are equivalent to the cumulative weights . Internally, the relative weights are converted to cumulative weights before making selections, so supplying the cumulative weights saves work. If neither weights nor cum_weights are specified, selections are made with equal probability. If a weights sequence is supplied, it must be the same length as the population sequence. It is a to specify both weights and cum_weights. The weights or cum_weights can use any numeric type that interoperates with the values returned by (that includes integers, floats, and fractions but excludes decimals). Weights are assumed to be non-negative and finite. A is raised if all weights are zero. For a given seed, the function with equal weighting typically produces a different sequence than repeated calls to . The algorithm used by uses floating-point arithmetic for internal consistency and speed. The algorithm used by defaults to integer arithmetic with repeated selections to avoid small biases from round-off error. Changed in version 3.9: Raises a if all weights are zero. To shuffle an immutable sequence and return a new shuffled list, use instead. Note that even for small , the total number of permutations of x can quickly grow larger than the period of most random number generators. This implies that most permutations of a long sequence can never be generated. For example, a sequence of length 2080 is the largest that can fit within the period of the Mersenne Twister random number generator. Return a k length list of unique elements chosen from the population sequence. Used for random sampling without replacement. Returns a new list containing elements from the population while leaving the original population unchanged. The resulting list is in selection order so that all sub-slices will also be valid random samples. This allows raffle winners (the sample) to be partitioned into grand prize and second place winners (the subslices). Members of the population need not be hashable or unique. If the population contains repeats, then each occurrence is a possible selection in the sample. Repeated elements can be specified one at a time or with the optional keyword-only counts parameter. For example, is equivalent to . To choose a sample from a range of integers, use a object as an argument. This is especially fast and space efficient for sampling from a large population: . If the sample size is larger than the population size, a is raised. Changed in version 3.11: The population must be a sequence. Automatic conversion of sets to lists is no longer supported.\n\nThe following functions generate specific real-valued distributions. Function parameters are named after the corresponding variables in the distribution’s equation, as used in common mathematical practice; most of these equations can be found in any statistics text. Return the next random floating-point number in the range Return a random floating-point number N such that for and for . The end-point value may or may not be included in the range depending on floating-point rounding in the expression . Return a random floating-point number N such that and with the specified mode between those bounds. The low and high bounds default to zero and one. The mode argument defaults to the midpoint between the bounds, giving a symmetric distribution. Beta distribution. Conditions on the parameters are and . Returned values range between 0 and 1. Exponential distribution. lambd is 1.0 divided by the desired mean. It should be nonzero. (The parameter would be called “lambda”, but that is a reserved word in Python.) Returned values range from 0 to positive infinity if lambd is positive, and from negative infinity to 0 if lambd is negative. Changed in version 3.12: Added the default value for . Gamma distribution. (Not the gamma function!) The shape and scale parameters, alpha and beta, must have positive values. (Calling conventions vary and some sources define ‘beta’ as the inverse of the scale). Normal distribution, also called the Gaussian distribution. mu is the mean, and sigma is the standard deviation. This is slightly faster than the function defined below. Multithreading note: When two threads call this function simultaneously, it is possible that they will receive the same return value. This can be avoided in three ways. 1) Have each thread use a different instance of the random number generator. 2) Put locks around all calls. 3) Use the slower, but thread-safe function instead. Changed in version 3.11: mu and sigma now have default arguments. Log normal distribution. If you take the natural logarithm of this distribution, you’ll get a normal distribution with mean mu and standard deviation sigma. mu can have any value, and sigma must be greater than zero. Normal distribution. mu is the mean, and sigma is the standard deviation. Changed in version 3.11: mu and sigma now have default arguments. mu is the mean angle, expressed in radians between 0 and 2*pi, and kappa is the concentration parameter, which must be greater than or equal to zero. If kappa is equal to zero, this distribution reduces to a uniform random angle over the range 0 to 2*pi. Weibull distribution. alpha is the scale parameter and beta is the shape parameter.\n\n# Even integer from 0 to 100 inclusive ['four', 'two', 'ace', 'three'] # of 52 playing cards, and determine the proportion of cards # Estimate the probability of getting 5 or more heads from 7 spins # of a biased coin that settles on heads 60% of the time. # Probability of the median of 5 samples being in middle two quartiles Example of statistical bootstrapping using resampling with replacement to estimate a confidence interval for the mean of a sample: Example of a resampling permutation test to determine the statistical significance or p-value of an observed difference between the effects of a drug versus a placebo: # Example from \"Statistics is Easy\" by Dennis Shasha and Manda Wilson 'at least as extreme as the observed difference of leads us to reject the null' 'hypothesis that there is no difference between the drug and the placebo.'

All such numbers are evenly spaced and are exactly representable as Python floats. However, many other representable floats in that interval are not possible selections. For example, isn’t an integer multiple of 2⁻⁵³. The following recipe takes a different approach. All floats in the interval are possible selections. The mantissa comes from a uniform distribution of integers in the range 2⁵² ≤ mantissa < 2⁵³. The exponent comes from a geometric distribution where exponents smaller than -53 occur half as often as the next larger exponent. All real valued distributions in the class will use the new method: The recipe is conceptually equivalent to an algorithm that chooses from all the multiples of 2⁻¹⁰⁷⁴ in the range 0.0 ≤ x < 1.0. All such numbers are evenly spaced, but most have to be rounded down to the nearest representable Python float. (The value 2⁻¹⁰⁷⁴ is the smallest positive unnormalized float and is equal to .)

        "document": "In this lesson, you will learn how to shuffle a list in Python using the function. Also, learn how to shuffle string, dictionary, or any sequence in Python.\n\nWhen we say shuffle a list, it means a change in the order of list items. For example, shuffle a list of cards.\n\nYou’ll learn the following functions of a random module to randomize a list in Python.\n\nThe function takes two parameters. Out of the two, is an optional parameter.\n• : It is a sequence you want to shuffle such as list.\n• : The optional argument random is a function returning a random float number between 0.1 to 1.0. This function decides how to shuffle a sequence. If not specified, by default Python uses the function. \n\nNote: this parameter deprecated since version 3.9, will be removed in version 3.11\n\nIt shuffles sequence in place and doesn’t return anything, i.e., It returns None. This function changes the position of items in a mutable sequence.\n\nNote: As you can see in the output, the positions of list items are changed.\n\nAs you know, the works in place and returns None, i.e., it changes the order of items in the original list randomly. But most of the time, we need the original list or sequence.\n\nWe can keep the original list intact using the following two ways. These options don’t modify the original list but return a new shuffled list.\n\nMake a copy of the original list before shuffling (Ideal and preferred)\n\nOption 2: Shuffle list not in Place using\n\nUse the function to shuffle list not in place to get the new shuffled list in return instead of changing the original list\n\nThe random.sample() function returns the random list with the sample size you passed to it. For example, will return a list of 3 random items from a list.\n\nIf we pass the sample size the same as the original list’s size, it will return us the new shuffled list.\n\nLet’s see the example. In this example, I am shuffling the list of Employee objects.\n\nWaring: As per the official Python documentation, for small , the total number of permutations of can quickly grow more extensive than the period of most random number generators. This implies that most permutations of a long sequence can never be generated. For example, a sequence of length 2080 is the largest that can fit within the Mersenne Twister random number generator period. So I advise you to use the use first approach.\n\nShuffle Two Lists At Once With Same Order\n\nLet’s assume if you want to Shuffle two lists and maintain the same shuffle order. For example, One list contains employee names, and the other includes a salary. Let’s see how to randomize multiple lists by maintaining their order.\n\nNumPy module has a package to generate random data. In this example, I am using Python’s Numpy module to create a 2d array. Also, Using function, we can shuffle the multidimensional array.\n\nShuffle a List to Get the Same Result Every time\n\nLet’s how to seed the random generator in such a way that shuffling produces the same result every time. Using the and together, we can generate the same shuffled list every time.\n\nDo you know how PRNG works in Python?\n\nPython’s random module is not truly random. It is pseudo-random (PRNG), i.e., deterministic. The random module uses the seed value as a base to generate a random number. By default, current system time is used as a seed value. If we change the seed value, we can change the output.\n\nNote: We are getting the same list because we use the same seed value before calling the shuffle function. This is just a simple example. To make it work with any list, we need to find the exact seed root number for that list, which will produce the output we desire.\n\nIn this section, we will see how to shuffle String in Python. But it is not as simple as shuffling a list. You will get an error if you try to shuffle a string using the method.\n\nBecause a string is an immutable type, and You can’t modify the immutable objects in Python. The doesn’t’ work with String. I.e., It can’t accept string argument. Let’s understand this with the help of the following example.\n\nWe have a solution to this. We can shuffle a string using various approaches. Let see each one by one.\n\nShuffle a String by Converting it to a List\n\nConvert String to list and Shuffle the list randomly, again convert the shuffled list into String\n\nApproach Two: Shuffling a String, not in place\n\nUsing this approach, we can keep the original string unchanged and get the new shuffled string in return. Also, we don’t need to convert the string to a list to get the shuffled string.\n\nThe sample() function returns a sample from a sequence as per the sample size you passed to it. For example, will return a list of 3 random characters from a list.\n\nIf we pass the sample size the same as the string size, it will return us the new shuffled string of characters.\n\nThe doesn’t return the list, so when you try to run , you will get an error. To shuffle numbers in the , first convert the range to a .\n\nShuffling a dictionary is not possible in Python. However, we can rearrange the order of keys of a dictionary.\n• Fetch all keys from a dictionary as a list.\n• Shuffle that list and access dictionary values using shuffled keys.\n\nThe needs to know the sequence’s size to shuffle the sequence uniformly. If you try to shuffle a generator object using it, you will get a TypeError: the object of type 'generator' has no len() .\n\nAs the generator cannot provide us the size we need to convert it into a list to shuffle it.\n\nI want to hear from you. What do you think of this article on ? Or maybe I missed one of the usages of . Either way, let me know by leaving a comment below.\n\nAlso, try to solve the following exercise and quiz to have a better understanding of working with random data in Python."

        "document": "Program for Round Robin Scheduling for the Same Arrival Time\n\nRound Robin is a CPU scheduling algorithm where each process is cyclically assigned a fixed time slot. It is the preemptive version of the First come First Serve CPU Scheduling algorithm.\n\nThis article focuses on implementing a Round Robin Scheduling Program where all processes have the same arrival time. In this scenario, all processes arrive at the same time which makes scheduling easier. You can focus on the main logic of dividing CPU time equally and managing the process queue.\n\nCharacteristics of Round Robin CPU Scheduling Algorithm with Same Arrival Time\n\nBelow are the key characteristics of the Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm when all processes share the same arrival time:\n• Equal Time Allocation: Each process gets an equal and fixed time slice (time quantum) to execute, ensuring fairness.\n• Cyclic Execution: Processes are scheduled in a circular order, and the CPU moves to the next process in the queue after completing the time quantum.\n• No Process Starvation: All processes are guaranteed CPU time at regular intervals, preventing any process from being neglected.\n• Same Start Time: Since all processes arrive at the same time, there is no need to consider arrival time while scheduling, simplifying the process.\n• Context Switching: Frequent context switching occurs as the CPU moves between processes after each time quantum, which can slightly impact performance.\n\nExample of Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm for the Same Arrival Time\n\nHow to Compute Below Times in Round Robin Using a Program?\n• Completion Time: Time at which process completes its execution.\n• Waiting Time(W.T): Time Difference between turn around time and burst time. \n\nWaiting Time = Turn Around Time – Burst Time\n\nProgram for Round Robin Scheduling with Arrival Time as 0 for all Processes\n\nSteps to find waiting times of all processes\n\nOnce we have waiting times, we can compute turn around time tat[i] of a process as sum of waiting and burst times, i.e., wt[i] + bt[i].\n\nBelow is implementation of above steps.\n\n// C++ program for implementation of RR scheduling // Function to find the waiting time for all // until all of them are not done. // Traverse all processes one by one repeatedly // If burst time of a process is greater than 0 // then only need to process further // Increase the value of t i.e. shows // how much time a process has been processed // If burst time is smaller than or equal to // quantum. Last cycle for this process // Increase the value of t i.e. shows // how much time a process has been processed // As the process gets fully executed // If all processes are done // Function to find waiting time of all processes // Function to find turn around time for all processes // Display processes along with all details // Method to find the waiting time for all // until all of them are not done. // Traverse all processes one by one repeatedly // If burst time of a process is greater // than 0 then only need to process further // Increase the value of t i.e. // shows how much time a process has // If burst time is smaller than or // equal to quantum. Last cycle for this // Increase the value of t i.e. // shows how much time a process has // minus time used by this process // As the process gets fully // If all processes are done // Function to find waiting time of all processes // Function to find turn around time for all // Display processes along with all details # robin manner until all of them are # Traverse all processes one by # If burst time of a process is greater # than 0 then only need to process further # Increase the value of t i.e. shows # how much time a process has been processed # If burst time is smaller than or equal # to quantum.

It is simple to implement but can lead to higher context-switching overhead. While it promotes fairness and prevents starvation, it may result in longer waiting times and reduced throughput, depending on the time quantum. Effective program implementation allows for the calculation of key metrics like completion time, turnaround time, and waiting time, aiding in performance evaluation and optimization.\n\nProgram for Round Robin Scheduling for the Same Arrival Time – FAQs\n\nRound Robin assigns each process with a fixed time quantum during which it can execute on the CPU. Once the time quantum expires, the next process in line is allocated the CPU for its turn. No process can run for more than one quantum while others are waiting in the ready queue. If a process needs more CPU time to complete after exhausting one quantum, it goes to the end of ready queue to await the next allocation. This cyclical distribution ensures that each process gets an equal opportunity to utilize the CPU.\n\nWhat are the advantages of round robin scheduling algorithm?"

        "document": "Round Robin Scheduling is one of the most popular CPU scheduling algorithms used in operating systems. This algorithm is designed to handle processes efficiently by assigning a fixed time slice or quantum to each process.\n\nHowever, when processes arrive at different times, the scheduling becomes slightly more complex but remains true to its principles. In this article, we’ll explore how the Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm effectively handles this situation. Also, we’ll see its program implementation.\n\nCharacteristics of RR Scheduling Algo with Different Arrival Time\n• Handles Dynamic Arrival : Processes can arrive at different times, and the scheduler dynamically adds them to the ready queue as they arrive, ensuring no process is overlooked.\n• Time Quantum Distribution : Each process is allocated a fixed time slice (time quantum) for execution, regardless of its arrival time.\n• Preemptive Execution : If a process doesn’t complete within its time quantum, it is preempted and added back to the queue for its next turn, even if new processes have arrived.\n• Fair Scheduling : Even with different arrival times, all processes are treated fairly, and no process is given priority over others by default.\n• Minimizes Starvation : New processes are regularly added to the queue, and the algorithm ensures that all processes get CPU time, reducing the risk of starvation.\n• Efficient Queue Updates : The ready queue is updated dynamically as new processes arrive, maintaining a circular queue structure for smooth execution.\n• Impact on Turnaround and Waiting Time : Processes arriving later may experience slightly increased waiting times, but the algorithm works to minimize delays by rotating through all tasks.\n\nExample of Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm for the Different Arrival Time:\n\nAfter all these we get the three times which are:\n• Completion Time: the time taken for a process to complete.\n• Turn Around Time: total time the process exists in the system. (completion time – arrival time).\n• Waiting Time: total time waiting for their complete execution. (turn around time – burst time ).\n\nHow to implement in a programming language\n• None Declare arrival[], burst[], wait[], turn[] arrays and initialize them. Also declare a timer variable and initialize it to zero. To sustain the original burst array create another array (temp_burst[]) and copy all the values of burst array in it.\n• None To keep a check we create another array of bool type which keeps the record of whether a process is completed or not. we also need to maintain a queue array which contains the process indices (initially the array is filled with 0).\n• None Now we increment the timer variable until the first process arrives and when it does, we add the process index to the queue array.\n• None Now we execute the first process until the time quanta and during that time quanta, we check whether any other process has arrived or not and if it has then we add the index in the queue (by calling the fxn. queueUpdation()).\n• None Now, after doing the above steps if a process has finished, we store its exit time and execute the next process in the queue array. Else, we move the currently executed process at the end of the queue (by calling another fxn. queueMaintainence()) when the time slice expires.\n• None The above steps are then repeated until all the processes have been completely executed. If a scenario arises where there are some processes left but they have not arrived yet, then we shall wait and the CPU will remain idle during this interval.\n\nBelow is the implementation of the above approach:\n\n//adds the incoming process to the ready queue Enter the arrival time of the processes : \" Enter the burst time of the processes : \" //Incrementing Timer until the first process arrives //Checking and Updating the ready queue until all the processes arrive //If a process is completed then store its exit time //and mark it as completed //checks whether or not CPU is idle //after each premption in the ready Queue \"\n\nEnter the arrival time of the processes : \" \"\n\nEnter the burst time of the processes : \" //Incrementing Timer until the first process arrives //Updating the ready queue until all the processes arrive //checks whether or not CPU is idle //Maintaining the entries of processes after each premption in the ready Queue //adds the index of the arriving process(if any) # adds the index of the arriving process(if any) Enter the arrival time of the processes :\" Enter the burst time of the processes :\" # Incrementing Timer until the first process arrives # Updating the ready queue until all the processes arrive # checks whether or not CPU is idle # Maintaining the entries of processes aftereach premption in the ready Queue # This code is contributed by lokeshmvs21. // for not effecting the actual array // these condition for if // arrival is not on zero // check that if there come before qtime // is any have less arrival time // according to ith is process // if no process is come on the critical // for exit the while loop // This code is contributed by Rajput-Ji //adds the incoming process to the ready queue //Incrementing Timer until the first process arrives // Checking and Updating the ready queue until all the processes arrive // If a process is completed then store its exit time // and mark it as completed // checks whether or not CPU is idle //after each premption in the ready Queue // This code is contributed by akashish_.\n\nIn case of any queries or a problem with the code, please write it in the comment section.\n\nNote: A slightly optimized version of the above-implemented code could be done by using Queue data structure as follows:\n\n// the amount of CPU time remaining after each execution * At every time quantum or when a process has been executed before the time quantum, * check for any new arrivals and push them into the queue // checking if any processes has arrived // if so, push them in the ready Queue. * At every iteration, the burst time of the processes in the queue are handled using this method // if the process is going to be finished executing, // ie, when it's remaining burst time is less than time quantum // mark it completed and increment the current time // and calculate its waiting time and turnaround time // if all the processes are not yet inserted in the queue, // then check for new arrivals // the process is not done yet. But it's going to be pre-empted // since one quantum is used // but first subtract the time the process used so far // if all the processes are not yet inserted in the queue, // then check for new arrivals // insert the incomplete process back into the queue * Just a function that outputs the result in terms of their PID. * This function assumes that the processes are already sorted according to their arrival time // initially, pushing the first process which arrived first // holds the current time after each process has been executed // holds the number of programs executed so far \"Enter arrival time and burst time of each process \" // At every time quantum or when a process has been // executed before the time quantum, check for any new // arrivals and push them into the queue // checking if any processes has arrived // if so, push them in the ready Queue. // At every iteration, the burst time of the processes // in the queue are handled using this method // if the process is going to be finished executing, // ie, when it's remaining burst time is less than // time quantum mark it completed and increment the // current time and calculate its waiting time and // if all the processes are not yet inserted in // the queue, then check for new arrivals // the process is not done yet.
