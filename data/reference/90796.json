        "document": "China’s top messaging app WeChat rolled out something quite radical: mini-programs. Embedded apps which require no download, no install. Open, use, share, done!\n\nThere is large debate – and many clickbaits – about how practical these apps are... Indeed the framework provided to developers is only at infancy stage, still limited, and honestly a bit frustrating. Nevertheless Tencent is investing unprecedented resources into the adoption of this channel, building momentum, and opening opportunities to the first-movers. We believe that these hackers may find quick-wins if they dare to give it a try.\n\nGot ideas of services you would like to deploy in WeChat asap? Have basic knowledge of Javascript and want to experiment with this framework? Got lost in the Google translation of the doc? Need a small boost to decrypt what is possible or not? Hello and welcome.\n\nFinding your way through the official doc is not easy. In fact, it requires a lot of trial/errors, some research on open-source code and many assumptions to get something done. You have been banging your head on the wall. We get it.\n\nOur mission is to help creative entrepreneurs build great tech products. We will help you take the small steps.\n\nThe content below is not a translation of the documentation and will surely be outdated fast. It is simply our contribution to help any one get started and build a cool WeChat Mini-program fast. Do it now.\n\nAre you working on a mini-program? Do reach out to us if you’d like to share your work, meet our crew, ask for help!\n\nIf you want to contribute, you can send a Pull Request here or give us a shout on shanghai(at)lewagon.com for suggestions!\n\nThis original piece was written by Le Wagon alumni: Adrien Pelegri (Batch #30) with the support of Thibault Genaitay (Driver China) and Stephane Delgado (Batch #61).\n• The life cycle of your MP\n• Create dynamic pages\n• Enable the forward button of the drop-down menu\n\nThe registration process is really tough, especially if you don’t have any experience with the fantastic Chinese administrative world. The WeChat verification process will be long. Keep your calm.\n\nFrom the WeChat mini-program registration, until the development release, you basically need to go through these steps:\n• Pick the right type of application and go through the registration process.\n\nHere is a list of materials you will need to register a mini-program as a company:\n• Chinese ID. This person will own the account and scan QR codes a lot.\n• Phone number, to certify your identity during the verification process.\n• Chinese business license, to register as an enterprise.\n• Fill in the official letter Tencent provides, sign it (by the admin) and stamp it with the enterprise stamp. Upload it.\n\nWe recommend you follow this comprehensive English manual on how to register and create a mini-program project: Medium article or check this official WeChat documentation (Chinese).\n\nAn IDE (integrated development environment) is a set of programming tools for writing an application. It consists of a code editor, a compiler and a debugger, accessible through a single graphical user interface.\n\nHere is a quick tutorial to master the WeChat IDE and take the most from it.\n\nA Code editor with the tree of your files on the side and a Simulator on the left, which displays the preview of your app.\n\nHere is a complete list of buttons to perform tasks when you are in development:\n\n1. Profile: click on it to log out from the IDE. 2. Code Editing 3. Debug / Inspect: see below. 4. Project information: see below. 5. Compiler: Can be usefull to compile the app when the auto-refresh of the view is not working.\n\n6. Scene value\n\n 7. Cache\n\n 8. Shut down: Quit the project you are on and move toward another one.\n\n 9. Hide the simulator\n\n 10. Devices: It gives a list of devices to test mini-program responsivness.\n\n 11. You can work on: wifi, 4G, 3G, 2G.\n\n 12. Hide arborescence\n\n 13. Manage your files: Search, add and delete a folder or a file.\n\nDebugger / Inspector: This tool is an important part of the IDE, it looks like the good old Chrome DevTools.\n\n1. Top bar ​\n\n Network: This panel is to debug request and socket issues or page load performance.\n\n Storage: allows to access all the data you have in your cache.\n\n AppData: is used to display the current project data. You can directly edit the data in the panel and preview it.\n\n Wxml: let you inspect and edit on the fly every elements of your page.\n\n Sensor: you can simulate location and the performance of the mobile device to debug gravity sensing.\n\n3. Console The console will let you know what errors you have in your code by logging diagnostic information and interact with javascript in the page as your console.log() you have placed and more.\n\nProject information: This page is where you will find the current project details as your AppID, directory information and more. By clicking on the preview option you will be able to test the mini-program directly on your phone after scanning a QR code.\n\nNote: While you are testing your mini-program on your phone, you can enable the debugger tool directly on your device.\n\nThis section will introduce the structure of the \"quickstart\" provided by WeChat (boilerplate) and the fundamentals you need to comply with this framework.\n\nThe index page of this boilerplate displays a welcome page with the current user profile's information. A click on your avatar will redirect to a new page displaying your current mini-program logs.\n\nWeChat mini-programs start with \"app\" files (see the screenshot below). These files are the mini-program root directory therefore the entrance of your mini-program. (Here is the official WeChat documentation).\n\napp.js is the script code, the global logic of your mini-program. You can setup and manipulate the life cycle functions of your MP, declare global variables or call an API.\n\napp.json is the global configuration of the overall mini-program. You can configure, MP (mini-program) page’s path, the MP window style, set the network timeout and debug configuration.\n\nNote: Comments are not allowed in the app.json file.\n\napp.wxss is the global style sheet of the mini-program. You should declare common style rules here. ​\n\nThe two pages of WeChat quickstart are:\n• index page which is the welcome page.\n\nPages folder is where you have or create your mini-program pages. Each page you create is required to contain two files:\n• .js file for the logic of your interface.\n\nYou can add two more files in each page you create:\n• .wxss file for the style sheet of your interface. ​ Rule: Each page of your mini-program can be composed of four different file extensions (js ; json ; wxml ; wxss) but should have the same name.\n\nFurther details: A new page will always contain a .js file and a .wxml file minimum. The .json file extension is used just in case you want to override the window configuration in this particular page. Add .wxss if you want to add a style sheet to your page.\n\nLet's see what happens in each page of the quickstart project.\n• The snippet above assigns the app instance to a variable. This app instance will be called in function later on to collect user information.\n• Next it registers a function and sets to dynamically bind data into the view.\n• function redirects the current user to his logs page.\n• First it requires util.js in the purpose of calling later on.\n• function retrieves current user logs from the cache . Then render logs in which is provided by the require of util.js.\n\nIn Utils are stored imported libraries that you may require elsewhere (in our example, util.js is required in log.js). In the code snippet above, the function is defined in util.js to properly display the date of your logs.\n\nUp to now you catch the fact that you will have two layers in each page:\n• Logical layer (.js): process the data and send it to the view layer, while receiving events triggered from the view layer.\n• View layer (.wxml/.wxss): display the data processed by the logical layer into a view, while sending the events of the view layer to the logical layer.\n\nWe can break-down a mini-program life cycle in two cycles, the application cycle and the page cycle. The life cycle is the start & end point of the mini-program whereas life cycle is activated when users browse through the mini-program.\n\nfunction is used to register a mini-program. It takes an object as parameter which specifies the life cycle functions of a MP.\n• A user opens the mini-program which triggers function and initialize the MP.\n• When the initialization is completed, the function is triggered.\n• The function is triggered when the current user exits the mini-program.\n\nWeChat framework offers a global function called which is an instance of .\n\nfunction, can be useful for the simple reason that you can’t define the function inside of a function. In order to access the app instance you must call function.\n\nfunction is used to register a page. It accepts an object as a parameter, that specifies the initial data for the page, life cycle functions, event handler and so on.\n• After page registration, the framework calls the function.\n• When a page loads, it calls the function.\n• The first time the page is displayed, function calls to render the view.\n• The is triggered when the mini-program jumps to another page.\n• function is called when you quit a page by using and . Or when the current page is relaunched, .\n\nWhen the life cycle is complete, the page loads by calling for the first time, and will only call it once.\n\nWhen the mini-program is running from the background (app life cycle) to the foreground (page life cycle), it first calls the function and then calls the function when switching to the foreground.\n• function cannot be reused and should be register once in the app.js.\n• Do not call when the page is not yet generated.\n• By using you can obtain an instance of App() but lifecycle functions don’t attempt to call the functions.\n\nThe setup of your mini-program is simple and designed to save you time and frustration when having customization needs.\n\nWeChat divides the app.json configuration in five parts:\n\nIn this part we will break-down this complete app.json setup exemple.\n\nrole in app.json is to define all routes of your mini-program. This item's configuration is mandatory and it takes an array of strings. Each sub-folder and files within the parent pages folder corresponds to a routing path.\n\nTip:\n\n Each time you add a route path to , the IDE will automatically create the folder and files that corresponds to the path you just created.\n• Initialization: Once the mini-program is launched, the first page is loaded by and function.\n• Open a new page: Opening a new page hides the current page and jumps to another one using the . Behind the scene the first page will be hidden by the call of the onHide function and jump over the other page by calling onLoad and onShow.\n• Page redirection: Close the current page by calling onUnload and jumps to a page within the app using which call onLoad and onShow functions.\n• Page return: the current page, calls function and then displays the target page by calling .\n• Reloading, : Close all pages and reloads the current page. *Does not work on certain andriod devices.\n• Switch tabs, : Jumps from one tabBar page to another one and close or hides all other non-tabBar pages by using onUnload, onHide and onShow. Discover all possible scenarios for tabs switching.\n• No callback at the top of the page.\n• The tabBar path cannot take parameters.\n• , can only open a non-tabBar page. - can only open and display tabBar page. - can be used for every pages.\n• The tabBar at the bottom of the page is displayed according to the page you are on. As long as the page you are on is defined in the tabBar, the tabBar will be display.\n• Page stack modification will lead to routing and page status error, it is not recommended. Dig further in pages stack mecanism.\n\n: This function is used to get the instance of the current page stack. It is given as an array in the page stack order. The first item of the array is the first page and the last item the current page.\n\nas the name suggests, is the item which configures the top or bottom tab bar. is an array which accomodates a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 5 tabs.\n\nUsing the key, requires an object in each element of the array.\n• Setting your position to top could not display icons.\n• The limit size of your icons in the bottom are, 40kb, 81px*81px.\n\nThe window item is used to set mini-program title and common window style.\n\nneeds to be configured in the global app.json as above and then you can call in mini-program pages.\n\nCode snippet of the \"Enable pull down refresh in a page\" file.\n\nWeChat offers the possibility to change the title of the top navigation bar within each page.\n\nNetwork timeout may be provided in a variety of network requests. Here is the link to the WeChat documentation if you want to go further.\n\nHere is a link to the WeChat documentation.\n\nWXML is a WeChat markup language similar to HTML. It combines a basic library of components and an event system to build dynamic pages.\n\nThe WeChat event system behaves like classic Javascript events which handle logical responses to the view layer.\n\nThe table below lists the significant differences you will face in development between WXML / HTML:\n\nis not a component, it is only a packaging element, it will not do any rendering in the page and only accept control properties.\n\nNote: All components and attributes are lowercase.\n\nThe Mini-program framework does not allow developers to use the DOM to control your WXML elements. Instead, you will update your view layer (.wxml file) via data binding method:\n\nIn order to comply with WeChat requirements the attribute has to be initialized in JSON format within function. Data binding technique allows to update data dynamically within the view layer.\n\nA good practice is to initialize at the top of the function.\n\nThe dynamic which is passed over to the view layer is taken from the data attributes in the corresponding function.\n\nData binding syntax:\n\n Data binding uses Mustache syntax (double braces) to wrap variables. This syntax is a logic less template engine analysis. In short, it is very convenient and easy to use!\n\nWeChat offers lot of possibilities regarding data binding usage. You have the oportunity to use data binding on component attributes, properties, string operations, arithmetic operations, data path and array.\n\nThe control property binds an array from your logical layer (.js file), loops through it and assigns the data.\n\nSimilar to you can use to render multiple lines block. (See block in the WXML table above).\n\nFor more details on the code above see this Github repository.\n• For more details about list rendering refer to WeChat documentation .\n\nSimilar to , is used to define a conditional statement and determine whether the block should be rendered or not.\n\nIf you want to display more than one tag within your conditional statement block you can use .\n\nTemplates allow to define code snippets you want to reuse several times in different files of your mini-program.\n\nWXML template item has its own scope and can only use data to pass in.\n\nFirst, to declare a template you need to define its name.\n\nLater on if you want to call a template within the same file use the attribute and the template name as a value to declare the required template. And don't forget to pass data to the template using the attribute.\n\nTo declare a template already defined in a new file you first need to import it.\n\nCode snippet \"import and call the template in index.wxml\" exemple\n\nMore details on the WeChat documentation here.\n\nIn addition to data initialization and life cycle functions, the framework allows to define event handling functions.\n\nWXML element (event handler) triggers the event and the logical layer binds the event handler to receive an event object as a parameter.\n\n: This function updates data within the logical layer which next will be send to the view layer. function receives an object as a parameter and updates the key value by using as a data path.\n\nThere are many kind of binding events, most components have their own definition of binding event.\n\nThe two common binding events used are and . The catch event is the one that prevent against bubbling events.\n\nBubbling event concept:\n\n For non-javascript folks, bubbling event can be defined when an event occurs in an element nested in another element. Both the parent node and the nested elements are registered as event handler for that particular event. The parent node of the nested element should use , which will prevent the event from bubbling to ancestor elements.\n\nMostly used when you nest elements and don’t want to display the parent node of the element you bind.\n\nHere are practical tips to enable the mini-program sharing. WeChat opens up two ways to share a mini-program:\n• Possibility to enable the forward button within the drop-down menu that appears by clicking on the upper right corner of the page.\n• Create a forward button within the page of your mini-program. It makes the sharing process more user friendly.\n\nIn both variants, the framework will automatically forward a mini-program card with a screen shot of your MP header.\n\nTo enable this button we need to use a function called .\n\nCode snippet \"Enable the forward button of the drop-down menu\" example.\n\nIn this function you have to define a title that will be displayed on the top of the forward card and the current page path. If you forget to add a title WeChat will add one by default (your mini-program name).\n\nRestriction: The only thing that you can define in this case is the event . The forward button will be created by the framework itself.\n\nThis feature allows developers to create a specific forward button within the page by using the button property and its value .\n\nCode snippet \"Create a forward button within the page\" example.\n\nUnlike the first case, we have to create the event handler that triggers the function. This function calls and pass as a parameter.\n\nNote: Both variants are using a function which implies that you are sharing the specific page where you declare the function.\n\nWeChat aims to build a friendly, efficient and consistent user experience. To make it happen WeChat official design team provides a WeUI repository. This basic front-end library (WeUI) is consistent with WeChat native visual experience. WeUI, can be understood as a WeChat front-end library, similar to Bootstrap. It includes a large set of components such as button, cell, dialog, progress, toast, article, actionsheet, icon and more.\n\nThe downloaded code contains WeUI source code and a mini-program sample based on WeUI.\n\nImport WeUI style in your app.wxss to enable the use of WeUI style in your mini-program:\n\nFor more details regarding WeChat design guidelines you can find here the full documentation.\n\nWXSS has almost all of the features CSS has. The style sheet defined in app.wxss is the common style rules identified on each page. The style sheet defined in a particular page is a local style that acts only on the current page and thus overwrites same selectors used in app.wxss. WXSS compared to CSS has two major differences:\n\nWXSS uses (responsive pixel) as unit. It allows to adjust pixels according to the width of the screen. You may continue to use the classic unit (just not the WeChat way of doing things).\n\nTo import outbound style sheet use statement followed by the relative path and a at the end of the statement.\n\nWeChat framework cannot support lot of standard CSS selectors, such as cascading selector.\n• In development use Iphone 6 device as a standard visual. You may have some glitches on smaller screens.\n\nWeChat framework provides to developers a large set of basic components, the exhaustive list of components is here.\n\nis your anchor in html. It is used to link from one page to another. The most important attribute of the navigator element is .\n\nPicker component in WeChat documentation is divided in three selectors, classic selector which is the default one, time selector and date selector.\n\nThe use case below is based on a date picker but the logic remains the same for another picker.\n\nA switch is a visual toggle with two states, on and off.\n\nA toast is a non-modal element used to display brief and auto-expiring components to inform users.\n\nIn the code snippet below we are faking a form submission to show how a toast is working and display.\n\nIn the code snippet above we created a dynamic button with a purpose of submitting a form. The button is animated by a loading spinner when you click on it.\n\nThen we display a toast by using API to inform users.\n\nA modal box allows to overlay a small element over a page. The primary benefit of modal boxes it that they avoid the need to use of conventional window pop-ups or page reloads.\n\nThere are five situational categories where modal boxes are commonly used:\n• Error: To alert users of an error.\n• Confirm or Prompt: To remind users to do something before moving on.\n\nThe component is a native component, it has a long list of attributes, we will go through the major ones. Here is the link to WeChat documenation for more details.\n\nRefer to the Location-based services part of the wiki if you want to have a look on location-based services WeChat is offering through the API.\n• Do not use scroll-view on map component.\n• CSS animation on the map component is invalid.\n• need to specify as\n\nThis section aims to explain the different steps you have to follow if you want to persist your app data and fetch data on a database. We selected Leancloud.cn for the simplicity of its installation for beginners.\n\nSome context first: The example below is based on a Mini-program aimed at gathering feedbacks through a simple form. This mini-program persists the data collected on Leancloud.cn. We will explain how to fetch and display data stored on the DB. To illustrate this second section (fetch data) we created a new page that displays all reviews stored on Leancloud.\n\nHere is the Github repository of the project used to create this tutorial.\n• Create an object and encapsulate data you want to persist.\n• Create a new review page and a button to redirect users to this review page.\n\nWhen the structure of the form is created as above, next we need to create the event which is trigerred by the form submission.\n\nLocal storage: In the function, we assigned user's inputs to local variables in the purpose of testing if we can collect form's user inputs locally.\n\nBefore we begin the installation, if you are in development white list your domain name by checking up the last checkbox of the project interface within your WeChat IDE . For specific debugging needs you can follow this Leancloud tutorial.\n\nTo get started with Leancloud setup, first create an account on Leancloud.\n\nNow that you are ready for the installation and initialization of Leancloud in your mini-program you can follow their documentation that will let you go through a two-step process:\n• The installation of the av-weapp-min.js in your utils folder.\n• The initialization of the app by adding Leancloud and in your app.js.\n\nIf you are lost refer to the Github repository of the project.\n\nIn the first place, create a new folder called model and add a file to this folder. Named your file in accordance with the kind of object you want to persist, in this case a form. This step is not required but permits to keep your files organised.\n\nLet's create the object: In the form.js file you just created, require av-weapp-min.js you installed in util.js and assigns it to an constant. Then instantiate the object.\n\nCode snippet \"require Leancloud and create an object\" example.\n\nNow that you have instantiated the object, create the form object to encapsulate data in the logical layer (here form.js) and redirect user after the form submission.\n• Inside the function we added permissions that allow Leancloud to read and write through the object we created and want to persist.\n• We defined a function that encapsulate data in the new object and redirect user when the form is submitted.\n\nSo far everything is done within your mini-program, what remains to be done is a projection of the data collected within your Leancloud dashboard.\n• Create a table in this project by adding the class object you created, such as a class in this exemple.\n• Add columns to your table (be cautionous on the data type you specify when you add your columns).\n\nTest it to be sure that the data collected is persisted within your Leancloud dashboard.\n\nFirst let me remind you the background of this section. We want to display in a new page the list of reviews we have collected and persisted on Leancloud. I assume that you have followed the first section of the tutorial, (if you missed it see above).\n• Fetch data from Leancloud and display all reviews stored.\n\nSo let's create a new review page and a button that redirects to review page. (tip: just add the route path to your app.json, the framework will create the new page folder and files by itself).\n\nThe next step is to fetch data stored on Leancloud and displays it.\n\nCode snippet \"fetch data stored on Leancloud and displays it\" example.\n\nAbove we created a list rendering block using that display each review and name of the person who creates the review.\n• We are doing a query on the object which contains the data stored.\n• Then we are sorting out each form according to its creation date to finish by setting up the array.\n• Display data in the view using the Mustache syntax.\n\nIn this use case we have just seen how to store data we collect locally to Leancloud and how to fetch data stored from Leancloud.\n\nWe recommend you to read the Leancloud documentation or check the LeanTodo mini-program created by Leancloud, Github repository.\n\nWhen you are in production you have to configure Leancloud domain name within WeChat platform. Follow this leancloud tutorial.\n\nAll the user information you have access to through :\n\nWeChat \"quickstart\" (WeChat boilerplate) gives you a function in the app.js file. As the name suggests, this function is meant to obtain user information. Let’s go through this function step by step.\n• function has a parameter cb, which is also a function.\n• The block of function will be passed if from is not null.\n• Otherwise is null, function calls the login interface.\n\nFirst case, form is not null\n\nThe if condition statement aims to determine if cb argument passed to get is a function type and if it is, it will pass .\n\nHow do they figure out if cb parameter is a function?\n\nLet's go through this function of index.js\n• The function calls function on the app instance.\n• They define a function as a parameter that update to current user information.\n• And pass updated to in the app.js file.\n• If is null function returns the statement which calls the login interface.\n• Then the current user successfully log in, is called and act as the block we saw above.\n\nIf current user is already log in, user information are assigned to through index.js page which calls function. And then the same logic is applied.\n\nWechat mini-programs have a mechanism of cache in their API. In fact, each mini-program has its own local cache storage.\n\nReminder: Cache storage is used to store data we want to access quickly. It reduces user waiting time, since the request is satisfied from the local cache which is closer to clients compared to the original server used to request your DB.\n\nCache storage offers two kind of methods to store data in the cache:\n\nbuild parameters as a json, a key to specify the stored key and data to specify the key value to store.\n\nsyntax is simpler, parameters are directly passed. And can get data through the incoming callback function.\n\nWeChat provides three main actions on the cache:\n• Save data in the cache, or .\n• Read data from the cache, or .\n• Clear data of the cache, or .\n• Remove data in the cache, or .\n\nCode snippet \"Fetch data from the cache and display data in a new page (synchronous method)\" exemple .\n\nYou can call up your client code scanner UI by using the API. It gives direct access to the WeChat scanner through a CTA button with the aim of scanning a QR code.\n• to choose the location you want to display.\n• to display location on their buit-in map view.\n\nAbove we used the to retrieve current user position by getting his latitude and longitude.\n\nfurther details: If a user leaves the mini-program but display on top of his chat the mini-program you can continue to call and so get user location continiously.\n\nDisplay the current user location on WeChat built-in map: API call, enables the opening of WeChat built-in map view in order to display the location you got from function we created above.\n• to choose an image from your album or camera.\n• to preview the image before the upload on the app.\n• to save image from the mini-program to your album.\n\nIn the example below we create a function called with the aim of calling user album or camera by using . Then we are using to get image information.\n\nCode snippet \"upload an image from album or camera\" example.\n\nNow that we have an image on the page let's save the image from the mini-program to current user album by long tapping the image.\n\nCode snippet \"long tap the image to save it within user album\" example.\n• to upload a file to the appointed server.\n• to download a file from the appointed server.\n\nIn the example below we have one function and one event handler: and respectively, as their name states, you should be able to add a new post and get posts using a call.\n\nNow that we've posted, let's get and display it to the view layer. For simplicity sake we'll take advantage of onPullDownRefresh to reload new posts.\n\nAll along our mini-programs creation path we encountered issues and questions, we want to share with you. If you had some issues you want to share, reach out us.\n\nWeChat allows only API that have an ICP license, so you can forget about most of the APIs you are familiar with in western countries.\n\nHere is a directory of APIs available in China, check it out.\n\nImage ressources cannot be obtained through the CSS . I know it is dreadful, but we have to deal with it.\n\nThere are two ways to bypass this frustration:\n• You can use the CSS but you can't use a realtive path, you have to encode your image in base64 and then pass it to to the . Here is a tool to encode images in base64.\n• Or you can use the tag and treat images with tag attribute like . WeChat has 13 modes, 9 are cutting mode and 4 are zoom mode. Here is a link to the documenation.\n\nRPX stands for responsive pixel which is the unit of WeChat mini-programs. According to the official definition, is based on the adaptive screen width.\n\nIn fact RPX unit is based on the unit which stands for \"root em\". Why not unit?\n\nThe unit is relative to the font-size of the parent, which causes compounding issue. The unit is relative to the root element which conteracts the compounding issue (font sizing duty).\n\nHowever, to come back to unit, rpx advantages are:\n• It scales according to the width of the ratio (screen width) which makes the experience more responsive.\n• It facilitates the realization of high-definition, 1 pixel line.\n• Well suported on mobile and tablet devices.\n\nAre you working on a mini-program? Do reach out to us if you’d like to share your work, meet our crew, ask for help!\n\nIf you want to contribute, you can send a Pull Request here or give us a shout on shanghai(at)lewagon.com for suggestions!"

        "document": "Entering China’s market means, first and foremost, getting to know WeChat and figuring out how to make a WeChat Mini Program.\n\nLaunched in 2011, WeChat, an instant messaging, social media, and mobile payment app, has 1,26 billion monthly active users as of 2022. And it gets better: when WeChat’s success skyrocketed, in 2017 the creators, Tencent, introduced WeChat Mini Programs — easy-to-create tiny apps within the WeChat application, widely used by business owners in all kinds of industries. Now, there are over 3 million of Mini Programs on the market and counting.\n\nIn this article, we explain how to develop a WeChat Mini Program and share Mind Studio’s own experience of creating a digital product for the Chinese market.\n\nWhat is a WeChat Mini Program and how does it work?\n\nIn a little over a decade, the Chinese messenger WeChat developed by Tencent has turned into an independent ecosystem. Today, it serves as a social media network, an app store with its own payment system, and a massive selection of mobile games.\n\nWeChat Mini Programs are small apps that integrate directly into WeChat and run within the WeChat app. They’re different from traditional apps as they run faster, are easier to develop, and don’t need to be installed. They also offer companies access to WeChat’s enormous user base. But they also have their limitations.\n\nWeChat Mini Programs are fast because they’re small — the limit for a WeChat Mini Program is 10 MB, to make sure they don’t require a lot of processing power. For the same reason, they’re not ripe with features — you can only build so many features in a mere 10 MB.\n\nIt’s possible to only have a Mini Program without developing a native mobile app. However, many companies use their Mini Programs to put the most crucial features at their customers’ fingertips, but still offer a full-sized app for those who want it. A Mini Program can also serve as an advertisement for the main native app.\n\nBrands all over the world primarily use native apps to conduct business, and China is no exception. So, is it still worth investing in building a WeChat Mini Program? We’ve picked the most compelling reasons that will convince you it is.\n\nLet’s start with the fact that building a WeChat Mini Program is not that big of an investment. One of its distinguishing features is simplicity and limited features, which means the design and development stage takes around 35% of the time required to create a unique and complex native app for multiple platforms. Moreover, when businesses use traditional e-commerce platforms, they usually have to pay a fee of up to 20% of the sale, while WeChat Mini Programs are fee-free. In addition, you can save money on notifications feature, as it is provided by WeChat.\n\nWith 78% of the people aged 16-64 using WeChat across the country as of 2020, this platform has truly become an integral part of the Chinese lifestyle. Scanning QR codes, using Mini Programs to pay for transportation, shop while waiting in lines, read the news — these apps are deeply embedded in everyday life of the whole population.\n\nAs of 2022, 70% of population in China has access to the internet, and it’s getting cheaper with each year. Most public places, like coffee shops and malls, have Wi-Fi connection. However, as a rule it is pretty slow, so it makes sense to develop apps that don’t require much internet traffic. That’s one of the biggest benefits of WeChat Mini Programs: they are small and don’t need to be installed like native apps, and therefore take no time to load. This also makes Mini Programs especially popular among users with low purchasing power — in particular, those living in Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities.\n\nWeChat Mini Programs give access to data that allows businesses to analyze their users’ customer journeys, including interactions and conversion rates. This data indicates what adjustments need to be made to the program so that it is more appealing to the consumers. Furthermore, WeChat Mini Programs offer dashboards customized according to the needs of specific businesses.\n\nSince businesses get access to insights regarding their customers’ interactions with Mini Programs, they have all the resources to make further experience with the apps as convenient and efficient as possible. Despite the fact the WeChat Mini Programs have limited features, brands still can and do use live streams, 3D models, AR filters, and other trendy features to attract potential customers. In addition, since users don’t need to download WeChat Mini Programs to their phones, they are extremely convenient and safe in terms of cybersecurity.\n\nWhat kinds of Mini Programs exist on WeChat?\n\nThe short answer to this question is all kinds. If it can be coded in JavaScript, fits within the 10 MB size limit, and complies with the WeChat Terms of Service and Chinese legislation, it can be made into a WeChat Mini Program. But there are few categories that are especially common.\n\nAccording to the research published on Statista in 2021, mini-games are the number one category in terms of time users spend on WeChat Mini Programs. These games can be characterized as hyper-casual, since they offer short sessions, have easy-to-grasp game mechanics, and yet are quite diverse. If you’re interested in developing your own WeChat Mini Program in the gaming field, take a look at our guide on how to create a hyper-casual game.\n\nWhile WeChat Mini Games can be completely independent digital products (like Pinball King or The Strongest Bomb), they are also often used by brands as a tool to increase sales. For instance, in 2022 Coca-Cola in China launched a series of multiplayer mini-games to celebrate the Year of the Tiger. Customers could access the program through a QR code on the back of Coca-Cola cans. Throughout this dynamic experience, users collected “tiger coins” and could complete this digital journey together with their loved ones.\n\nAnother brilliant example of WeChat Mini Games is the collaboration of Tencent Gaming with the Palace Museum in Beijing. Together, they created a game called “Pocket Builder” that brought together those who were nostalgic for Nokia’s iconic Snake game. Here, users can explore the Ming and Qing dynasty home, look for treasures, learn about traditional Chinese architecture and art, as well as share their experience with the game on WeChat feed.\n\nIn 2020, transactions made through WeChat Mini Programs reached around $250 billion, and users who make transactions through these programs increased by 80% in 2021. Naturally, the number of Mini Programs spiked 41% in the last year.\n\nAmong the biggest incentives that the platform offers to e-commerce businesses are:\n• WeChat's user base, which is one of the biggest in China\n• Opportunity to enhance users’ interaction with the brand’s products and/or services\n\nIt’s easy to rethink the decision to purchase while you wait for a page to load. Since Mini Programs are small, they load fast, and their seamless integration with WeChat Pay (WeChat’s own payment system) allows for fast buying. When seeing a product, especially one on sale, users buy it in the blink of an eye. That is why most e-commerce giants in China, like Taobao and JD, have their own Mini Programs and continue creating new ones in collaboration with global brands.\n\nOne of the trends among e-commerce platforms in China is using Mini Programs specifically for live-streaming. How does it work? For example, fashion e-commerce platform Mogujie allows sellers to make live streams to show the products they are selling. The users who are willing to buy these items can immediately make an order through a “See now, buy now” feature. After the launch, customer retention rose by 236% in just 30 days. It took Mogujie only three weekends to develop and launch this Mini Program.\n\nSince the majority of Internet users in China — 1 billion — are using WeChat, it’s no surprise that it has become a major player in the news industry. A Mini Program has become a communication channel for users to interact with news outlets and a quick link to official WeChat accounts, where updates can be added instantly and effortlessly. Whether you’re an official news outlet or a YouTube influencer, a Mini Program can be a convenient way to acquire new followers. The biggest informational sources in China quickly adapted to the new trend and created their own mini apps.\n\nThe biggest news sources in China, including radio and TV stations, and newspapers, have official WeChat accounts and publish their content through their Mini Programs. At the end of 2021, China Central Television's business channel (CCTV-2) even had the most influential official account on WeChat. Other examples of popular media on the platform are Sixth Tone and China Daily, both publishing information in English language.\n\nSince WeChat has become an integral part of Chinese lifestyle, it’s no wonder there are numerous Mini Programs that help locals navigate around their cities. Subway, buses, taxis — you name the type of transportation, and WeChat will offer a Mini Program that will help you find the right way to reach your destination and pay for the ride online.\n\nMoreover, when it comes to travel to other cities, WeChat has got you covered with its mini programs for booking plane and train tickets, and even finding a place to stay.\n\nTravel agency Qunar, for instance, uses live-streaming while showing the users various destinations and offering special deals.\n\nDuring the first few years after WeChat introduced its Mini Programs, businesses used it as a tool for O2O (online to offline) approach. Stores, restaurants, and other service providers encouraged customers to use their Mini Programs in exchange for some kind of bonus points. For instance, McDonald’s China offered discounts to their guests if they showed a cashier a Mini Program on their smartphone. However, now this model is being replaced by a new approach.\n\nAccording to Think with Google, over 60% of shopping journeys start online. However, around 46% of consumers still prefer shopping offline. That is why now, businesses are moving from O2O model to OMO — online merged with offline approach to satisfy every customer’s needs. This means that shopping online and offline are no longer viewed as unconnected encounters, but as one full experience.\n\nIn practice, this means that customers have the opportunity to interact with the product offline and then purchase it online. This way they can, for instance, check the fabric quality of the blouse they are about to buy; taste different varieties of apples and choose the ones they want to purchase; flip through a couple of smartphones to see which one fits their hand — and then get it all delivered to their homes. Instead of waiting in lines at the counter and then carrying all the purchases, customers can now even buy the items they want online while still being in the physical store.\n\nSuch approach also helps businesses to make their customers’ experience highly personalized by enhancing users’ profiles and enriching offline experience by multiple virtual features via Mini Programs.\n\nMini Program by L’Oréal concept store in Shanghai allows customers to receive product recommendations based on their skin analysis and provides personalized content based on their interactions in the store. One more cool feature of the app is a virtual bike tour around Paris, during which users can collect discount points.\n\nHow to make your own WeChat Mini Program\n\nWe’ve singled out five fundamental steps that will get you from raw idea stage to the ready and functioning WeChat Mini Program. Let’s take a look at them.\n\nWhat is the purpose of your WeChat Mini Program? How will it serve your business, and why will it be appealing to your customers? The answers to these questions are vital before you move on to the next stages.\n\nRemember that a Mini Program should not be a replica of your native app if you have one. To decide on the program’s functionality, we recommend conducting research on what features in your native app or website are used the most by the customers. You can do this on your own or delegate this task to your development team. Focus on a single feature (or maximum two) for your project. If there are more, consider building several WeChat Mini Programs for different features.\n\nWeChat Mini Programs can be operated by businesses, not individual users, and the code is written directly within WeChat. Therefore, you need to register an official WeChat developer account. This can be done only if you are either a Chinese company or a WFOE — wholly foreign-owned enterprise with a permit to conduct business in mainland China.\n\nTo register an official WeChat developer account, you need to:\n• Go to WeChat registration page, indicate that you want to create a Mini Program and fill in the form with your personal information\n• Choose the application type you wish to create\n• Fill in the information about your business, provide official documentation and bank details\n• Link your bank account to Tencent and pay the necessary fee to verify your application\n• Wait for the further instructions. This usually takes up to 3 days, after which you might need to provide additional information for your account to be approved.\n\nDeveloping your own WeChat Mini Program isn’t that difficult compared to creating native apps. However, you still need a team that can conduct an all-encompassing research, knows the specifics of this particular market, and has skilled JavaScript developers.\n\nWhen choosing the development team, there are two main factors to take into account:\n• Team’s hourly rate\n\n This directly depends on the specialists’ experience and geographical location. For instance, the average rate of US-based Mini Program developers on WeChat is $72/hour for a middle-skilled JavaScript developer (NY). In the meantime, Eastern European teams like Mind Studios charge around $45/hour while delivering results of the same quality. Therefore, before making a short list of companies you might outsource the development process to, decide on your budget limits and choose accordingly.\n• Relevant experience\n\n While it should be easy enough to find the developers with JavaScript knowledge, it’s also advisable to cooperate with a team who has at least basic understanding of the Chinese market and WeChat specifics.\n\n Apart from the fact that Mind Studios’ front-end developers are well acquainted with WXML and WXSS, we also have experience in building an app for the Chinese market and working with WeChat in particular. Keep reading, and you’ll find out more about our expertise in this area.\n\nStep 4. Delegate design and development to the chosen team\n\nUltimately, building a WeChat Mini Program consists of 3 main stages: the discovery, the UI/UX design, and the development itself. The latter one is fairly easy, as most features in Mini Programs are default. It’s possible to customize the look of your WeChat Mini Program, but this customization is limited. The API integration is also restricted — an HTTP query is allowed only for WeChat-approved sites. The reason for all these limitations is to achieve perfect integration and speedy functionality within the WeChat ecosystem.\n\nTencent offers software for WeChat Mini Program developers where they can write their code (or paste it if they write it elsewhere), make sure the app looks the way it should, and submit it for review. Once your Mini Program is approved — it’s online, and users can search for it on WeChat.\n\nAfter your Mini Program is ready, submit it to WeChat for review and approval. This usually takes 1-3 days, if your Mini Program doesn’t violate any laws and content restrictions in China, and has adequate functionality and design.\n\nHow to advertise your WeChat Mini Program\n\nSince Mini Programs are apps within the WeChat app, the latter one provides all the necessary instruments to successfully advertise your product to the target audience based on their age, gender, interests, and other data. Here, we’ve listed five steps that will help you promote your Mini Program.\n• Pin your WeChat Mini Program to your official WeChat account\n\n This will make it easy for your community to access the Mini Program and allow you to interact with your subscribers, for instance, send notifications and messages to them, etc.\n• Reach out to Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs)\n\n Collaborations with local influencers is probably one of the most effective ways to promote your brand or service. Make a list of KOLs whose content is relevant to your particular industry, like beauty products, technology, etc., and agree upon the terms of them advertising your product. For instance, they can share a QR code for your Mini Program on their Moments for everyone to see and follow. The power of such advertising is remarkable: for instance, over 30 percent of WeChat users buy beauty products and clothes after they’ve been recommended by KOLs.\n• Exploit WeChat groups\n\n Whether you decide to enter already popular WeChat groups or create one of your own, this will help you track your target audience’s interests, pain points, and viral trends. Simply put, it helps to keep the finger on the pulse of what’s going on in the community. This is also the perfect place to announce sales, reward the most active users with discounts or prizes, or even allure customers by making the option of joining your WeChat groups exclusive.\n• Use banner advertisements\n\n Such ads can be featured on WeChat articles in the form of an image or a video with a link to the store, an official account or an HTML5 page. These ads are shown to your target audience defined by WeChat algorithm.\n• Purchase WeChat Moment Ads\n\n Moments on WeChat is the analogue of the newsfeed on other social media platforms. Typically, the Moment ad is blended with the other posts and includes the brand’s name and profile image, pictures or videos, a link to the HTML5 page, and a short text (up to 40 characters). If a WeChat user shares your Moment ad with another user, the platform will feature this ad on the feed of users with the same interests. Moment ads are more expensive than the banner kind, but they are also more engaging.\n\nOne more important point to keep in mind. Since Google, Facebook, Instagram, and other platforms popular in other countries are banned in China, locals use alternative services. So, make sure they can find your brand on Baidu search engine or Weibo, which is the analogue of Twitter in China. These are platforms where users can check whether your brand is legitimate and trustworthy.\n\nExamples of the best WeChat Mini Programs\n\nWith over 3 million WeChat Mini Programs on the market, the biggest world-famous brands also don’t want to miss out on the opportunity to conquer China’s market. Here, we’ve collected the most successful cases of globally known companies entering the market of WeChat Mini Programs.\n\nThis app by Merlin Entertainments (Legoland’s parent company) is a classic example of online merged with offline marketing. Basically, this Mini Program is an interactive map that helps visitors navigate through the park. The map has three main destination categories which are attractions, dining, shopping, and customer service. One more feature are ‘geolocated’ photos the visitors can take through the app.\n\nSay it with Starbucks\n\nLike many other companies who want to increase sales in China, Starbucks launched a Mini Program that allows customers to make direct pick-up or delivery orders. Seems simple, but there is a twist. The key feature here is the social gifting option, which became viral thanks to “Say it with Starbucks” marketing campaign. Users could now send gift cards with customized messages to their loved ones directly through this app.\n\nAnd it worked because let’s face it, it’s the little gestures that sometimes make a difference. Wouldn’t it be nice to cheer up your friend before an important job interview with a cup of their favorite coconut latte? Or to finally ask that acquaintance of yours on a date by buying them a blueberry muffin and sending a cute note?\n\nTesla promotes its electric vehicles everywhere, and China is no exception. To conquer this market, they have launched a Mini Program that allows users to book a test drive, and find the nearest charging station. Moreover, they developed a QR code feature through which their customers can schedule appointments at Tesla service centers, and therefore, quickly have maintenance checks or resolve any issues with their vehicles.\n\nOn the eve of Chinese New Year in 2021, Burberry fashion house launched an outstanding campaign featuring their animated character Bobo the Deer. Through both offline activities and using this avatar Mini Program, users could earn points to dress their characters up and even upgrade them to other animals, like a sheep or an ox. Each of such transformations gave customers a chance to win digital and physical gifts from Burberry.\n\nThe offline interactions included scanning QR codes at the brand’s stores and talking to sales people there. Meanwhile, earning points on the app involved commenting, uploading pictures, sharing personalized cards with friends, and so on.\n\nWeChat has become somewhat of a trendsetter for other platforms. After starting off as a social platform, it now provides a full-circle e-commerce experience, allowing users to order take out for dinner, find a cab, and conduct banking operations. This is precisely what we see other social media like Facebook and Instagram doing now: integrating e-commerce into their platforms. However, unlike apps that have an abundance of features, WeChat splits them into numerous small single apps with one or a couple of features each.\n\nSure, it might seem there isn’t much to WeChat Mini Programs design since they are so limited in size and features. But in reality, there are several UI/UX design practices you need to consider if you want to make sure your app is successful.\n\nAs simple as it gets\n\nThe thing with Mini Programs is that the customer’s journey should be quick enough for the user to complete it throughout just one session. Therefore, the user interface should be simple, clean, with a single-level horizontal navigation and no unnecessary distractions. For the same reason, we wouldn’t recommend adding a log-in feature unless you absolutely need the users’ information.\n\nThe main elements of your Mini Program, such as menu, key text, and visual content, shouldn’t depend on internet connection. It’s best if your app can be cached on your customer’s phone — this will lower the bounce rates.\n\nOften, WeChat mini-programs have a matching native app. The common mistake here is trying to make a simpler 10 MB copy of the full version. We don’t recommend doing that, and instead suggest picking one or two most important features of your app as a base for the Mini Program. For instance, if you run an online clothing store, you can make a Mini Program for a delivery option only or for a fashion blog to promote your store.\n\nWhile designing a Mini Program, make sure you take into account all devices your target audience might be using. Also, keep in mind that most of your users from China are using Android-based smartphones, so your Mini Program will need to have a back button on the top bar. Otherwise, there is a risk of users accidentally closing the Mini Program with the standard Android back button.\n\nSlow internet connection can result in slow loading of the content on your Mini Program, and if the screen is completely empty even for a few seconds, it might increase the bounce rates. To minimize this risk, it’s advisable to use loading bars, especially with encouraging CTAs, or a skeleton screen that will make the user think the loading is complete.\n\nWhat is the cost to make a WeChat Mini Program?\n\nLow development costs are one of the biggest benefits of Mini Programs, alongside development speed. As a rule, WeChat Mini Program development requires a team of the following specialists:\n\nNow, let’s take a look at the main stages of WeChat app development and the cost for each of them. All the cost estimates are based on Mind Studios’ rate, which is $45/hour.\n\nIf you’ve decided to enter China’s market, chances are you already have a functioning business and maybe even a website or an app. Therefore, the discovery stage for WeChat Mini Programs will probably be much quicker than in cases with native apps. During this stage, we will evaluate your idea, conduct research on WeChat market within your business niche, and together with you decide on the final concept of the mini app we are going to create.\n\nThough WeChat Mini Programs have just one or a couple of features, there are still a bunch of rules to follow, as we’ve mentioned in the section above. During this stage, the team creates a concept for the app’s visual and functional features based on WeChat users’ need, and after finalizing it with the client, builds prototypes — mockups of the app screens.\n\nUnlike creating native apps, WeChat application development is relatively simple and speedy. The team writes code directly in WeChat developer account, and after the app is ready and approved by the client, we submit it for WeChat validation, which usually takes up to 3 days.\n\nYou may have noticed that we’ve skipped the testing stage. The thing is, WeChat Mini Program testing can be done right within the software provided by Tencent, so there’s no need for a traditional QA specialist. Moreover, in some cases you can even skip on the backend as well:\n• if your Mini Program is only an addition to your native app, in which case they’ll have the same server\n• if there’s no need for data storage, in which case your Mini Program doesn’t require a server at all\n\nTo sum up, we’ve highlighted the approximate cost to build a WeChat Mini Program:\n\nNaturally, these are just rough estimates we’ve made based on our experience. However, the cost of a WeChat Mini Program will very much depend on your business and the specific features you need to implement.\n\nTo get the approximate cost for WeChat Mini Program you want to develop, get in touch with us.\n\nOne of the biggest projects we’ve implemented for the Chinese market happened when WeChat had just launched its Mini Programs, back in 2017. This is when the Mind Studios team truly immersed themselves into the Chinese digital world.\n\nThe task was to create Android and iOS native apps, and a WeChat Mini Program that would help users experience nightlife in Chinese cities. It was also aimed at providing the owners of entertainment establishments with the opportunity to personalize their customers’ experience. As a result, in collaboration with our client Artur Engalychev and designers from HeartBeat.ua, we created Unight — a platform that provides users with direct access to dining and clubbing venues in their city.\n\nAs always, we started our work on the project with a comprehensive research of the Chinese market. During the business analysis stage, our team explored the specifics of local nightlife, as well as digital trends like QR-code scanning practice and the main social media channels. We also communicated with the owners of clubs, restaurants, and other establishments to get a more profound understanding of their own and their target audience’s needs.\n\nWorking on the project also included numerous obstacles, since the Chinese market has its own tricky rules and limitations. For instance, such basic things as integrating maps or dealing with local cloud hosting turned out to be quite a challenge that we managed to embrace.\n\nObviously, we had to pay extra attention to WeChat, which also made us face a few obstacles. For instance, the team puzzled over the ways to integrate the authorization feature, especially for iOS platform, but eventually, they managed to implement everything as was planned. We also made QR-codes scanning a part of many operations on the app, and aggregated Alipay and WeChat Pay — the most popular payment systems in China — via the Ping++ aggregator.\n\nIn the end, we created a unique platform which coincided with the specifics of the Chinese market, and was just what nighttime party lovers and local businesses needed.\n\nBeing deeply rooted into the local culture, WeChat and its Mini Programs is the gate you most probably will have to enter if you want to conquer the Chinese market. Access to a huge user base, easy integration with WeChat ecosystem, a fast way to validate your idea before going big — the opportunities that Mini Programs bring to the table definitely make it worth a try.\n\nThe good news is that it’s neither difficult nor costly, especially if you hire a competent and trustworthy development team from a country with moderate hourly rates.\n\nIf you’re looking into possibilities and searching for information about how to develop a WeChat Mini Program, get in touch with us. Mind Studios’ specialists will answer all your questions, offer tips and recommendations, and provide a cost estimate for your idea."

        "document": "As of January 2022, WeChat Mini Programs have exceeded 450 million daily active users. In order to develop a program for this fast-growing market, you should understand some basics.\n\nIn general, Mini Programs are designed for users to duck quickly into and out of them to do specific tasks. So your user interface should be simple and easy to understand instantly for occasional users.\n\nAvoid anything that requires users to leave and return to your Mini Program. They should be able to accomplish all tasks in one quick session.\n\nBe sure that key elements of your Mini Program – such as crucial images, content, menus and interfaces – do not require a user to be online.\n\nDo not try to replicate the functionality of your native app. Instead, keep your Mini Program focused on offering your core features only, and direct users to download your native app for additional features. Depending on your app, you may also consider creating multiple Mini Programs that offer different sets of features.\n\nFor example, a traditional restaurant application and ordering app may offer restaurant search and reviews in one Mini Program, while confining the ordering features to a separate one.\n\nIn fact, if you reserve high-value tasks for your native app, it provides a strong incentive for users to download your native app and increase your DAU and organic reach. In this way, your Mini Program acts as an effective marketing tool for your core offering.\n\nDo not deviate from established Mini Program and WeChat conventions. Consider simplifying your navigation to single level, in which users can move horizontally forward and backward. Your navigation should be obvious. Keep a back button in your app on the top bar, as the standard back button on the Android phone will cause the user to exit the Mini Program entirely, causing frustration for users who accidentally tap it to go back. Study other Mini Programs and try to emulate their style to avoid reinventing the wheel.\n\nTest on as many different screen sizes and orientations as you can to make sure there are no content overflows. Also test on both iOS and Android devices.\n\nRemember that users who don’t often upgrade their WeChat app and/or device operating systems may experience errors with your program. To avoid them getting a blank white screen (otherwise known as a WSOD – White Screen of Death), have a good error handling system in place.\n\nLeverage the sharing abilities of your WeChat Mini Programs by including a well-composed sharing card and easy-to-see sharing options in the upper-right menu (where it normally appears). If you create additional value for users who share, it will incentivize and encourage users to spread your message and program. Take advantage of your ability to customize the Call To Action in these cards for each instance.\n\nAdd a pop-up notification to remind users to save the Mini Program to their favorites, so they can easily access it later. Users may forget to do this otherwise.\n\nAdd login walls only where they are truly needed. Users may exit your Mini Program immediately if the first thing they see is a prompt to log in before they can do anything else. A good rule of thumb is: If you don’t need user information, don’t ask for it.\n\nUse a simple, minimal “skeleton screen” that loads instantly while a user is waiting for your Mini Program to load. Also consider add a loading bar that clearly shows the user how long they will need to wait. Both of these tools help reduce bounce rates for users with a slow connection.\n\nUse the WeChat API to preload users’ information into forms, thus saving them time and increasing the value of the Mini Program.\n\nAppInChina builds WeChat Mini Programs for our clients.

        "document": "WeChat mini-programs have revolutionized the way businesses connect with their audience in China. With over 1.3 billion monthly active users on WeChat, the potential for reaching and engaging with customers through mini-programs is immense. However, the rapid growth of mini-programs has led to fierce competition for user attention, making it crucial to optimize your mini-program for search and discoverability. This article dives into the world of WeChat mini program search optimization, uncovering the key factors influencing visibility and sharing practical strategies to help your mini program rise above the competition. From understanding WeChat's search algorithm to implementing targeted keyword strategies and taking advantage of WeChat's unique features, you'll gain valuable insights to boost your mini program's exposure and attract more users.\n\nWeChat's built-in search function is a primary gateway for users to discover mini-programs. When a user enters a keyword or phrase in the search bar, WeChat displays a list of relevant mini-programs, official accounts, articles, and other content. Mini programs optimized for relevant keywords with high user engagement tend to rank higher in search results.\n\nWeChat offers various advertising options to promote mini-programs, such as banner ads, moment ads, and MP ad placements. These paid promotion channels can help increase visibility, drive targeted traffic, and acquire new users for MPs. To maximize your mini program's discoverability, optimizing for relevant keywords, ensuring a user-friendly experience, encouraging sharing and word-of-mouth, and leveraging WeChat's various promotion and integration features are crucial. Understanding the different touchpoints and implementing a comprehensive discoverability strategy can increase your mini program's visibility and attract a wider audience within the WeChat ecosystem.\n\nNote: If using English characters, the character limits will be doubled (1 Chinese character equals 2 English letters). ● Use concise and descriptive language that conveys your mini program's value proposition ● Ensure the title and description are relevant and accurately represent your mini program's content and functionality ● Test your mini program's title and description on various devices and screen sizes to ensure optimal readability and appearance ● Follow WeChat's design guidelines and recommendations for font sizes and character limits By adhering to these technical specifications, leveraging the insights from the official design guidelines, and following best practices, you can effectively optimize your mini program's title and description for better discoverability and user engagement within the WeChat ecosystem. Remember to conduct thorough keyword research, analyze competitor strategies, and continuously refine your titles and descriptions based on performance metrics and user feedback to ensure ongoing optimization and success.\n\n1. Set a Mini Program Page as an Official Account Menu Item:\n• In the WeChat official account backend, you can create a menu that includes a direct link to your mini program.\n• This lets users quickly access your mini program from the official account menu, increasing its visibility and convenience.\n• When setting up the menu item, choose a descriptive and compelling title that clearly conveys the purpose and value of your mini-program.\n• Additionally, WeChat uses an algorithm to analyze which menu items users frequently use. The most popular menu items are then displayed on the search result page, providing an additional way to expose your mini-program to potential users.\n• When publishing articles on your WeChat official account, you can include mini program share cards within the content.\n• Share cards act as clickable links that direct users to your mini-program, making it easy for readers to discover and access your mini-program while engaging with your official account content.\n• Design visually appealing share cards that showcase your mini program's key features and benefits to entice users to click through.\n\nOptimizing your WeChat mini program for discoverability is essential to standing out in the competitive Chinese market. Implementing the strategies discussed in this article, such as keyword optimization, title and description crafting, official account integration, and paid advertising, can significantly improve your mini program's visibility and attract a larger audience. However, developing and optimizing a WeChat mini program that delivers exceptional user experiences and drives business growth requires expertise and a deep understanding of the Chinese market.

        "document": "Our user studies in China found that embedded-app designers must consider the context of use, the core functionality of the parent platform, and how the programs will be used.\n\nWeChat, the most popular social application in China, had 1 billion monthly active users as of March 2018. WeChat’s integrated services cover all aspects of daily life in China, including social communication, shopping, bill payments, news, and booking services. A product update at the end of 2017 introduced a new major function in the app: WeChat mini programs (including mini games). Mini programs are similar to apps, but they are built within WeChat: they feel like apps within a larger app. Thus, a Chinese company can interact with users of mobile devices on four distinct channels:\n• WeChat official account for that company\n• WeChat mini programs [the main focus of this study]\n\nWe wondered how people perceive the difference between these different channels and whether certain tasks are better suited to one channel than to another. To find out, we conducted a usability-testing study with 10 WeChat users in Beijing.\n\nEven if you won’t be designing a WeChat mini program, the user-experience implications of this type of extensible user interface are interesting. Traditionally, websites and software applications are closed packages that can’t be extended by users or third-party providers. In contrast, the WeChat mini programs are a different experience architecture, related to products such as:\n• Add-ins for broad software packages, such as browser toolbars and spreadsheet toolpacks (e.g., statistical analysis features that can be added into Excel for those few users who perform ANOVAs, without confusing the vast masses)\n• Facebook Messenger App, which supports third-party games, news, and shopping services within the Games and Discover sections of the app.\n• Integration apps offered by SaaS (Software as a Service) companies (For example, Slack users can install integrations that allow them to link to a Google Calendar event or a Trello card directly from within the Slack application.)\n\nFor those not familiar with mini programs, below are a few examples of what they are and how they work.\n• Mini programs are mobile apps built for and within the WeChat platform. There are mini programs for games, food delivery, shopping, ticket sales, home services, image editing, and more.\n• Users don’t need to install (or uninstall) a mini program. In our research, many users mentioned this feature and believed that it would help save storage space on their phone.\n• Discovery happens primarily from online social sharing and offline QR-code scanning. Many mini games encourage users to share the game with other users in order to earn rewards in the game (e.g., extra lives or bonus points). Offline, ads with QR-codes promote mini programs. For example, a shopping mall advertised a mini program for prepaying parking fees.\n• Mini programs can be accessed from the WeChat home screen, but they’re hidden by default. Because WeChat’s primary function is chatting, the home screen is dedicated to recent conversations. To see mini programs, users need to swipe down from the top; this action reveals a list of recently used mini programs. Although swiping was easy and convenient for regular mini-program users, new or infrequent users weren’t likely to discover programs on their own unless they accidentally swiped down or someone shared a program with them.\n\nOur study revealed insights that designers can apply when developing apps within apps, or in other limited-platform scenarios similar to WeChat’s integrated model.\n\n1. Maintain the core functionality and content that users expect.\n\nPeople who have already used your company’s (full-sized) app have mental models and expectations about the content or services you provide. If a mini version of an application makes it hard for users to find the core content that they want, people will use the app they’re familiar with instead.\n\nDuring our testing, a 36-year-old female user complained that the homepage of the JD shopping mini program was not as informative as the JD mobile app: “On the [mobile app’s] homepage, I can browse for discount information [she swipes through the carousel of images at the top]. It also displays whatever I have viewed and bought, and recommends more similar items. All that info will NOT be shown in the mini program.” She felt that the mini program had less content, and therefore she didn’t want to shop on it.\n\nAnother user, a 24-year-old female, had a similar problem with a mini-program version of a food-delivery service called Meituan. “The first thing I do when I open the delivery app is getting some coupons. That app will automatically show some coupons every time you log in, and I don't know if the mini program will do that.” She opened the mini program and was disappointed: “No, there aren’t any [coupons]. This is all expensive. Also, there aren’t as many promotions displayed [in the carousel] as in the company app.”\n\nIf a mini program can’t do everything that the mobile app can, it should support a handoff solution—an easy way for users to move between the mini program and the mobile app or website to view the full content.\n\n2. Always consider the context of use. On mobile, support quick activities and design for interruption.\n\nDuring our study, many people complained that if a WeChat message arrived while they were in a mini program, they couldn’t easily check the message and then resume their task in the program. Instead, they had to quit the program to view messages. Unfortunately, some mini programs didn’t save users’ progress, forcing them to start over again. Since, at its core, WeChat is a social-communication tool, mini programs should be designed to accommodate multitasking. To minimize the chance of interruption, flows should be efficient and have minimum interaction cost. Here are some suggestions for implementing these principles:\n• Save users’ progress so they can return to a task later. A racing mini game called Happy Ball allowed users to save their progress and come back to it later. A 20-year-old male user complimented this feature: “I play it mainly on public transport and in class when I am bored. It’s all fragmented time. This allows me to stop and go back to it without losing my place, which is good.”\n• Send reminders for users to continue where they left off. Knowing that users may be interrupted during checkout, JD will send a WeChat notification in about half a day if a user left the payment page of the JD mini program without completing the task. This type of reminder can help users who forgot that they’d left something in their shopping cart.\n• Minimize user effort by having good defaults based on WeChat-account data. For example, the JD mini program could automatically fill in users’ information (address and telephone number) on the payment page, because JD accounts are connected to users’ WeChat accounts. Thus, even users who open the JD mini program for the first time could enjoy “one-click payment” and not have to input their details.\n\n3. Take advantage of the platform’s core functionality.\n\nMany users mentioned that they learned about most mini programs and mini games from group chats or from friends. Good mini programs take advantage of the WeChat’s core functionality, which is communication. For example, JD’s mini program promoted group purchases on the homepage even more than the mobile app did. (Group purchases work by offering a discount on a product if enough people agree to purchase the item. If an item doesn’t get enough orders, no one gets the product.) The emphasis on group purchases makes sense in the WeChat context, because the platform makes it easy for users to share a link to their WeChat friends and invite them to participate in a group purchase.\n\nEncouraging users to share is good for your business. However, don’t overdo it! During our testing, many users complained that mini programs, especially mini games, forced them to share content with others. Participants explained, “If I need to share a game to get rewards and keep playing, I’d rather not even get the rewards,” and “Compulsory sharing is the worst.” A 20-year-old male user said, “People will share on their own if you have really good content — Don’t force me to do it like a pyramid scheme.”\n\nMany of our research participants said that they prefer mini programs for services that they only use occasionally, to save space on their phone. For example, a user explained, “If I only have to use the function once a month, I'd use the mini program. For example, dry cleaning. I don’t need to download an app for dry cleaning. I could just use the mini program.” Designers should figure out the needs of occasional users and address them in the mini program directly.\n\nA good example is the SF Express mini program for postal shipments. Compared with the more comprehensive mobile app, this mini program addressed occasional usage by centering the design around the most common user task, Schedule pickup.\n\nInfrequent use requires extreme usability and an emphasis on quick learning, because you can’t assume that users will accumulate knowledge about the design with extended use. Traditional usability guidelines also apply to mini programs. Here’s an example from our study:\n• Design simple navigation for learnability. For example, Carrefour’s mini program used icons and texts in the navigation bar, which was friendly for older adults. A 55-year-old male user who didn’t even know how to search for a mini program could easily browse different categories and items in this program, because it was simple and intuitive enough.\n\nA customer can interact with an organization on many different channels: the mobile app, a mobile website, a desktop website, a WeChat mini program, a WeChat official account, and so on. Designers should consider the entire customer journey, offering a seamless user experience across channels.\n• Simplify channel switching. A good example is how JD shopping notified users when the item they wanted was back in stock. Since, unlike WeChat official accounts, mini programs are not able to send notifications, the JD mini program offered a QR-code of the corresponding JD WeChat official account; following this account allowed users to receive messages from JD and find out when their item became available. During our testing, a user followed this process and got a notification for the VR glasses he wanted to order. He commented, “It is very considerate of this company.”\n• Deliver some content before asking users to switch to another channel. Switching between channels has a high perceived cost: users need to believe that the transition is worth the effort in order to make it. During our testing, one mini program required a user to follow the company’s WeChat account to get more information about its products. Because this request was too much too soon (she’d barely opened the mini program and clicked a button), she left the program immediately.\n• Offer easy paths for switching channels. During our study, a 37-year-old female user really liked a mini program, Heika Camera, which could beautify pictures of hercat. She wanted to download the mobile app, but she browsed and couldn’t find any way to access the mobile app from the mini program.\n\nWeChat mini programs are a new interaction channel; such new channels can be expected to arise anywhere, any time. Designers must be nimble and adapt their products to such new ways of interaction.\n\nTo take advantage of these new opportunities, it is important to understand their strengths and limitations. If you find yourself designing an app within an app or designing for limited-functionality channels (e.g., a smartwatch, a voice assistant), keep these points in mind:\n• Add value to the product based on the context and frequency of use.\n• Consider the cost of switching channels and how to make transitions seamless.\n• Deliver content and visuals for that platform’s users."

        "document": "Tencent is on a collision course with Apple and Alphabet in setting the trend for the post-app age with its aggressive push into mini mobile applications. Despite a slow start, WeChat is now home to over one million Mini Programs, nearly doubling up from 580,000 in January. That’s half of the entire App store, which was launched 10 years ago!\n\nMini Programs are transforming the digital landscape in how brands are marketing in China.\n\nBut like everything WeChat, competition is already fierce, with 95% of e-commerce brands already having their own Mini Program.\n\nOffering a killer Mini Program user experience is key to successful engagement and retention rates: That’s why we’re providing you here with a list of 15 actionable tactics to make sure your MP is a win. They’re based on research and our own experience of spending the past year designing and building them at 31Ten.\n\n1. Design your MP interface for simple tasks and instant understanding\n\nMini Programs are meant for “use and forget”. For the majority of them, you don’t get the opportunity for users to learn all the features from repeat usage, especially within an O2O context. Have occasional users in mind when you design your MP. Convenience and efficiency being leading motivating factors, you need to keep your interface as clutter free as possible and focused on the task at hand. The first few seconds of entering a Mini Program are crucial to understand its functionalities and how to interact with it, and each screen should have a clear focus and flow outline.\n\nAs a general rule, try to stay away from anything that requires users to remember to go back to the Mini Program to complete tasks: they most likely won’t.\n\n2. Consider breaking down your Mini Program footprint over functionality or audience-focused MPs\n\nIn practice, 50% of the top WeChat Mini-programs also have a corresponding Native App. However, research shows replicating a native app is not a good idea if it means trimming functions due to the size constraints of the MP. A best practice is to offer a set of the core features of your App in focused Mini Programs instead.\n\nConsider also breaking down your core functions into multiple dedicated Mini Programs: they can be favorited individually, and serve different target audiences and contexts of use (O2O, gifting vs. direct purchases, etc.).\n\n3. Have an App? Consider using a Mini Program as a teaser to onboard users to the App\n\nApps and Mini Programs do not have necessarily to be opposed in China. While MPs are much lower friction than Apps, especially for infrequent use, they can also nicely complement an App. You can consider offering your core App features as a Mini Program and leave high-value tasks in the App. Take for example Chinese courier leader Shunfeng顺丰: their MP mirrors the App regarding functionalities, except for the two value-added tasks: asking for a Fapiao发票 and order international parcels. This ensures they capture their highest value segment, businesses, into the App.\n\nAnother example is popular photo filter App Meitu美图: they use their Mini Program as a shortcut and a teaser by offering the 3 most popular filters, and inviting the user to download the app for more:\n\n“ Our users wanted an easy registration interface. By launching a Mini Program, not only the DAU traffic has increased exponentially, but the organic downloads of the App have gone up as well! ”\n\nAlthough more than 600 million WeChat users have already used Mini Programs before, the average user may not be entirely familiar with their common core features, such as the top bar’s back button for navigation. Whenever offering a navigation depth superior to two levels, consider leveraging the MP bottom menu to enable horizontal navigation between your sections. You may display it only on the deepest navigation levels: users should intuitively feel where they are in the service workflow. And the navigation menu has the added benefit of not diverting attention from using the back button on Android phones, which entirely closes the Mini Program.\n\nAnd always keep in mind the sharing scenario: landing on a Mini Program from opening a shared link does not always show a back button on the top bar. If you do not provide any navigation this can lead to frustrated users.\n\n5. Keep all the screen variations in mind\n\nAlways design a responsive MP with all the possible phone layouts in mind, especially Android devices. Start testing on the smallest phone sizes to make sure there aren’t any content overflows. Many users in China still have iPhone 5’s or small-screen Android devices.\n\n6. Make sure your key elements can be loaded offline\n\nIt should go without saying, but if you are offering a Mini Program geared towards O2O interactions, make sure the core elements are not depending on a network after the first load. The Mini Program is then cached on the user’s phone and will open instantly on next use: having to depend on network quality is then potentially a lost opportunity such as speeding up the process at check-out.\n\nOne of the Mini Programs’ distinct characteristics is their deep embedding within the WeChat ecosystem, with more than 60 different entry points (and counting!). Of these entry points, sharing via chat is #1, accounting for 35% of traffic to MPs. It is crucial to properly leverage the sharing feature: a shared “card” can be unique to a conversation, as both the title and main image can be customized. Below is such an example:\n\n8. Find good incentives to share the Mini Program QR code on Moments\n\nOne of the biggest barriers to going viral for MPs is the fact that we cannot share links on Moments. A standard way of getting around this limitation is to generate a QR code image, save it on the users’ phone with a consent prompt, and ask them to share the image. This is clunky and causes too much friction. You need to come up with an incentive high enough to get your users to go through the hassle of sharing the generated image. Referral deals and social “battle” comparisons work best.\n\nAgain, while super popular, Mini Program users may still not be fully aware of the extent of the default features of an MP, especially when it comes to navigation. Consider pop-up notifications to encourage the user to add it to their favorites (to be later accessed via the top shortcut bar).\n\nMini Programs can only link to an official account via banners shown on O2O entry points (scanning QR codes, payments) at the time of writing, which may be a lost opportunity of converting traffic into followers. If you provide a distinct value through your Official Account — e.g., sending transaction status notifications — you can invite your Mini Program users to follow the OA via a pop-up notification as well.\n\nAn even better experience is to dynamically detect the follow status of your user, and provide them with a CTA. Qunar去哪儿 displays an alert in the user profile section if he/she is not following their account:\n\nAnd again, make sure the benefit for the user to follow your account is as clear as possible. What extra service or functionalities can they access? Typical value proposals are real-time notifications of transactional statuses, high-value tasks such as issuing a Fapiao发票, exclusive deals, etc.\n\n11. Only show a login wall when you really need it\n\nIt’s far too common to see Mini Programs showing users a login prompt that prevents them from doing anything with the MP before they give their consent. Instead, use the wx.login API to register the user in your backend quietly, and only show a login page for features where you absolutely need their user information (e.g., my account/profile section).\n\nBecause of the MP’s size and caching limits, most of them are dynamically loading content from the network. Connection slow? It can take a while for the MP to show content on the screen, no matter how well-designed your user interface may be. Making the user stare at an empty screen or default “downloading” 加载中 prompt can increase bounce rates. Instead, use loading bars to indicate how much time the user should expect to wait or a “skeleton screen” that loads instantly, giving the illusion of loading completion. Pre-load resources in the background to avoid loading times, especially on content browsing and in Mini Program sections with predictable user flow.\n\n13. Take advantage of Mini Program APIs to minimize input complexity\n\nYou can have your Mini Program autofill users’ information in against their consent (address, telephone number, Fapiao information) by tapping into the WeChat API. This can save significant time, and avoid error-prone data entry.\n\nMini Programs are impressive compared to Apps because they work virtually on every phone that has WeChat installed. But in reality, they still have to deal with a wide array of phones and different WeChat versions. There are also users who are unwilling to update their WeChat or OS. You should make sure your users aren’t getting the Mini Program WSOD (white screen of death) and make sure to catch errors. You can select in the Mini Program backend which WeChat and OS versions your Mini Program will run on, and show an upgrade prompt for older versions.\n\nDesigning a highly engaging digital interface is not an exact science, and Mini Programs are no exception. They have an enormous edge over typical Apps by being able to auto-update and create a perfect sandbox for testing out multiple variations with user experience or interface design. Or even for new features to be later integrated into your App.\n\nAny MP project should plan for continuous improvement!\n\nYou should also be leveraging third-party Mini Program analytics to identify bounce rates and CRO issues.\n\nNeed help with your WeChat Mini Program performance? Get in touch!\n\nMini Program not performing as per your KPIs? Struggling with deciding between an H5 or a Mini Program route?
