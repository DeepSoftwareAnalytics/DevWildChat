It provides an efficient way to compute the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a sequence, reducing the computational complexity from O(N^2) to O(N log N), where N is the number of points in the sequence. This article will delve into implementing the FFT algorithm, exploring its principles, variants, and practical considerations.\n\nBefore we dive into the FFT implementation, let’s briefly review the Fourier Transform and its discrete counterpart.\n\nThe Fourier Transform is a mathematical tool that decomposes a function of time (a signal) into its constituent frequencies. It transforms a signal from the time domain to the frequency domain, allowing us to analyze its frequency content.\n\nThe DFT is the discrete equivalent of the Fourier Transform, applicable to sampled signals. For a sequence x[n] of length N, the DFT is defined as:\n• None N is the number of samples\n• None j is the imaginary unit The direct computation of the DFT requires N^2 complex multiplications, which becomes computationally expensive for large N.\n\nThe FFT is an algorithm for computing the DFT more efficiently. The most common FFT algorithm is the Cooley-Tukey algorithm, particularly its radix-2 variant.\n\nThe Cooley-Tukey algorithm is based on the divide-and-conquer approach. It recursively divides the DFT of size N into two interleaved DFTs of size N/2. This process continues until we reach DFTs of size 2, which are trivial to compute.\n\nThe key ideas behind the FFT are:\n• None Exploiting symmetry and periodicity of the complex exponential (twiddle factors).\n• None Recursively breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems.\n\nLet’s look at a basic implementation of the radix-2 Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm in Python:\n\nThis recursive implementation demonstrates the core idea of the FFT algorithm:\n• None The base case is when the input length is 1 or less.\n• None For longer sequences, we split the input into even and odd indices.\n• None We recursively compute the FFT of these subsequences.\n• None We combine the results using the twiddle factors (complex exponentials). While this implementation is clear and demonstrates the principle, it’s not the most efficient in practice. Let’s explore some practical considerations and optimizations.\n\nTo save memory, especially for large inputs, we can implement the FFT in place, modifying the input array directly instead of creating new arrays at each recursive step.\n\nThe divide-and-conquer approach of the FFT algorithm naturally leads to a bit-reversed order of the output. Implementing an efficient bit-reversal permutation can improve the overall performance.\n\nComputing complex exponentials is expensive. We can pre-compute and store the twiddle factors in a lookup table to save computation time.\n\nWhile the recursive implementation is intuitive, an iterative implementation can be more efficient, avoiding the overhead of function calls.\n\nHere’s an optimized, in-place, iterative implementation of the FFT:\n• None It uses bit-reversal permutation at the beginning to reorder the input.\n• None It performs the computation in place, modifying the input array directly.\n• None It uses an iterative approach, avoiding the overhead of recursive function calls.\n• None It computes twiddle factors on the fly, which can be further optimized by using a pre-computed lookup table for larger FFTs.\n\nWhile we’ve focused on the radix-2 algorithm, other variants like radix-4 and split-radix can offer better performance in certain scenarios. The split-radix FFT, in particular, is known for its efficiency in software implementations.\n\nWhen the input signal is real-valued (as is often the case in practical applications), we can exploit this property to almost halve the computation time and storage requirements.\n\nFor very large FFTs or when high performance is crucial, parallel implementations of the FFT can be used. These algorithms distribute the computation across multiple processors or even multiple computers in a network.\n\nIn some applications, we only need a subset of the output frequencies or have some zero-valued inputs. Pruned FFT algorithms can optimize for these cases, skipping unnecessary computations.\n\nThe FFT has a wide range of applications across various fields:\n• None Communications: Modulation and demodulation in systems like OFDM used in Wi-Fi and 4G/5G.\n\nWhen implementing or using FFT algorithms, several factors can affect performance:\n• None Input Size: FFTs work most efficiently when N is a power of 2. If necessary, the input can be zero-padded to the next power of 2.\n• None Memory Access Patterns: Efficient cache usage is crucial for performance, especially for large FFTs.\n• None Numerical Precision: The choice between single and double precision can affect both accuracy and speed.\n• None Specialized Hardware: Many modern processors include specialized instructions for FFT computations. Libraries like FFTW can automatically select the best implementation for the given hardware.\n\nThe Fast Fourier Transform is a cornerstone algorithm in digital signal processing and many other fields. Its efficient implementation has enabled countless applications and continues to be an area of active research and optimization.\n\nWhile we’ve explored the basic principles and optimized implementation of the FFT, it’s worth noting that for most practical applications, using a well-optimized library like FFTW, numpy.fft, or hardware-specific implementations is often the best choice. These libraries incorporate years of optimization work and can automatically choose the best algorithm and implementation for your specific hardware and input size.\n\nUnderstanding the principles behind the FFT, however, is crucial for effectively using these tools and for developing custom implementations when needed. Whether you’re processing audio signals, analyzing scientific data, or developing communications systems, a solid grasp of FFT implementation will serve you well in leveraging this powerful algorithm.\n\nAs we continue to push the boundaries of signal processing and data analysis, the FFT remains an indispensable tool, with ongoing research into even faster algorithms and implementations for emerging computing architectures. The journey of the FFT, from Cooley and Tukey’s breakthrough to today’s highly optimized implementations, is a testament to the enduring importance of efficient algorithms in computing."

        "document": "Recall that in the FFT algorithm, for a given input sequence, we extract the elements at the even indexes and the odd indexes, do FFT on them separately and merge them. This is done recursively.\n\nI will post the original implementation here again:\n\nAlthough the time complexity is O(NlogN) for an input sequence of length N, but as you know that recursion has overhead. Each recursion call, adds a new entry to the function call stack and at the end we also have to roll up the function call stack.\n\nAlso, for each recursion call, we are passing 2 new arrays of size N/2 each. If we draw the recursion tree, we can see that at each level we are allocating O(N) memory and there are O(logN) levels, thus additional memory requirement is O(NlogN).\n\nOne way we can replace recursion is with stacks. This is similar to doing Depth First Traversal on a tree using stacks.\n\nBut in here too, we have to store the intermediate results of each FFT operation and also the maximum size of the stack is O(logN). Total additional memory requirement is still O(NlogN).\n\nInstead of a top down approach, we aim to do a bottom-up approach which in this case is possible because we can reproduce the sequence at the leaf nodes of the recursion tree without going thorugh all paths from the root.\n\nFor a given N=8, the input sequence is [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]\n\nThe final sequence which we evaluate at the last level of the recursion tree is [0,4,2,6,1,5,3,7]\n\nFor e.g. the element at index 1 in input is 1 with binary 001 (3 bits), whereas the element at index 1 in output is 4 with binary 100 which is reverse of 001.\n\nObserve that the bits are reversed for all the elements.\n\nThen we can just run a bottom-up algorithm to calculate the FFT.\n\nHere is the python function for FFT updated to take as input, permutation of the input x according to the final sequence:\n\nNote that the time complexity of the algorithm is still O(NlogN).\n\nBut we have not yet shown the code to calculate the final sequence using bit reversal. I wanted to deliberately keep that part outside of the fft code because the sequence permutation using bit reversal is independent of the input sequence x and is only dependent on N i.e. the size of data.\n\nFor many applications, the size N is almost fixed for many inputs like in time series analysis, the number of time intervals remains constant. But for dynamic N, we can pre-compute a lookup table of final sequences.\n\nNow we come to calculation of the lookup tables using bit reversal.\n\nThere are multiple ways we can do the calculations. In python, we can simply calculate the binary representation of integer using bin() and then reverse it and recalculate new integer using eval().\n\nIn the above ‘m’ is the number of bits for e.g. if n=16, then m=4 because all integers 0 to 15 can be represented using 4 bits: 0000 to 1111\n\nTime complexity of the above algorithm is O(NlogN) because there are N inputs and each input has O(logN) bits. But additional space complexity is O(N). Can we come up with an in-place algorithm?\n\nTo reverse a sequence, one such algorithm is to swap the adjacent elements first, then in pairs of 2, then in 4, then 8 and so on. For e.g. given a sequence x0, x1, … x15, this is how we are gonna reverse it.\n\nBut note that we are dealing with integer sequences and so we have to first convert them to binary representation, do bit reversal in place and then calculate new integer representation all in-place.\n\nInstead we can use bit manipulation to achieve the same without having to convert integer to binary and then binary to integer.\n\nThe idea goes something like this (assuming that the number of bits is power of 2):\n\nIn the 1st step we are doing bitwise AND operation to extract the even and odd bits. Then left shift the odd bits and right shift the even bits by 1 position and then do bitwise OR. This step is similar to swapping the adjacent elements in a sequence.\n\nIn the next step, similarly we do bitwise AND but this time with pairs of 2 bits at a time. Similarly left shift and right shift by 2 bits and do bitwise OR. This step is similar to swapping pairs of 2 elements in the sequence.\n\nThe above approach is not generic for any number of bits and is shown only for 4 bits. Also it is only applicable for number of bits which is a power of 2. i.e. 1, 2, 4, 8 … and so on.\n\nAssuming that we need at-most 32 bit sequence, we can pre-compute the sequences quite easily. For number of bits which are not a power of 2, add 0s to the right of binary representation of x to make number of bits equal to the next higher power of 2.\n\nHere is the full python code to pre-compute the lookup tables:\n\nThe ‘sequences’ is python dict with key equal to the number of bits=m and value equal to the bit reversed sequence for N=2^m.\n\nThus for an input sequence x, we can call the fft_bit_reversal() method as follows:\n\nDoing a benchmark on the unoptimized FFT vs. the optimized FFT, with input sizes ranging from N=2⁸ to 2²⁰, we found that the optimized FFT is at-least 100% faster than the unoptimized FFT i.e. takes half the time to run.\n\nNext we look into another optimization."

Unfortunately, I didn't have any prior exposure to signal processing or working with digital audio in Java so it took me a while to figure all the concepts out.\n\nUltimately, I wanted a way to convert an audio file into a frequency spectrum over time without having to worry reading byte streams, applying window smoothing functions, and making sense of raw FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) output.

        "document": "I recently found this excellent PDF on the Construction of a high performance FFTs by Eric Postpischil. Having developed several FFTs myself I know how hard it is to compete with commercial libraries. Believe me you're doing well if your FFT is only 4x slower than Intel or FFTW, not 40x! You can however compete, and here's how.\n\nTo summarise that article, the author states that Radix2 FFTs are simple but inefficient, the most efficient construct is the radix4 FFT. An even more efficient method is the Radix8 however this often does not fit into the registers on a CPU so Radix4 is preferred.\n\nFFTs can be constructed in stages, so to compute a 1024 point FFT you could perform 10 stages of the Radix2 FFT (as 2^10 - 1024), or 5 stages of the Radix4 FFT (4^5 = 1024). You could even compute a 1024 point FFT in stages of 8*4*4*4*2 if you so choose. Fewer stages means fewer reads and writes to memory (the bottleneck for FFT performance is memory bandwidth) hence dynamically choosing radix 4, 8 or higher is a must. The Radix4 stage is particulary efficient as all weights are 1+0i, 0+1i, -1+0i, 0-1i and Radix4 butterfly code can be written to fit entirely in the cache.\n\nSecondly, each stage in the FFT is not the same. The first stage the weights are all equal to 1+0i. there is no point computing this weight and even multiplying by it as it is a complex multiply by 1, so the first stage may be performed without weights. The final stage may also be treated differently and can be used to perform the Decimation in Time (bit reversal). Eric Postpischil's document covers all this.\n\nThe weights may be precomputed and stored in a table. Sin/cos calculations take around 100-150 cycles each on x86 hardware so precomputing these can save 10-20% of the overall compute time as memory access is in this case faster than CPU calculations. Using fast algorithms to compute sincos in one go is particularly beneficial (Note that cos is equal to sqrt(1.0 - sine*sine), or using table lookups, cos is just a phase shift of sine).\n\nFinally once you have your super streamlined FFT implementation you can utilise SIMD vectorization to compute 4x floating point or 2x double floating point operations per cycle inside the butterfly routine for another 100-300% speed improvement. Taking all of the above you'd have yourself a pretty slick and fast FFT!\n\nTo go further you can perform optimisation on the fly by providing different implementations of the FFT stages targeted to specific processor architectures. Cache size, register count, SSE/SSE2/3/4 instruction sets etc differ per machine so choosing a one size fits all approach is often beaten by targeted routines. In FFTW for instance many smaller size FFTs are highly optimised unrolled (no loops) implementations targeted for a specific architecture. By combining these smaller constructs (such as RadixN routines) you can choose the fastest and best routine for the task at hand."

        "document": "In this tutorial, we will look at the performance of two Java methods: System.arraycopy() and Arrays.copyOf(). First, we’ll analyze their implementations. Second, we’ll run some benchmarks to compare their average execution times.\n\nSystem.arraycopy() copies the array contents from the source array, beginning at the specified position, to the designated position in the destination array. Additionally, before copying, the JVM checks that both source and destination types are the same.\n\nWhen estimating the performance of System.arraycopy(), we need to keep in mind that it is a native method. Native methods are implemented in platform-dependent code (typically C) and accessed through JNI calls.\n\nBecause native methods are already compiled for a specific architecture, we can’t precisely estimate the runtime complexity. Moreover, their complexities can differ between platforms. We can be sure that the worst-case scenario is O(N). However, the processor can copy contiguous blocks of memory one block at a time (memcpy() in C), so actual results can be better.\n\nWe can view only the signature of System.arraycopy():\n\nArrays.copyOf() offers additional functionality on top of what System.arraycopy() implements. While System.arraycopy() simply copies values from the source array to the destination, Arrays.copyOf() also creates new array. If necessary, it will truncate or pad the content.\n\nThe second difference is that the new array can be of a different type than the source array. If that’s the case, the JVM will use reflection, which adds performance overhead.\n\nWhen called with an Object array, copyOf() will invoke the reflective Array.newInstance() method:\n\nHowever, when invoked with primitives as parameters, it doesn’t need reflection to create a destination array:\n\nWe can clearly see that currently, the implementation of Arrays.copyOf() calls System.arraycopy(). As a result, runtime execution should be similar. To confirm our suspicion, we will benchmark the above methods with both primitives and objects as parameters.\n\nLet’s check which copy method is faster with the real test. To do that, we’ll use JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness). We’ll create a simple test in which we will copy values from one array to the other using both System.arraycopy() and Arrays.copyOf().\n\nWe’ll create two test classes. In one test class, we will test primitives, and in the second, we’ll test objects. The benchmark configuration will be the same in both cases.\n\nHere, we specify that we want to run our benchmark only once, with 10 warmup iterations and 100 measurement iterations. Moreover, we would like to calculate the average execution time and collect the results in nanoseconds. To obtain exact results, it is important to perform at least five warmup iterations.\n\nWe need to be sure that we measure only the time spent on method execution and not on array creation. To do that, we’ll initialize the source array in the benchmark setup phase. It’s a good idea to run the benchmark with both big and small numbers.\n\nIn the setup method, we simply initialize an array with random parameters. First, we define the benchmark setup for primitives:\n\nThe same setup follows for the objects benchmark:\n\nWe define two benchmarks that will execute copy operations. First, we’ll call System.arraycopy():\n\nTo make both tests equivalent, we’ve included target array creation in the benchmark.\n\nSecond, we’ll measure the performance of Arrays.copyOf():\n\nAfter running our test, let’s look at the results:\n\nAs we can see, the performance of System.arraycopy() and Arrays.copyOf() differs on the range of measurement error for both primitives and Integer objects. It isn’t surprising, considering the fact that Arrays.copyOf() uses System.arraycopy() under the hood. Since we used two primitive int arrays, no reflective calls were made.\n\nWe need to remember that JMH gives just a rough estimation of execution times, and the results can differ between machines and JVMs.\n\nIt’s worth noting that in HotSpot JVM 16, both Arrays.copyOf() and System.arraycopy() are marked as @IntrinsicCandidate. This annotation means that the annotated method can be replaced with faster low-level code by the HotSpot VM.\n\nThe JIT compiler can (for some or all architectures) substitute intrinsic methods with machine-dependent, greatly optimized instructions. Since native methods are a black box to the compiler, with significant call overhead, the performance of both methods can be better. Again, such performance gains aren’t guaranteed.\n\nIn this example, we’ve looked into the performance of System.arraycopy() and Arrays.copyOf(). First, we analyzed the source code of both methods. Second, we set up an example benchmark to measure their average execution times.\n\nAs a result, we have confirmed our theory that because Arrays.copyOf() uses System.arraycopy(), the performance of both methods is very similar."
