Read the iterative methods section for more information about how these methods work in general. is invoked only for array indexes which have assigned values. It is not invoked for empty slots in sparse arrays. The method is generic. It only expects the value to have a property and integer-keyed properties. Since builds a new array, calling it without using the returned array is an anti-pattern; use or instead.\n\nIt is common to use the callback with one argument (the element being traversed). Certain functions are also commonly used with one argument, even though they take additional optional arguments. These habits may lead to confusing behaviors. Consider: While one might expect , the actual result is . is often used with one argument, but takes two. The first is an expression and the second is the radix to the callback function, passes 3 arguments: the element, the index, and the array. The third argument is ignored by — but not the second one! This is the source of possible confusion. Here is a concise example of the iteration steps: /* first iteration (index is 0): */ parseInt(\"1\", 0); // 1 /* second iteration (index is 1): */ parseInt(\"2\", 1); // NaN /* third iteration (index is 2): */ parseInt(\"3\", 2); // NaN To solve this, define another function that only takes one argument: You can also use the function, which only takes one argument: [\"1\", \"2\", \"3\"].map(Number); // [1, 2, 3] // But unlike parseInt(), Number() will also return a float or (resolved) exponential notation: [\"1.1\", \"2.2e2\", \"3e300\"].map(Number); // [1.1, 220, 3e+300] // For comparison, if we use parseInt() on the array above: [\"1.1\", \"2.2e2\", \"3e300\"].map((str) => parseInt(str, 10)); // [1, 2, 3] See A JavaScript optional argument hazard by Allen Wirfs-Brock for more discussions.\n\nThe callback can have side effects. This is not recommended, because copying methods are best used with pure functions. In this case, we can choose to iterate the array twice. Sometimes this pattern goes to its extreme and the only useful thing that does is causing side effects. const products = [ { name: \"sports car\" }, { name: \"laptop\" }, { name: \"phone\" }, ]; products.map((product) => { product.price = 100; }); As mentioned previously, this is an anti-pattern. If you don't use the return value of , use or a loop instead. Or, if you want to create a new array instead:\n\nUsing the third argument of callbackFn The argument is useful if you want to access another element in the array, especially when you don't have an existing variable that refers to the array. The following example first uses to extract the positive values and then uses to create a new array where each element is the average of its neighbors and itself. const numbers = [3, -1, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]; const averaged = numbers .filter((num) => num > 0) .map((num, idx, arr) => { // Without the arr argument, there's no way to easily access the // intermediate array without saving it to a variable. const prev = arr[idx - 1]; const next = arr[idx + 1]; let count = 1; let total = num; if (prev !== undefined) { count++; total += prev; } if (next !== undefined) { count++; total += next; } const average = total / count; // Keep two decimal places return Math.round(average * 100) / 100; }); console.log(averaged); // [2, 2.67, 2, 3.33, 5, 5.33, 5.67, 4] The argument is not the array that is being built — there is no way to access the array being built from the callback function.\n\nThe method reads the property of and then accesses each property whose key is a nonnegative integer less than . const arrayLike = { length: 3, 0: 2, 1: 3, 2: 4, 3: 5, // ignored by map() since length is 3 }; console.log(Array.prototype.map.call(arrayLike, (x) => x ** 2)); // [ 4, 9, 16 ] This example shows how to iterate through a collection of objects collected by . This is because returns a (which is a collection of objects). In this case, we return all the selected s' values on the screen: You can also use to transform to an array, and then access the method."

        "document": "This credit will be applied to any valid services used during your first days.\n\nThis tutorial shows how to use the JavaScript function, which applies a transformation to the data in an array and constructs a second parallel array. Using the function to transform an array is an alternative to using the keyword or the function. An example of using the JavaScript function looks like:\n• What the JavaScript map() function is\n• What the syntax for the JavaScript map() function is\n• How to use the JavaScript map() function in practice, using examples for numerical transformation, string processing, and HTML generation.\n• How the JavaScript map() function compares to using for loops and the function\n• When and why to use the JavaScript map() function\n\nWhat is the JavaScript map() Function?\n\nThe JavaScript function is a built-in method belonging to the Array object prototype. It is one of JavaScript’s iterators and is designed to work in conjunction with a functional programming model. The function is invoked on an instance of a JavaScript .\n\nTo understand how works, consider this basic example for invoking it on an array named :\n• calls a designated helper function once for every item in the array, processing the items sequentially in their original order.\n• passes the current value, index, and the original array to the function. For some use cases, only the value is required. In these cases, the index and array parameters can be omitted from the helper function’s definition.\n• The helper function transforms or processes the original data to generate a return value.\n• The method uses the return values to build a new array. It returns this array to the code that called . In the example code above, this new array is stored in .\n\nUnlike some JavaScript iterators, the method is non-mutating. It does not alter the original array. The return value from is an entirely new array object. The method is an ECMAScript5 (ES5) feature and is supported by all modern browsers. It can act upon any JavaScript array, even an empty array or one containing undefined items.\n\nThe method can follow one of several formats, depending on the definition of the helper function. In each case, the method works the same way:\n• None Inline function: The associated function is defined inline as an argument to . The function accepts up to three values.\n• None Callback function: The associated function is explicitly defined elsewhere in the code. In the example code below, this is referenced as . accepts the name of the function as its parameter. The function can specify the , and as potential parameters.\n• None Arrow function: The associated function is defined inline as an arrow function. An arrow function uses a simplified notation that is handy for short, concise functions. Although the syntax is pared down, this is similar to the inline function syntax. Arrow functions behave differently from a regular function expressions in a few ways, as described in the MDN web documentation\n\nIn many cases, the argument is not required and is not included as a parameter. Without the third argument, the inline function syntax is structured as follows:\n\nIt is also possible to pass the keyword to the method. In practice, the argument is not typically used. If it is used, is the passed as the second parameter to the method, after the callback function:\n\nHow to Use the JavaScript map() Function\n\nUsing the function is a good approach whenever an algorithm must derive a second array from the initial set of values. Some examples of typical use cases include transforming numerical data, manipulating strings, and generating HTML code. The following examples illustrate some common use cases.\n\nThe example below uses the JavaScript function for numerical processing. It accepts an array containing the salaries of a group of employees. The example code applies a 20% raise to the employees’ salaries:\n\nExecuting this code results in the following output:\n• The array, which contains the employees’ original salaries, does not change when this code is executed. The old set of values is retained and can be used to reference the employees’ historical salaries.\n• is invoked using an inline function. The inline function only uses the value of each item, so it only has one parameter. The optional index and array arguments are omitted.\n• The new array returned by is stored in the array.\n\nThe inline function from the code example can be rewritten using an arrow function. The following is an example of how to convert the original inline function to an arrow function:\n\nThe results should be the same as before:\n\nIf the salary raise transformation is used in several places, define it as a callback function. This improves the clarity of the code and promotes maintainability and quality control:\n\nnow calls the function, rather than an inline function. This code also generates the same results as the other two examples earlier in this section.\n\nAnother common use for the function is to process a series of strings. The strings can be concatenated or reformatted. The example below processes an array representing a queue of customers. For each person, the function generates a new string combining their last and first names along with their position in the queue:\n\nExecuting the JavaScript code above results in the following output:\n\nThe inline function in this example uses the template literal syntax to build the string. Each new string is added to the array.\n\nJavaScript is widely used on web pages, where it is often responsible for building HTML markup. In this example, is used to wrap data in HTML.\n\nWhen this code is run in a web browser developer console, the body of the page is updated with the following markup:\n\nloops and the function are two other ways to manipulate data in an array:\n• A loop can be written that visits each index in an array.\n• Like the function, the function is also invoked on array objects. It accepts a helper function argument that is executed on the elements in the array. However, the function does not return a value, unlike the function.\n\nThe behavior of a JavaScript loop is defined inside the body of the loop. However, it does not automatically generate a new array either. Any new data structures must be deliberately created or modified inside the body of the loop.\n\nIn practice, a distinction between and the is that the helper function passed to generally does not alter the original array. Code that uses the function sometimes modifies the original array, instead of creating a new data structure.\n\nUse to retain the original array and create a new array derived from the values of the first array. or a loop can be used to permanently modify the original array, or to discard the newly-calculated values after use. and are also better choices for operations where the original array is not modified, including logging or printing.\n\nThere are a few additional considerations to keep in mind when using the method:\n• None Concurrent modification of the original array is strongly discouraged. In other words, do not add or delete any array elements inside the helper function. Although the function has rules regarding these situations, the resulting code is typically confusing and hard to debug.\n• None Do not use functions that can take additional optional parameters directly as callback functions. The element could be accidentally passed to the function as a second parameter, leading to errors or confusing results.\n• None Use the method when both arrays must be retained. Do not use if the program has no further use for the new array or if the original data can be discarded.\n• None The helper function must return a new value with each iteration of the loop. If the function does not return anything, do not use it with .\n\nSee the MDN web documentation for further information.\n\nThe JavaScript method is a handy tool for array processing. It applies a transformation to the data in an array to create a new array, leaving the original array untouched. The method accepts an inline, arrow, or callback function as a parameter. It calls this function once for each item in the array, passing in data about the array and receiving a return value in reply.\n\nProgrammers can use the JavaScript procedure for numerical processing, string manipulation, HTML generation, and other purposes. is an alternative to the function and loop. Code that uses and can alter the original data and does not necessarily create a new array.
