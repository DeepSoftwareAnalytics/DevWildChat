Most TeX distributions' default output is , but or documents are relatively easy to produce as well.\n\nThere two general ways to compile a LaTeX document:\n\nA LaTeX editor such as TeXmaker or TeXworks includes the functionality to compile a LaTeX document with the push of a button. The specific editor being used should include information on how this is done, so it is best to refer directly to the website of the chosen editor for information on its operation.\n\nThe commands listed below should work equally well in a Windows, Unix/Linux, or Mac environment.\n\nIn the command line or terminal, first navigate to the location where your file is saved. The following commands can then be used:\n• will compile and output the file\n• will compile and output the file\n\nYou can also use the command line/terminal to convert between different file types.
