Conditions for a valid password are:\n‚Ä¢ Should have at least one number.\n‚Ä¢ Should have at least one uppercase and one lowercase character.\n‚Ä¢ Should have at least one special symbol.\n‚Ä¢ Should be between 6 to 20 characters long.\n\nWe can check if a given string is eligible to be a password or not using multiple ways. Method #1: Naive Method (Without using Regex).\n\nThis code used boolean functions to check if all the conditions were satisfied or not. We see that though the complexity of the code is basic, the length is considerable. Method #2: Using regex compile() method of Regex module makes a Regex object, making it possible to execute regex functions onto the pat variable. Then we check if the pattern defined by pat is followed by the input string passwd. If so, the search method returns true, which would allow the password to be valid.\n\nUsing ascii values and for loop:\n\nThis code uses a function that checks if a given password satisfies certain conditions. It uses a single for loop to iterate through the characters in the password string, and checks if the password contains at least one digit, one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one special symbol from a predefined list and based on ascii values. It sets a boolean variable ‚Äúval‚Äù to True if all these conditions are satisfied, and returns ‚Äúval‚Äù at the end of the function.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the length of the password string. The space complexity is O(1), as the size of the variables used in the function does not depend on the size of the input."

        "document": "Passwords are everywhere in our digital lives, from social media accounts to banking. Building a tool to check password strength will not only teach you the basics of Python but also reinforce concepts like conditional statements, loops, and string manipulations. By the end of this project, you‚Äôll be one step closer to mastering Python fundamentals.\n\nA Password Strength Checker is a simple program that evaluates the strength of a password based on several rules. Typically, strong passwords have a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, and are usually at least eight characters long. Our checker will look for these features and give feedback to the user.\n\nBefore we begin coding, make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install it. You can write your code in any text editor or IDE, such as VS Code or PyCharm.\n\nOnce you have everything ready, create a new file called .\n\nLet‚Äôs start by outlining what makes a strong password. Our program will use the following rules to evaluate a password:\n‚Ä¢ Uppercase Letters: Contains at least one uppercase letter ( ).\n‚Ä¢ Lowercase Letters: Contains at least one lowercase letter ( ).\n‚Ä¢ Numbers: Contains at least one number ( ).\n‚Ä¢ Special Characters: Includes at least one special character ( ).\n\nHere‚Äôs how we can check for these criteria in Python:\n\nimport re # Importing Regular Expressions for pattern matching\n\ndef password_strength(password):\n\n # Checking for the minimum length\n\n if len(password) < 8:\n\n return \"Weak Password: Password must be at least 8 characters long.\"\n\n # Using Regular Expressions to check for each rule\n\n if not re.search(\"[A-Z]\", password):\n\n return \"Weak Password: Add at least one uppercase letter.\"\n\n if not re.search(\"[a-z]\", password):\n\n return \"Weak Password: Add at least one lowercase letter.\"\n\n if not re.search(\"[0-9]\", password):\n\n return \"Weak Password: Add at least one number.\"\n\n if not re.search(\"[@#$%^&*]\", password):\n\n return \"Weak Password: Include at least one special character.\"\n\n return \"Strong Password!\"\n\nNow that we have a function to evaluate passwords, let‚Äôs create a small script that accepts a password from the user and prints the results. Here‚Äôs what our complete program looks like:\n\nimport re\n\n# Function to check password strength\n\ndef password_strength(password):\n\n if len(password) < 8:\n\n return \"Weak Password: Password must be at least 8 characters long.\"\n\n if not re.search(\"[A-Z]\", password):\n\n return \"Weak Password: Add at least one uppercase letter.\"\n\n if not re.search(\"[a-z]\", password):\n\n return \"Weak Password: Add at least one lowercase letter.\"\n\n if not re.search(\"[0-9]\", password):\n\n return \"Weak Password: Add at least one number.\"\n\n if not re.search(\"[@#$%^&*]\", password):\n\n return \"Weak Password: Include at least one special character.\"\n\n return \"Strong Password!\"\n\n# Take user input\n\nuser_password = input(\"Enter a password to check its strength: \")\n\n# Call the function and display the result\n\nprint(password_strength(user_password))\n‚Ä¢ User Input: The program starts by asking the user to enter a password.\n‚Ä¢ Evaluation: The function checks the length and composition of the password using regular expressions ( ).\n‚Ä¢ Feedback: Based on the findings, the function returns whether the password is weak or strong, along with recommendations for improvement.\n\nAs you become more comfortable, you can expand this project by adding features like:\n‚Ä¢ Password Suggestions: If the password is weak, suggest a strong password.\n‚Ä¢ Password History: Save previous passwords and their strengths to a file for reference.\n\nStep 6: Why Is This Project Important?\n‚Ä¢ Practice with Conditionals and Loops: This program relies on basic statements and logical operators, which are core building blocks in any programming language.\n‚Ä¢ String Manipulation: You‚Äôll learn how to work with strings and use regular expressions for pattern matching.\n‚Ä¢ User Interaction: Handling user input and displaying results is a common feature in many applications, making this project a solid foundation.\n\nBuilding a Password Strength Checker is a great starting point for new programmers. Not only does it introduce you to core Python concepts, but it also creates something practical that can be used in real-world scenarios. Once you‚Äôve mastered this, consider adding more features or moving on to more complex projects like a Password Manager.\n\nNow, go ahead and try building your own Password Strength Checker. It‚Äôs time to take your Python skills to the next level!\n\nHappy coding, and may your code always run bug-free! üòä\n\nThank you for reading until the end.

The next time you need to do so, be sure to use the nifty functions and .\n\nIn this tutorial, we'll learn about Python's and functions and use simple examples to understand how they work.\n\nBefore we jump into and , let's quickly revisit the Boolean data type in Python. You can call on any Python object to get its truth value. You can run the code examples below in your favorite IDE.\n\nAs shown in the snippet above,\n‚Ä¢ has a truth value of ,\n‚Ä¢ The number zero( ) ‚Äì integer, floating point, and complex number representations of ‚Äì all have a truth value of , and\n‚Ä¢ All empty iterables like lists, tuples, and strings have a truth value of .\n\nThat said, it's fairly intuitive that all non-zero values, and non-empty iterables have a truth value of .\n\nHow to Use the any() Function in Python\n\nLet's understand the syntax of the function, look at some simple examples, and then proceed to more useful examples.\n‚Ä¢ Returns if is for any in the iterable.\n‚Ä¢ Returns if the iterable is empty.\n\nTherefore, the function takes an iterable as the argument, and returns so long as at least one of the items in the iterable is .\n\nHere are a few simple examples to verify how the function works:\n\nHow to Use Python's any() Function to Check for Digits in a String\n\nLet's now use the function to check if there are any digits in a string. Let's write down the steps.\n‚Ä¢ To check: Are there any digits in the string?\n‚Ä¢ Loop through the string to access each character in the string.\n‚Ä¢ Check if each character is a digit by calling the method on it.\n‚Ä¢ returns if the character under test is a digit, else it returns .\n\nList comprehensions can be very helpful in collecting all these truth values in a list. Here's a quick recap:\n\nAs shown in the code snippet below, our example string contains digits.\n\nTherefore, calling function on the string should return . We use list comprehension to get a list of and values depending on whether the character is a digit or not.\n\nNotice how is a list with as many items as the length of the string.\n\nFor each character in the string, there's a corresponding truth value ‚Äì if the character is a digit, and if the character is not a digit, as shown below.\n\nHow to Use Python's any() Function to Check for Letters in a String\n\nLet's take another similar example. This time, let's check for the occurrence of letters in a string.\n\nThe string under test is which doesn't contain letters ‚Äì calling returns as expected. For each character in the string, call the method to check whether or not it is a letter.\n\nThe is a list of values, as verified below:\n\nHow to Use Python's any() Function to Combine Multiple Conditions with Logical OR\n\nLet's say you decide to be more productive and write down the list shown below. However, you choose not to be hard on yourself and decide that you can have lots of sweets so long as one of the items in the list happens!üòÄ\n\nNotice how we have multiple conditions to consider, but choose to have sweets even if one of them evaluates to .\n\nIsn't this very similar to an statement where you need to check if multiple conditions chained by the logical operator evaluate to ? Yes, it is and the function can come in really handy in doing that.\n\nSuppose you have conditions , , , ..., . Consider the pseudocode below:\n\nYou can now collect all these conditions in an iterable, say, a list or a tuple, and then call on that iterable to check if one or more conditions are , as shown below. Isn't this simple? üòÄ\n\nHow to Use the all() Function in Python\n\nLet's start with the syntax of the function.\n‚Ä¢ Returns if is for all values in the iterable.\n‚Ä¢ Returns if the iterable is empty.\n\nThe function takes an iterable as the argument, returns only if all items in the iterable evaluate to or if the iterable is empty. In all other cases, the function returns .\n\nHow to Use Python's all() Function to Check for Letters in a String\n\nLet's take similar examples to check for certain characteristics of strings.\n\nThe test string contains the special character in addition to letters. So, when we check if all characters in the string are letters by using the function, we should get .\n\nNotice how the list has values at all positions where the is present in our string.\n\nHow to Use Python's all() Function to Check for Digits in a String\n\nLet's now check if all characters in the string are digits by using the function. The test string contains only digits, so, calling should return as the list comprehension gives us a list of values.\n\nHow to Use Python's all() Function to Combine Multiple Conditions with Logical AND\n\nLet's consider the following example. This time, you're in contention for an iPad and the conditions are more stringent. You've got to complete all tasks in the list to get an iPad from your cousin.üòÄ\n\nNow, this is very similar to using an statement to check if multiple conditions chained by the logical operator evaluate to , as shown below:\n\nYou could use the function to make this all the more concise by collecting the conditions in an iterable, and then calling the function on the iterable.\n\nI hope this tutorial helped you understand the and functions in Python.\n\nSee you all soon in another post.
