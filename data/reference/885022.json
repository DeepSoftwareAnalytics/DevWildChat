        "document": "Most computer applications can be configured to behave a certain way, be it via command line flags, environment variables, or configuration files. For you as a software developer, dealing with configuration comes with challenges such as parsing untrusted input, validating it, and accessing it on all layers of your program. Using Python as an example, in this blog post I want to share some best practices to help you handle configuration safely and effectively, and I hope to convince you that these are reasonable principles to follow in your own code.\n\nAll but the most simple programs have a set of parameters to control their behavior. As concrete examples, consider the output format of the tool, the port that listens on, or the email address that uses in your commit messages. Depending on the application size and complexity, there may be many such parameters, and they may affect only a small execution detail or the overall program behavior.\n\nWhen you deal with configuration, there are various aspects to consider: First, how is it passed into your program from the outside, parsed, and validated? Second, how is it handled inside the program, accessed, and passed around between components? Depending on the type of application, you have to consider how it can be inspected by the user and updated while the program is running. From an operational point of view you may have to think about how multiple configurations are managed, tested, and deployed to production.\n\nEach of these topics can become quite complex and deserves in-depth treatment of its own. However, in this blog post I want to focus only on the second aspect. I will present some guiding principles for program-internal configuration handling that proved useful in the past and that I would like to recommend for anyone developing small to medium size applications.\n\nIn the past, I built and maintained applications in various programming languages such as Go, Scala, and Python. In this blog post I want to use Python as an example, because its dynamic nature allows for a lot of things that increase development speed and flexibility (modifying classes at runtime, for example), but may make maintenance and refactoring harder in the long run.\n\nWhen talking about the big ideas how software should work and how components should interact, sometimes it is hard to see the connection to concrete code. To avoid this, let’s jump right in and see a code example with a number of issues that I want to address in this post:\n\nIn the comments I already gave some hints on what may be bad about that code, but let’s explore it in more detail now.\n\nProgramming is an intellectually challenging task, so I believe that we as software engineers should delegate as many complicated tasks as possible to our tools, such as IDEs, linters, formatters, compilers, or type checkers. If there is a way to find bugs and improve code quality using a tool, then I think this justifies writing the code in a way that such a tool can be used.\n\nAlso, if there is a bug in the code in spite of our careful checking and using tools, then it should be reported as soon as possible when the application starts up, should lead to a big warning message and, in many cases, the program exiting right away. Nothing is worse than discovering that some configuration key is missing in the middle of the night, hours after a seemingly successful deployment.\n\nBased on these foundations, I think that a data structure for handling application-internal configuration should follow these four principles:\n• It should use identifiers rather than string keys to access configuration values.\n• Its values should be statically typed.\n• It should be validated early.\n• It should be declared close to where it is used.\n\nLet me explain these principles and their consequences below.\n\nMaybe related to a certain “JSONification” of file exchange and serialization formats in recent years, the string-keyed dictionary that can hold anything as a value – in terms of PEP 484 – seems to have become the one-stop data structure for many Python developers. It’s very straightforward to just a JSON-formatted string into a Python dictionary and then access it everywhere like or , as I did in the introductory example. (This approach is not unique to Python, for example the Lightbend configuration library for Scala also has an API like .) If a new configuration entry is needed, just add it to the JSON file and use it right away all over the code.\n\nHowever, there is a number of drawbacks to this approach:\n• It is not possible to detect inconsistent spelling, for example whether a key was or .\n• If there is an inconsistency, there is no single point where the correct schema is defined. Correct is whatever happens to be in the dictionary.\n• Missing data is not discovered until the data is actually accessed.\n• Renaming a key cannot be done using IDE/tool support, but all occurrences of the string need to be found and replaced.\n• Tools that check consistent formatting of variable names cannot be used.\n\nSo rather than using string keys – in a dictionary or as a parameter to some method – I recommend to use identifiers. The straightforward method is to use class members, and then write rather than . Note that Python’s (introduced in version 3.7, but available in 3.6 via the dataclasses module) are very handy to hold this kind of data.\n\nDoing so solves the problems listed above:\n• In compiled languages the compiler obviously tells you right away if there is a spelling mistake, but also for Python a sufficiently modern IDE usually points out if an undeclared variable or class member is used.\n• The class definition is the one ground truth that defines what the correct name is.\n• Even in Python it can happen that a declared variable has not been initialized (see PEP 526), but in many cases the IDE or linter tells you about it.\n• Renaming is easily done using IDE support.\n• Normal formatters or style checkers can be applied.\n\nIn the previous section we saw how the part of may cause problems, now let’s have a look at the part. I don’t want to enter into the general discussion of statically vs dynamically typed programming languages in all its facets here, but as far as program correctness is concerned there exists some evidence that static type checking reduces the effort and leads to better results when fixing bugs. In Python, such checks can be performed by mypy for code that is using type annotations. I want to encourage you to use these annotations all over your code, not only when working with configuration.\n\nLooking at one example from above, , for a function that expects an integral value this code fails if the environment variable is set, because the entries of are always strings. You may know this by heart or not, but if the function is declared like then a check with shows you that something is wrong:\n\nBesides these basic checks, static typing provides an elegant way to limit the set of possible inputs accepted by your code. For example, when you have a configuration entry referencing a file, use a rather than and avoid having to deal with strings that are not valid file names. If there is a fixed number of possible values, use an to represent it. If only either one or another value may be specified, use a . If a value is optional, make it explicit through the use of . By using the type system to formally specify what a value is allowed to be or not, you can use tools to discover code paths that you didn’t cover – or ones that can actually never happen.\n\nOne additional thing to consider, in particular when dealing with physical dimensions like duration, weight, distance, speed etc., is to abstract away the concrete unit and work with the dimension instead. For example, rather than declaring a configuration entry like, say, or , declare it like . You can then write most of your code in terms of these dimensions, calculate with them on an abstract level, and only convert them into a concrete value when working with external libraries, for example when calling .\n\nA final word of caution: in Python, type annotations have no validating effect at runtime. Even if all your code is annotated and passes type checking, if a variable is a string at runtime then unexpected things will happen. Making sure that the actual data looks as you expected is the topic of the next section.\n\nFor most configuration values, there is a certain shape, type, or range of data that makes sense. Using static typing as described in the previous section is already an example of declaring a shape that a value must have to be usable. There may be other constraints, like minimum and maximum value, matching a certain regular expression, or pointing to another (existing) section of the configuration.\n\nA simple way to perform validation is at the location where the configuration is used. For example, you could write\n\nor similar whenever you use these values.\n\nHowever, this leads to a couple of problems:\n• The value must be validated at every location where it is used, leading to code duplication. Alternatively, you need to remember whether it was already validated or not when you use it.\n• If something is wrong, then the problem shows up only when the configuration value is accessed for the first time. This makes it harder to spot errors and takes more effort to check that a new configuration value is actually valid.\n• As written above, in Python even if it says in the class declaration, could be a string at runtime. That is something that you definitely do not want to check every time you use the value.\n\nTherefore I would advise to validate the configuration as soon as possible after program startup, and exit immediately if it is found to be invalid. Note that if you chose to represent configuration entries using appropriate types as suggested in the previous section, just parsing the configuration successfully already leaves you with a valid configuration in many cases (cf. Parse, don’t validate).\n\nIn terms of operations, validating early ensures that the program does not exit at some time long after starting because of invalid configuration. In terms of development, it makes life easier because you can just assume everywhere that the configuration data structure only contains valid values and can be used safely, like any other object in your program.\n\n4. Declare Configuration Where it is Used\n\nThis last principle states that configuration entries should be declared close to the place where they are used, for example as a class in the same module as the code that uses it.\n\nThis rule can not directly be derived from the foundations described above, in that it does not necessarily contribute to using tools more efficiently, or to preventing or reporting bugs early. However, it has a couple of advantages in terms of software engineering, when compared with declaring all the configuration entries in a single place:\n• The physical closeness helps navigating, for example it is easier to find the places where a certain configuration entry is used. Furthermore, if you are using a data structure that also defines the valid bounds for a configuration value, it makes sense to do that close to the code that is relying on these bounds.\n• It helps to avoid using the same configuration entry in different, unrelated components. Assume you have an entry, for example something like , defined in a central place and accessible from all modules, then it is tempting to reuse that same timeout entry in various unrelated places rather than adding a new entry, naming and documenting it appropriately. If a configuration is defined locally in the module it is easier to see that this is a bad thing to do, for example you would most likely not import in the module to use it as a setting for your database connection pool.\n• When testing a component that takes configuration as a parameter, you only need to mock a configuration object with the locally used entries, rather than the complete configuration for the whole application.\n\nThe sub-configurations from each module can be assembled into a bigger class using composition or inheritance. In general I recommend composition, as inheriting from multiple small configuration classes is likely to cause naming conflicts at some point.\n\nSo let’s have a look at how we can put the principles together into a small code sample. This example is heavily inspired by the approach described in Section 3.5 of the Scala Best Practices collection by Alexandru Nedelcu.\n\nWe have three modules, each locally defining their well-typed configuration classes. (For the sake of brevity I omit the import statements.)\n\nA class in, say, the module, can take an instance of its local class in the constructor and work with it without having to worry about type mismatches or missing values. A unit test in the module does not have to mock the whole app configuration.\n\nNote that dataclasses are particularly well suited for this application because they cannot have declared but uninitialized members, contrary to normal Python classes. If a member is added to the dataclass declaration, then mypy reports all places where an instance is constructed without providing a value for the new member.\n\nThe main application living in a different module can then define an application-wide configuration class like this:\n\nSo far I have not discussed how you can actually create an instance and perform validation of this global configuration class. For simple cases like this the dacite library that converts dictionaries into dataclasses is very useful. Consider the following code:\n\nIf this code is executed without an exception then we have a valid Configuration object like\n\nand I hope I could convince you that this is in every way a better method to pass configuration data around than just a dictionary with the parsed JSON contents."

        "document": "What Are Configuration Files in Python?\n\nConfiguration files in Python are components that store settings and preferences for applications, enabling developers to manage how software operates under different environments without changing the code. They typically contain key-value pairs which represent settings that can be read and modified.\n\nBy keeping configuration settings in separate files, developers can enhance Python code maintainability, avoid hard-coding values, and provide a flexible way to manage different application settings for development, testing, and production environments.\n\nThis is part of a series of articles about environment variables\n\nWhy Are Configuration Files in Python Needed?\n\nConfiguration files are crucial in Python for several reasons:\n• Abstracting configuration details away from the code, which makes the software more adaptable to different environments. For example, database credentials, API keys, and other environment-specific settings can be stored in configuration files to manage the differences between development, staging, and production setups easily.\n• Easier updates and changes to configuration settings without risking the integrity of the core application code.\n• Improving security, because passwords and API tokens can be segregated from the source code, reducing the risk of accidental exposure.\n\nImportant note: Storing credentials, and other sensitive data, in a configuration file is safer than saving them in your source code, but is also not secure. Anyone with access to your environment will be able to view and compromise the information. This is why it’s important to store sensitive data using a secrets management or configuration management system (like our very own Configu), which can encrypt and control access to sensitive information.\n\nINI files are among the oldest formats used for configuration in Python applications. They are text files with a structure composed of sections, each containing key-value pairs. Libraries like ConfigParser in Python make it straightforward to read, write, and modify INI files, making them an accessible option for basic configurations.\n\nHowever, INI files have an important limitation: They lack support for data structures like lists and dictionaries. This can be cumbersome when the application requires a more complex configuration setup.\n\nYAML (Yet Another Markup Language) is another widely-used configuration file format due to its readability and flexibility. YAML supports nested structures such as lists and dictionaries, making it a choice for more complex configurations. The PyYAML library in Python makes it convenient to work with YAML files.\n\nYAML’s primary advantage is its human-readable format, which is easier to edit directly. However, its flexibility can also be a drawback, as it allows for multiple ways to represent the same data, which can lead to inconsistencies.\n\nJSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a ubiquitous format for configuration files, favored for its lightweight and easy-to-parse structure. JSON supports nested structures similar to YAML, making it suitable for intricate configuration setups. The built-in json module in Python simplifies reading and writing JSON files.\n\nOne downside of JSON is that it is less readable compared to YAML, especially for complex configurations. Despite this, its widespread use and compatibility with other data interchange formats make it a popular choice.\n\nConfigParser is a module in Python’s standard library that provides a way to handle configuration files with a structure composed of sections, each containing key-value pairs. It can read, write, and modify INI files, making it a practical choice for managing simple configurations in Python applications.\n\nConfigParser enables developers to easily separate configuration settings from the main codebase, improving maintainability and flexibility. It supports interpolation, where values in the configuration file can reference other values. This can simplify managing related settings. Additionally, ConfigParser allows for the use of default values that can be overridden in specific sections, providing a mechanism for layered configurations.\n\nTo create a configuration file in Python, you can use the module. This module allows you to create and manipulate files, which are text files with a simple structure composed of sections and key-value pairs.\n\nHere’s how to create a config file with two sections: and .\n\nAfter running this code, a file named will be created in your working directory with the following content:\n\nTo read values from the configuration file, you can use the method of the object. This allows you to access specific settings by their section and key names.\n\nHere’s an example of reading the password from the section:\n\nIf you need to update a value in the configuration file, you can modify the desired key and write the changes back to the file.\n\nHere’s how to update the password for the user:\n\nAfter running this code, the file will be updated with the new password:\n\nBy using these methods, you can easily create, read, and update configuration files in Python, enabling you to manage application settings efficiently.\n\nBest Practices for Managing Configuration Files in Python\n\nOrganize settings logically into sections and use descriptive key names to ensure clarity. Avoid inline comments in formats that do not support them, like JSON. Instead, use documentation to explain complex configuration settings.\n\nAdditionally, keeping configuration files small and modular helps. Split large configuration files into smaller, purpose-specific ones to ease management. For instance, have separate files for database settings, API keys, and general application settings. This approach enhances readability and maintainability.\n\nProper versioning and documentation of configuration files are essential for tracking changes and ensuring consistency. Use version control systems like Git to manage configuration files. Commit changes with detailed messages explaining why the changes were made. This practice helps in understanding the history and reasoning behind configuration modifications.\n\nDocumenting configuration settings and their purpose within the codebase or using a dedicated documentation file enhances transparency. Include details about each key, its acceptable values, and the impact of changing it. This ensures that new team members can quickly understand and manage configurations effectively.\n\nTesting and validating configuration files are crucial steps to ensure application stability. Implement automated tests to check the presence of required keys and validate their values. Use testing frameworks like pytest to create unit tests for configuration files, verifying that they meet defined requirements.\n\nAdditionally, use schema validation libraries like voluptuous or cerberus to enforce structure and data type constraints on configuration files. This validation catches errors early and ensures that configuration files are correct, reducing runtime errors caused by misconfigurations.\n\nLearn more in our detailed guide to testing environment\n\nEnvironment-specific configuration files help manage settings across different stages of development, such as development, testing, staging, and production. Use naming conventions or directories to separate configuration files for each environment. For example, have config.dev.ini, config.test.ini, and config.prod.ini for respective environments.\n\nImplement logic in your application to load the appropriate configuration file based on the environment it is running in. This approach ensures that environment-specific settings are correctly applied, reducing the risk of configuration errors when deploying across different environments.\n\nIn light of the limitations of Dotenv libraries, you should consider a more robust alternative to managing environment variables. Configu is a configuration management platform comprised of two main components, the stand-alone Orchestrator, which is open source, and the Cloud, which is a SaaS solution:\n\nAs applications become more dynamic and distributed in microservices architectures, configurations are getting more fragmented. They are saved as raw text that is spread across multiple stores, databases, files, git repositories, and third-party tools (a typical company will have five to ten different stores).\n\nThe Configu Orchestrator, which is open-source software, is a powerful standalone tool designed to address this challenge by providing configuration orchestration along with Configuration-as-Code (CaC) approach.\n\nConfigu Cloud is the most innovative store purpose-built for configurations, including environment variables, secrets, and feature flags. It is built based on the Configu configuration-as-code (CaC) approach and can model configurations and wrap them with unique layers, providing collaboration capabilities, visibility into configuration workflows, and security and compliance standardization.\n\nUnlike legacy tools, which treat configurations as unstructured data or key-value pairs, Configu is leading the way with a Configuration-as-Code approach. By modeling configurations, they are treated as first-class citizens in the developers’ code. This makes our solution more robust and reliable and also enables Configu to provide more capabilities, such as visualization, a testing framework, and security abilities."

Secrets such as database passwords, API keys, tokens, etc., must be managed appropriately to avoid any breach.\n\nThe need for managing secrets is critical for any organization. Secrets can be leaked in many ways, including through version control systems (never hardcode any secrets in your code!), private messages, email and other communication channels. If secrets are leaked, it can lead to a loss of trust, credibility, and even business (you can learn why here). In some cases, leaked secrets can also lead to legal action. That's why it's so important to have a plan for managing secrets.\n\nIn this post, we will discuss 4 different ways to manage secrets in Python efficiently.\n\nBefore getting started, below are a few things to keep in mind to avoid any issues later.\n• Python IDE such as PyCharm or VS Code\n\nIn this section, we will discuss 4 different ways to manage your secrets in Python.\n\nThe file is a file used to store environment variables in Python. Environment variables are variables set outside of the Python code and are used to configure the Python code. The .env file is typically used to store secret keys and passwords.\n\nWe will use the package for accessing the content of the file. To get started, first install the package using the following command.\n\nCreate a file for testing purposes and paste the following secrets:\n\nOf course, this file should not be committed to your git repo! Otherwise, it would be versioned and readable even after you delete it.\n\nAdd this line to your file:\n\nAlready committed the file? No worries, follow the instructions here:\n\nOnce done, create a main.py file and paste the below-mentioned code snippet. In this code, we are using the function to load content from the file.\n\nWe can also use function, which converts the secrets into a dictionary. Secrets can be accessed by using the following code snippet:\n\nWhen working on a large project, you may find that you need multiple files. For example, you may have a file for your local development environment and a file for your cloud development production environment. The following code snippet can be helpful if you have multiple env files.\n\nTo keep the secrets more organized, you can also use a JSON file. Let's create a file and paste the following secrets into it.\n\nNow that we have the JSON file ready, let’s write a function to access secrets from the file:\n\nEnvironment variables are variables that are set by the operating system or a specific user and are used by programs to determine various settings. We can use these variables to store our secrets and then access them in our program. You can use the following syntax to create an environment variable in macOS or a Linux machine.\n\nOn a Windows machine, you use GUI to add environment variables or use the following command to add a variable.\n\nYou can use the os package to access the os environment variable. Below mentioned is the sample code:\n\nSecrets at the command line should be handled with special care too! Have a look at the best practices with this:\n\nMost cloud service providers offer an inbuilt secrets manager that can be used to create and use secrets across cloud infrastructure. Following the secret managers offered by cloud providers:\n\nAWS Secrets Manager is widely used across the industry. Let’s write a function to create and access a secret in AWS using Boto3.\n\nA KMS is a key management system that is used to manage cryptographic keys. It is typically used in organizations in order to centrally manage and secure keys. A KMS can be used to generate, store, and distribute keys. It can also be used to revoke keys and to monitor key usage.\n\nKMS is a convenient way to centrally manage the keys used by your applications and services and helps to ensure that only authorized users have access to them.\n\nHashicorp Vault is one of the best open-source KMS available in the market that offers a number of features and benefits, including the ability to manage secrets and keys across multiple environments, strong security controls, and good scalability.\n\nLet’s write a function to read and write secrets to a specific path in the vault.\n\nManaging secrets is an essential part of application development. When developers hardcode secrets in cleartext into their applications, it creates a potential security breach. An attacker can use those secrets to access sensitive data if those secrets are discovered.\n\nAnother alternative to the proposed methods here is to check secrets into source code and share them with your team encrypted. This can be a very flexible solution if you learn how to leverage a tool such as Mozilla SOPS. To learn more about SOPS and get started using it, read this tutorial:\n\nDid you know that GitGuardian detects more than 16000 secrets hardcoded into GitHub commits daily?

If specifies a subkey that does not exist, the subkey is created in the specified root.

The SetValue method opens a registry key, sets the value, and closes the key each time it is called. If you need to modify a large number of values, the RegistryKey.SetValue method might provide better performance.

To store 64-bit numbers as RegistryValueKind.QWord values, use the SetValue(String, String, Object, RegistryValueKind) method overload. This overload of SetValue stores all string values as RegistryValueKind.String objects, even if they contain expandable references to environment variables. To save string values as expandable strings (RegistryValueKind.ExpandString), use the SetValue(String, String, Object, RegistryValueKind) method overload.

For example, you can store a System.Int64 as a RegistryValueKind.DWord, but only if its value is less than the maximum value of a System.Int32. You cannot store a single string value as a RegistryValueKind.MultiString. If boxed values are passed for RegistryValueKind.DWord or RegistryValueKind.QWord, the conversion is done using the invariant culture."

        "document": "Registry is one of the most important parts of the operating system, primarily because of the fact that it contains volumes of information regarding the operating system configuration, the hardware details, and software configuration details, amongst other things. And from the point of view of a developer, access to the registry in a programmatic fashion is even more important so that applications have access to all the system related details that they require, and also define their own behavior by storing their configuration in the registry.\n\nPrior to .NET, access to registry was made using the Win32 Registry APIs, exported by the ADVAPI DLL. Under .NET, one can go about using the same set of APIs using Platform Invocation Services (PInvoke) since .NET is all about working with and executing managed code, i.e., code run under the supervision of the common language runtime (CLR), while the the Registry APIs exist in the non-managed (non-.NET) world. Coding definitely becomes inconvenient and terse. So, the better approach is to use the namespace present in the .NET class library.\n\nIn this article, I shall introduce you to the namespace's registry oriented classes, and how to use their methods to interact with the registry. In this process, we shall create a console .NET application, programmed using C#, that will assist us in installing and uninstalling application entries in the registry key. For those who don't know, applications pointed to by entries in this location run automatically (something like what AUTOEXEC.BAT did in the days of DOS) when a user logs on.\n\nis one of the namespaces named after the company. In addition to supporting registry access, this namespace also supports working with various system related and power related event handling for the operating system. But of course, we focus our attention on registry access.\n\nTo work with the registry, the namespace provides two class: and . Essentially, the class is sealed in nature and thus, cannot be inherited, with its main purpose being providing access to the root registry keys:\n\nOf course, not all of these keys are present on all Windows operating systems. The class contains a static field for each of these classes, which is of the type . For e.g., in the process of designing the application discussed earlier, we would need to get a reference to the registry key. Hence, we use the following piece of code:\n\nOf course, we do supply a reference to the namespace before any code referencing the use of registry classes.\n\nOnce we get a reference to the required base registry key, we can use any one of the many methods and/or properties of the class to interact with the registry. But before I move further, below is the listing of the code of our application, in reference to which we shall proceed to understand the protocol of interacting with the registry:\n\nLet's dissect and understand the source code. We start off by referencing the required namespaces. This is followed by displaying of the application name, subsequent to which we check the number of command-line arguments passed to our application. These arguments specify if the application would be creating an entry for an application in the registry key, or deleting its entry from there. The first parameter is to create an entry, or to remove an entry. The name of the entry is the second parameter, while the application pointed to by the entry is the third parameter. The third parameter is ignored by the application if it is deleting its entry, since we just need the entry name for the deletion.\n\nOnce all the checks have been made, we proceed to get a reference to the registry key. This reference is actually type, and we use its method to attempt to open the subkey in a block. This method has two overloaded versions: one that opens the subkey in the read-only mode, and the second one which specifies if we wish to open it in write-access mode. I have used the second method, in which the first parameter is the subkey to be opened, and the second parameter is a boolean value, which if set to , opens the subkey in a write-access mode.\n\nOnce that is done, if an error occurs during the opening of the subkey, an exception will be thrown. We aren't interested in the exact nature of the exception, so I have used a generic \"catch-all\" block, which displays the error message and closes the subkey using the method of the class.\n\nIf, however, the subkey is opened successfully, we store the reference to the same, and proceed to determine the nature of our work, i.e., whether to create an entry or delete it. To create an entry in the subkey, we call the method of the class. The first parameter of this method is the name of the entry that will be created, and the second parameter is the value of the entry, which in this case is the path to the application to be auto-executed.\n\nLikewise, to delete an entry, a call is made to the method of the class, which takes just one parameter: the name of the entry to be deleted. If any error occurs during the creation or the deletion of the entry, an exception will be thrown, which the code catches using the generic \"catch-all\" block. Appropriate messages are then displayed.\n\nOnce everything is done, we finally close the registry keys in the reverse order in which they were opened.\n\nThat is all there is to have a basic to-fro interaction with the registry. Of course, I haven't covered all the methods and properties, but their usage is quite intuitive. But the point is the ease with which we could interact with the registry. If you have ever programmed for the registry using the Win32 Registry APIs, you will definitely see the difference between the approach of .NET and that of the Win32 APIs, and will surely agree that the .NET class has made things very simple to work with."

Then add the registry values to your company's key.\n\nWhen reading the registry from a Web application, the current user depends on the authentication and impersonation implemented in the Web application.\n\nIt is more secure to write data to the user folder (CurrentUser) rather than to the local computer (LocalMachine).\n\nWhen you create a registry value, you need to decide what to do if that value already exists. Another process, perhaps a malicious one, may have already created the value and have access to it. When you put data in the registry value, the data is available to the other process. To prevent this, use the GetValue method. It returns if the key does not already exist.\n\nIt is not secure to store secrets, such as passwords, in the registry as plain text, even if the registry key is protected by ACLs (Access Control Lists).\n\nThe following conditions may cause an exception:\n• None The name of the key is (ArgumentNullException).\n• None The user does not have permissions to create registry keys (SecurityException).\n• None The key name exceeds the 255-character limit (ArgumentException).\n\nTo run this process, your assembly requires a privilege level granted by the RegistryPermission class. If you are running in a partial-trust context, the process might throw an exception due to insufficient privileges. Similarly, the user must have the correct ACLs for creating or writing to settings. For example, a local application that has the code access security permission might not have operating system permission.

        "document": "Modern software is often based on inter-process communication (IPC). Programs and processes use this mechanism to run in parallel, communicate, and share data with each other, ensuring high performance, efficient data processing, and reliable security.\n\nIn this article, we discuss common IPC methods for Python software. You’ll learn what to pay attention to when planning your IPC workflow and find practical examples of inter-process communication in Python with various Python libraries and frameworks.\n\nThis article will be useful for project teams that are considering implementing IPC mechanisms in their projects with the use of Python tools.\n\nThe need for inter-process communication\n\nIn monolithic applications, using language-level function or method calls is enough for establishing interactions among application components. But today’s complex solutions, such as microservices-based applications, run on several instances and thus require more advanced data exchange mechanisms.\n\nInter-process communication (IPC) is a mechanism that allows programs or separate processes to securely communicate with each other, exchange data, and synchronize their activities.\n\nCommon benefits of using IPC are:\n• Efficient data sharing — Using IPC, you can enable different processes in your application to access the same data concurrently.\n• Task modularity — You can split a large task into a set of smaller subtasks that can be accomplished by different processes, thus finishing the initial task faster.\n• Optimized code — With IPC, you don’t have to write extra code for managing communication between programs and processes at a low level.\n\nTo manage inter-process communication, you can use various methods including:\n• Direct communication — Processes exchange data either by using shared data structures in memory or by passing shared data as parameters to function calls.\n• Message queue — Processes use a shared list of messages to communicate with each other without establishing a direct connection.\n• Message passing — Processes exchange data and synchronize their activities via received and sent messages.\n• Shared memory — Processes use a designated memory region that they can access at the same time.\n• Pipes — Processes read data from and write data to a common channel that works as a shared data buffer.\n• Sockets — Processes establish two-way communication and exchange data using an endpoint for communication.\n\nIn this article, we discuss several common ways of managing inter-process communication and offer practical examples of each.\n\nNote that our practical examples show how to do inter-process communication in Python.\n\nPython is famous for being easy to use and offering a large variety of third-party libraries, modules, and frameworks for all kinds of tasks. However, the specifics of inter-process communication within your project might present additional limitations that you need to take into account when choosing your set of tools.\n\nDepending on the specifics of your solution, communication among processes can be categorized based on different dimensions:\n\nEach of these categories has unique limitations that will influence your choice of third-party tools. Let’s take a closer look at these approaches for inter-process communication in Python.\n\nIf your code is supposed to run on a single machine, managing IPC is rather simple.\n\nHowever, if your application requires connecting processes executed on different machines, you need to take an advanced approach. As communication among multiple machines is fundamentally unstable, you need to use special libraries like wrappers over the TCP/IP stack.\n\nAnother thing to take into account when configuring network communication is data security. If you plan to transfer data across the network, make sure to implement proper encryption mechanisms to keep that data well protected. In particular, consider using TLS/SSL encryption for socket connections or SHA-256 hashing, AES, or RSA data encryption for other cases.\n\nProcess interactions can be synchronous or asynchronous. This distinction is especially important for web applications and microservices-based applications, and it defines the behavior of the data-sending side (the client) after starting a communication with the server:\n• For synchronous processes, the client sends a request and then waits for the server’s response before continuing code execution.\n• For asynchronous processes, the client can continue code execution without waiting for the server’s response.\n\nA request from one client can be processed by either one or multiple services. Thus, for some applications, using a single IPC mechanism might be sufficient, while others will need a combination of IPC mechanisms.\n\nSome types of communication can only be used within a specific operating system or architecture. Common examples of such communication mechanisms are:\n\nWhile each of these communication mechanisms can be used in an application written in Python, the functionality they are used in will be difficult to port to other platforms, thus making your solution platform-specific.\n\nTherefore, if you are planning to build a cross-platform solution, avoid using platform-specific communication mechanisms. Also, be attentive when choosing a Python library, as there are libraries that use platform-specific IPC mechanisms under the hood.\n\nChoosing the communication mechanism most suitable for a specific task is crucial. But it’s also important to pick the right approach for serializing and deserializing your data so that it can be transferred securely and efficiently..\n\nIn the next section, we overview several Python modules and frameworks you can use for serialization and deserialization of IPC data.\n\nData serialization is key to ensuring the secure storage and transfer of data during inter-process communication. Python offers a wide selection of dedicated modules and frameworks for changing data structures into a suitable format.\n\nLet’s look at four common Python IPC tools you can use to serialize, deserialize, and validate transferred data:\n\nUsing the standard JSON module, you can encode and decode strings in JSON format to ordinary Python objects.\n\nTo see how you can work with this module, let’s first look at an example of a JsonWrapper class:\n\nUsing this wrapper class, you can create a JSON binary string from a Python object, and vice versa.\n\nHere’s what the code for encoding data to a JSON binary string looks like:\n\nAnd here’s an example for decoding a JSON binary string:\n\nThis module is easy to use, and it provides means for working with Python objects. However, if you plan on working with the JSON module, keep in mind that it requires additional exception handling for the data encoder and decoder. This module is also not suitable for unstable connections, as JSON decoding is very dependent on the format’s strict structure.\n\nProtocol Buffers, or simply Protobuf, is a versatile framework from Google that you can use for constructing a domain-specific messaging system.\n\nWhen working with Protobuf, the usual workflow consists of three steps:\n• Run the compiler command that will create language-specific headers\n• Include the generated files in the project\n\nLet’s look at each of these steps in practice.\n\nInside the project code tree, there should be a .proto file that describes a data structure. As an example, we’ll create an employee.proto file:\n\nFor each data structure you want to serialize, you need to add a new message, specifying the name and type for each field in that message. For more information on creating nested data structures and arrays, see Protofub’s official documentation.\n\nAt this step, you need to run the protobuf compiler and specify the source directory with your application’s source code, the destination directory where the generated code will be placed, and the path to the .proto file:\n\nThe –python_out command-line argument indicates that the output must be a Python module. The compiler may create output files for a number of other languages.\n\nThe next command creates an employee_pb2.py file with multiple internal wrappers, encoders, decoders, and so on:\n\nNow you can work with the created employee class:\n\nIt’s noteworthy that when you serialize data using the Protobuf framework, you create a compact binary representation of an object:\n\nHere’s an example of code that launches data serialization:\n\nWith Protobuf, you need to write less code than when using other tools, because data is defined in the .proto file. Auto-generated serialization also simplifies the handling of data structures. Since messages reside in the same file, there’s no need to ensure the work of both client and server code with the same entities. You can also use the same .proto file to generate headers for multiple languages, ensuring seamless Python inter-process communication with code written in C/C++ and other languages.\n\nAt the same time, the need to work with the compiler adds extra steps to the standard serialization process. As an alternative to using the compiler, you can store module outputs directly in the source code tree, thus cluttering your code.\n\nThe Pydantic library is a useful tool for data validation that provides type hints at runtime. Using Pydantic models, you can ensure smooth and efficient serialization and deserialization of complex data structures.\n\nHere’s an example of a Pydantic script for data validation during serialization or deserialization:\n\nIf validation fails, the script will end with an error, providing you with details on exactly what went wrong.\n\nThe Pydantic library can be used for both loading system settings and validating request data. It allows for validating complex data structures yet has better performance than many similar libraries. However, this approach might be redundant for small data structures with simple types and frequent communications, such as heartbeats or non-critical time synchronization via UDP.\n\nIn order to communicate with native code like a C/C++ program or a native application binary interface (ABI) library at a low level, high-level Python code requires wrappers that account for type sizes, endianness, and pack alignments.\n\nUsing the standard struct module, you can work with raw binary data, packing and unpacking binary streams into usable data structures.\n\nThe pack and unpack methods receive a special format string that represents a low-level data structure: endianness, bit width, etc.\n\nHere’s what a C-style Employee.h structure created with this module looks like:\n\nThe client and server code would require the following wrappers to pack a Python dictionary to or from binary sequences:\n\nYou can learn more about using format strings when packing and unpacking data in the struct module documentation.\n\nThe struct module offers a convenient solution for connecting to low-level ABIs, C/C++ libraries, and legacy code. However, the data encoding and decoding process is hidden and requires precision from a developer. And since the struct module works at a low level, you might need extensive unit test coverage for packing and unpacking operations to discover possible errors.\n\nSince handling of data definitions as strings is not very clear and straightforward, there are other Python modules you can use for working with native code:\n\nNow that you know what tools you can use to manipulate data structures in the desired way, let’s look at some practical examples of IPC methods.\n\nAs we discussed earlier, sockets are one of the advanced methods of inter-process communication. This method is often used in complex software, such as web applications and microservices solutions. In this section, we go over both platform-specific and cross-platform IPC methods based on the use of sockets, providing both client-side and server-side code examples.\n\nNote: This IPC method is platform-specific and is only suitable for Unix-like operating systems.\n\nIn Unix-like platforms, socket files have the .sock extension and are used as communication endpoints for processes, programs, or servers. For communication within the same machine, you can also use Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) socket files. However, to enable communication across machines, BSD socket files require an additional setup such as file node mapping.\n\nLet’s take a look at an example of client-side code for a BSD socket file:\n\nAnd here’s what the server-side code for this socket looks like:\n\nYou can also take a look at what the example above looks in the console:\n\nThis IPC method is rather simple, as the only parameter you need to work with is a unique string. You can use a universally unique identifier so that you don’t have to worry about port number collision.\n\nHowever, BSD socket files only support a single channel of client–server connection and only in a synchronous way, which may harm your application’s performance.\n\nNote: This IPC method is platform-specific and is only suitable for Windows.\n\nNamed pipes are used by calling plain file operations to a file with a name that suits the \\\\.\\pipe\\<PIPE_NAME> format. \n\nSince Windows wraps most of the low-level work inside file operations, in the Python client, you’ll need to use the open function as well as the file.write and file.read methods:\n\nHere’s the code for the server-side of the named pipe-based IPC:\n\nAfter running the code above, you will get the following output:\n\nWorking with named pipes is just as simple as working with file operations. As with BSD socket files, you only need to work with one parameter, which is a unique string.\n\nHowever, this IPC method also shares the same drawback as BSD socket files — you can only work with synchronous client–server connections established via a single channel.\n\nPython’s standard socket module provides a way to use classic BSD-style socket objects in Python code. While most of the module’s capabilities are available across Unix, Windows, and macOS, some behavior may be platform-dependent, so make sure to check the documentation for details.\n\nUsing Python’s socket module is the simplest method to configure cross-platform IPC. You can also easily scale it to inter-machine network communication.\n\nTo ensure the protection of transferred data, you can use Python’s standard SSL module that contains wrappers for TCP/IP sockets with SSL/TLS encryption.\n\nLet’s take a look at an example of the client-side code for IPC via network sockets when all code runs on the same machine (i.e. using localhost as an address):\n\nAnd here’s the server-side code for the same example:\n\nNow you can keep the server part running and call the client script to initiate data exchange:\n\nTCP-based IPC is a simple and, most importantly, cross-platform way to enable communication between processes and programs running on different platforms and different machines in the network.\n\nHowever, this method is associated with great data security concerns and requires additional use of SSL/TLS modules to ensure proper data protection. Also, keep in mind that for this method to work, the port number parameter must be unique and synchronized between the server and client code.\n\nGoogle Remote Procedure Calls (gRPC) is a vast framework for building RPC infrastructure with a focus on performance and support for various platforms and programming languages. As a communication tool, gRPC uses the protocol buffers that we described earlier.\n\nLet’s see how gRPC-based IPC works in practice.\n\nStep 1. Instal the gRPC module and tools package using the following command:\n\nThe following warehouse.proto file describes an RPC service that sends the CrateRequest structure from the client and returns the CrateResponse structure from the server:\n\nStep 3. Next, you can use gRPC tools to create language-specific files from the warehouse.proto file:\n\nAs a result, gRPC will generate two Python files:\n• warehouse_pb2.py with the request and response structures\n• warehouse_pb2_grpc.py with the client and server classes\n\nStep 4. Using the client and server classes generated in Step 3, you can now enable communication between the entities.\n\nHere’s what the code for this looks like on the client side:\n\nAnd here’s the server-side code for this IPC implementation:\n\nNow you can keep the server part running and call the client script to initiate data exchange:\n\ngRPC is comfortable to work with, as it supports multiple programming languages, allowing for seamless inter-process communication between Python and Java code, as well as with code written in C/C++ and other languages. However, working with this framework requires using the protobuf compiler for data synchronization, which adds to the complexity of the build process.\n\nAnother no-socket IPC option you may consider is the FastAPI framework. This framework allows for building Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) with Python based on standard Python 3.7+ type hints.\n\nUnderstanding what is inter-process communication in Python and how to work with it is key to building secure and efficient products. Programs and processes need to communicate with each other to effectively work with shared data.\n\nDepending on which method is used for inter-process communication in Python when you build your application, you can improve the app’s performance and ensure secure data transfer.\n\nWith a wide selection of both standard and third-party IPC tools, Python enables you to work with a variety of IPC methods that can comply with your project’s specific requirements.\n\nApriorit developers have vast experience creating secure and high-performing applications with efficient IPC mechanisms in place.

        "document": "Inter Process communication (IPC) refers to the mechanisms and techniques used by operating systems to allow different processes to communicate with each other. This allows running programs concurrently in an Operating System.\n\nThe two fundamental models of Inter Process Communication are:\n\nIPC through Shared Memory is a method where multiple processes are given access to the same region of memory. This shared memory allows the processes to communicate with each other by reading and writing data directly to that memory area.\n\nShared Memory in IPC can be visualized as Global variables in a program which are shared in the entire program but shared memory in IPC goes beyond global variables, allowing multiple processes to share data through a common memory space, whereas global variables are restricted to a single process.\n\nTo read more refer – IPC through Shared Memory\n\nIPC through Message Passing is a method where processes communicate by sending and receiving messages to exchange data. In this method, one process sends a message, and the other process receives it, allowing them to share information. Message Passing can be achieved through different methods like Sockets, Message Queues or Pipes.\n\nSockets provide an endpoint for communication, allowing processes to send and receive messages over a network. In this method, one process (the server) opens a socket and listens for incoming connections, while the other process (the client) connects to the server and sends data. Sockets can use different communication protocols, such as TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) for reliable, connection-oriented communication or UDP (User Datagram Protocol) for faster, connectionless communication.\n\nTo read more refer – IPC using Message Queues\n\nDifferent methods of Inter process Communication (IPC) are as follows:\n• Pipes – A pipe is a unidirectional communication channel used for IPC between two related processes. One process writes to the pipe, and the other process reads from it. \n\n Types of Pipes are Anonymous Pipes and Named Pipes (FIFOs)\n• Sockets – Sockets are used for network communication between processes running on different hosts. They provide a standard interface for communication, which can be used across different platforms and programming languages.\n• Shared memory – In shared memory IPC, multiple processes are given access to a common memory space. Processes can read and write data to this memory, enabling fast communication between them.\n• Semaphores – Semaphores are used for controlling access to shared resources. They are used to prevent multiple processes from accessing the same resource simultaneously, which can lead to data corruption.\n• Message Queuing – This allows messages to be passed between processes using either a single queue or several message queue. This is managed by system kernel these messages are coordinated using an API.\n\nInter-Process Communication (IPC) across the system refers to the methods that allow processes to communicate and exchange data, even when they are running on different machines or in a distributed environment.\n\nRemote Procedure Calls (RPC) allows a program to call a procedure (or function) on another machine in a network, as though it were a local call. It abstracts the details of communication and makes distributed systems easier to use. RPC is a technique used for distributed computing. It allows processes running on different hosts to call procedures on each other as if they were running on the same host.\n\nRemote Method Invocation (RMI) is a Java-based technique used for Inter-Process Communication (IPC) across systems, specifically for calling methods on objects located on remote machines. It allows a program running on one computer (the client) to execute a method on an object residing on another computer (the server), as if it were a local method call.\n\nEach method of IPC has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of which method to use depends on the specific requirements of the application. For example, if high-speed communication is required between processes running on the same host, shared memory may be the best choice. On the other hand, if communication is required between processes running on different hosts, sockets or RPC may be more appropriate.\n\nInter-Process Communication (IPC) enables processes to share data and work together through methods like Shared Memory, Message Passing, Pipes, Sockets, Semaphores, Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) and Remote Method Invocation (RMI). Each method has unique strengths suited for different scenarios, such as local or distributed systems. This page provides an overview of IPC methods, and you can explore detailed explanations and uses of each method from here."

        "document": "Inter Process Communication (IPC) is a critical concept in the world of programming and computer science. It refers to the techniques and mechanisms that enable processes to communicate and synchronize their actions when running concurrently. IPC is vital in modern computing environments where multitasking and distributed systems are commonplace.\n\nAt its core, IPC is about enabling processes to exchange data and signals. These processes could be running on the same computer or distributed across a network. The primary goal of IPC is to ensure data integrity and proper synchronization, preventing issues like data corruption or race conditions.\n• Pipes and Named Pipes: Pipes are one of the simplest forms of IPC. They create a communication channel between two processes, where one process writes data to the pipe, and the other reads from it. Named pipes are similar but can be accessed by unrelated processes, as they have a name in the file system.\n• Message Queues: Message queues allow processes to communicate through messages, which are stored in a queue. Each message is a structured block of data, making it easier to manage complex data structures.\n• Shared Memory: This method involves sharing a portion of memory between processes. It’s efficient for large data transfers, as it avoids the overhead of data copying.\n• Semaphores: Semaphores are signaling mechanisms used to control access to shared resources, ensuring that only one process accesses a resource at a time.\n• Sockets: Widely used in networked applications, sockets provide a communication link between processes over a network.\n\nIPC is used in various applications, from simple text editors to complex distributed systems. For instance, in a web server, IPC allows efficient handling of client requests by distributing tasks among multiple processes. In an operating system, IPC is crucial for system calls and managing user applications.\n\nLet’s look at a simple example of IPC using pipes in Python:\n\nIn this example, we create a pipe and write a message from the parent process. The child process then reads the message, demonstrating basic IPC using pipes.\n\nInter Process Communication is a foundational concept in programming that allows for efficient and safe communication between processes. Understanding the various types of IPC mechanisms and their appropriate use cases is essential for building robust and efficient applications. As you explore IPC further, remember to follow best practices like ensuring proper synchronization and handling exceptions gracefully."
