        "document": "Want to embed lightning-fast user-facing dashboards into your product that really look and feel native ? Check out Embeddable, our brand new platform.\n\nWhether you’re a developer or a decision-maker, delivering meaningful insights through dashboards is critical for you and your business. With the right tools, you’ll be able to focus on the data instead of struggling to build the perfect dashboard.\n\nOne such tool is Recharts, a popular, open-source charting library. In this article, we’ll explore:\n• How pairing it with Embeddable will help you create efficient, native-feeling dashboards\n\nWe’ll also discuss how to install Recharts and integrate it into your projects so you can work smoothly from the start.\n\nRecharts is a simple-to-use yet powerful charting library designed for React developers. It’s built on React and D3, combining the declarative nature of React with D3’s robust charting capabilities.\n\nAs a fully open-source project managed by a small group of contributors, Recharts is lightweight, easy to use, and flexible for creating interactive data visualizations.\n\nWhat sets Recharts apart from other libraries is its simplicity and React-specific design. Unlike more complex libraries like D3, Recharts abstracts much of the technical complexity, making it accessible even to developers with limited experience in data visualization.\n\nRecharts is also known for its simple, declarative syntax, which removes many of the struggles typically associated with building visualizations. A library like D3.js, for example, provides great customization and control, but has a steep learning curve and needs extensive coding.\n\nRecharts simplifies the process with a declarative API, allowing developers to define their charts based on what they want to achieve, rather than how to achieve it. Plus, it is completely free, unlike a library like Highcharts, which requires a paid subscription if you want to access all its features.\n\nIn terms of front-end framework compatibility, Recharts is designed specifically for React, and integrates seamlessly with its component-drive model. While this focus ensures Recharts works perfectly with React apps, it also means the library isn’t natively available for frameworks like Angular or Vue.\n\nRecharts follows a component-based architecture, where each chart element is modular and reusable. There are five main component categories:\n• Charts. These are the primary containers for rendering different visualizations. Examples include line charts, bar charts, and scatter charts. Each chart component provides core functionalities, such as accepting data via the data prop and laying the foundation for additional customization. For instance, a line chart serves as the base to which you can add lines, tooltips, or axes to display trends.\n\n2. General components. General components add auxiliary features that enhance the usability and readability of charts. Examples include tooltips, legends, and axis labels. You can easily customize these components, adjusting their styles, behavior, or positioning.\n\n‍\n\n3. Cartesian components. You can use these components when you need to work with layouts in Cartesian coordinates. For instance, “<xAxis>” and “<yAxis>” define the horizontal and vertical axis respectively, supporting ticks, labels, and grid lines. Using the Cartesian system helps you plot data points accurately and create a structured and visually consistent layout.\n\n‍\n\n4. Polar components. These components enable circular charts like pie or radar. They are useful for visualizing proportional or multivariate data, and make it easy to create and customize charts.\n\n‍\n\n5. Shapes. These are the building blocks of visual elements in Recharts, allowing developers to create custom elements. For instance, you can use the “rectangle” element to create bar segments or custom background elements. This category is perfect if you want to make advanced customization to your charts and creative designs.\n\nRecharts offers a wide variety of charts that cater to diverse data visualization needs. These fall under the following categories, with multiple variations therein:\n• Line charts: Ideal for visualizing trends over time, such as sales growth or temperature changes.\n\n‍\n• Bar charts: Perfect for categorical comparisons, like showing revenue across different regions.\n\n‍\n• Pie charts: Great for displaying proportions or parts of a whole, such as market share.\n\n‍\n• Area charts: Aesthetic and informative for overlapping data series, often used in financial or demographic analysis.\n\n‍\n• Scatter plots: Useful for visualizing relationships between variables, such as height vs. weight.\n\n‍\n• Radar charts: Ideal for multivariate data, especially when comparing metrics across different categories, such as skill assessments.\n\n‍\n• Treemaps: Excellent for representing hierarchical data in a compact and visually engaging way. Treemaps display hierarchical data using nested rectangles, showing proportions within categories, like expenses or file sizes.\n\nShould you use Recharts?\n\nIf you need a charting library, how can you know if Recharts is the right one for you? It’s excellent for a developer or team looking for a highly accessible, quick way to present data. However, its simplicity can limit projects requiring extensive customization or advanced charting features.\n• It is open source and free. There are no license costs and you can take full advantage of all its features right from the start, making it ideal for those working with a low budget.\n\n‍\n• Extensive chart types. From line charts to scatter plots and treemaps, you can build a wide variety of charts.\n\n‍\n• Ease of use. Recharts has a component-driven approach that simplifies chart creation.\n\n‍\n• Great documentation. Recharts comes with clear and concise documentation, perfect for beginners and experts alike.\n• React-only. Recharts is made for React, and sadly, that means it’s not suitable for non-React projects.\n\n‍\n• Limited customization. Its charts and customizations are generally great for most use cases, but more complex visualizations will require additional libraries or custom development. \n\n‍\n• Volunteer support. The group behind Recharts is small, which may limit support availability for advanced issues.\n\nUsers find Recharts easy to use and perfect for basic dashboards. Since this is a relatively small library compared to others like Highcharts or amCharts, there aren’t many official Recharts reviews online.\n\nBut if you look around on forums or platforms like GitHub, you’ll find people who love how lightweight Recharts is and comment that it’s the perfect charting solution if you’re working with React. Some users also like its comprehensive documentation, which makes it easy to learn even if you’re a beginner.\n\nComplaints usually relate to the lack of customizations available and the fact that it’s “nearly impossible” to get a native look when using the charts in your own applications. Others also say it’s difficult to use Recharts if you want to build complex dashboards or have a large dataset.\n\nWe look at how to manage these issues below in our section on headless embedded analytics.\n\nHow to use Recharts\n\nGetting started with Recharts requires a few easy steps.\n\nThe easiest and fastest way to install the library is using npm, with a simple line of code:\n\nAlternatively, you can find the umd build on unpkg.com.\n\nNext, you’ll need to decide what type of chart you need and import its components. For instance, if you want a line chart with xAxis, yAxis, and a Cartesian grid, you’ll need the following line of code:\n\nThe third step will usually be creating a sample dataset. For example, this could look something like:\n\nOnce you have your data, you can start customizing your chart. This can look like adding props of some components and adding interactions. You can also modify various components like editing the axis labels or creating custom shapes.\n\nThe above steps help you install and create a chart in Recharts, but that only gives you the frontend components, and frontend components alone do not make a dashboard—you’ll then need to think about transforming, modeling, and presenting the data.\n\nAnd, depending on your project, the next steps could involve setting up interactions between charts and other components like data range filters and drop-downs; setting up caching to optimize performance; and adding additional features like exporting and scheduling functionality for your users.\n\nBuilding charts with Recharts is just the start. Creating a fully functional dashboard involves significant engineering effort. This is where headless embedded analytics solutions like Embeddable come into play. Here’s how it can help.\n\nTools like Embeddable allow you to use whatever front-end charts you like (including Recharts), while it handles backend processes such as SQL query execution, caching, and advanced interactive features. You won’t need to spend days writing code from scratch to ensure high performance and security of your dashboards.\n\nInstead, you can have a complex app with a dashboard that loads perfectly and is fully native-feeling, with minimal effort.\n\nStandard embedded analytics tools require you to embed their charts, and don’t give you much flexibility on the UX and UI that you present to your customers.\n\nConversely, Embeddable lets you bring in any chart you like, from any charting library, and use it within a fully-managed embedded analytics environment that lets you deliver those custom charts in a simple, scalable and secure way with low-engineering effort.\n\nEmbeddable’s headless embedded analytics give you that native app feel, providing a seamless experience for end-users, with minimal effort for you and your developers.\n\nUnlike other tools, Embeddable uses a web component or native react embed to allow you to easily deploy dashboards into your application with a few lines of code. The charts will load natively into your DOM, meaning it’s more secure, faster to load and results in a more seamless experience for your end users. No more clunky iframes!\n\nAdditionally, whether you’ve got a single-tenant or multi-tenant database architecture, you can ensure customers only see the data they are supposed to by leveraging the simple and elegant row-level security features.\n\nSince you’re not spending time writing code and customizing everything step by step, you can save time and resources. With Embeddable, you can easily achieve the fast-loading, user-friendly dashboards you need in a fraction of the time vs. a custom in-house build.\n\nHow to use Recharts with Embeddable\n\nOnce you've installed Recharts and created your desired charts, Embeddable streamlines the rest of the building and maintenance, ensuring dashboard performance and scalability. It ensures a native feel and provides full control over your UI/UX. Here’s how to use the two together.\n\nFollow the steps outlined above to create and customize your charts. If in doubt, you can refer to Recharts’ docs for help.\n\nPush your charts to Embeddable using the SDK. The no-code builder makes everything easy from here and you’ll get your charting elements as reusable components with which even non-technical members of your team can easily build new variations of dashboards whenever you need one.\n\nUsing the no-code builder, create your dashboards. Test out different configurations and layouts, preview in-app and add features like exporting and Custom Canvas that will give your users the possibility to build their own views right from the app.\n\nFinally, embed dashboards directly in your application using Embeddable’s lightweight and secure web component (no clunky iframes, here!). A few lines of code and you’ll quickly be providing users with a powerful analytics experience.\n\nRecharts is a fantastic tool for building charts quickly and effectively in React applications. It is free and open source, comes with comprehensive documentation, and is perfect for building basic charts.\n\nHowever, further development, such as integrating it into your app, adding it to your dashboards, and customizing it for a native look, will require additional expertise, including manual coding.\n\nAlternatively, you can pair Recharts with a headless embedded analytics solution like Embeddable, which will allow you to build comprehensive, fast-loading dashboards with minimal backend effort.\n\nWhat types of data visualization can be created with Recharts?\n\nRecharts supports a variety of charts, including line, bar, pie, scatter, area, and radar charts. These cover the most common data visualization needs but for advanced charting options and more flexibility you may want to explore other charting libraries.\n\nIs Recharts compatible with React, Angular, Vanilla JS, and Vue?\n\nRecharts is designed exclusively for React, making it incompatible with frameworks like Angular or Vue without significant modifications. If you want to use Recharts in your Angular or Vue app, then you can use a headless embedded analytics tool like Embeddable which will render the react-based charts in any frontend application, whilst providing a secure, scalable and performant data service.\n\nHow customizable are the charts in Recharts for specific styling needs?\n\nRecharts allows basic styling through props and components, but for highly customized visualizations, you may need to extend its functionality or use additional libraries. If you need to create interactions between charts and add advanced features for your users, though, you’ll either need to write manual code or pair it with a tool like Embeddable, which will help you deliver native-feeling dashboards to your customers with minimal effort."

You build your charts using Recharts components and only bring in custom components, such as , when and where you need it.\n\nWe do not wrap Recharts. This means you're not locked into an abstraction. When a new Recharts version is released, you can follow the official upgrade path to upgrade your charts.\n\nThe components are yours.\n\nLet's build your first chart.

        "document": "Over the summer of 2021 I started working for an Internet of Things (IoT) startup, Blues Wireless that aims to make IoT development easy - even when reliable Internet connections are not available. Blues does this via Notecards - prepaid cellular devices that can be embedded into any IoT device \"on the edge\" to transmit sensor data as JSON to a secure cloud: Notehub.\n\nI am not a hardware or firmware engineer however, web development is my area of expertise (frontend in particular), so to dip my toes into IoT development, I started off building a simpler project: an asset tracker using only a Blues Notecard, Blues Notecarrier AL with a built-in GPS antenna, and a small lithium-ion polymer (LiPo) battery to power it all.\n\nWith the help of the Blues developer experience docs, I had temperature, voltage, and GPS location data being delivered to the Notehub cloud from my tracker in under 30 minutes. That's cool and all, but the way that data from sensors in the world really becomes useful is when it's displayed to users in some sort of UI, right? It could be maps, tables, or in my case, charts.\n\nSo I wanted to take my data from the Notehub cloud and pump it into a custom-made dashboard to track and display the Notecard's location, voltage, and sensor readings in the real world. React is my current JavaScript framework of choice, and I decided to build a Next.js TypeScript-powered dashboard, and I learned a ton of interesting things in the process, which I intend to share with you over a series of blog posts in the next few months.\n\nToday, I plan to show you how to build charts and a custom styled tooltip in a Next.js application with the Recharts Library, using real-world data from a third-party API source.\n\nHere's what the final dashboard looks like - the temperature and voltage charts are the focus for this particular post.\n\nNOTE This article will not go through the initial setup of a brand new Next.js app - that's outside the scope of this blog. If you're starting from scratch, I would recommend following the Next.js starter app with TypeScript documentation.\n\nTo get started adding charts to our Next.js application, we have to install the Recharts library. Recharts is a chart library built with React and the popular data visualization library D3, and it makes it easy to use React-based chart components that feel familiar to make all sorts of different types of charts, while still allowing a high degree of flexibility for customization, as needed.\n\nInstall the Recharts library in the Next.js app with the following commands in a terminal.\n\nThis is the only new library needed to get Recharts up and running, even when using TypeScript, so it's time to move on and make some various chart components.\n\nThe first type of chart component we'll create for the dashboard will be used to display the temperature data supplied by the Notecard. This will be an area chart that looks like the image here.\n\nSince this component will have the sole goal of displaying temperature data, create a new file in the repo named , and paste the following code into it. The actual code in GitHub is available by clicking the file title below.\n\nThere's a lot of imports from Recharts happening in this component, so let's go through them one by one to understand what their purposes are.\n\nEach of the imports from the library at the very top of the file represent a different component used to make this chart display correctly.\n• is the container for all the chart data and is how Recharts knows what type of chart it's rendering.\n• is where the array of data to be displayed by the chart is passed. The and properties in the component allow us to define the chart's line color and fill color as hex codes.\n• XAxis and YAxis are how the chart knows what the X and Y axes of the chart should use as their data displays.\n• The property inside of the axis component is the property name of the array data being passed to the chart. For example, each item in the array of data being passed to the temperature chart's has a property of , so that is the for the component.\n• must always be a child component of the or component and it displays a custom axis label.\n• I like it because the chart label, label angle, value, positioning, and more can be changed very easily here.\n• draws the nice squares which align with the cartesian coordinate axes.\n• This is not a required component, but I think it improves chart readability. The property is customizable, so feel free to play with the numbers to find a square pattern that suits you.\n• although our tooltip will end up being a custom component, in order to display it the custom one, we must pass it into the generic component as the property . We'll get into this more when we create the tooltip component, so put a pin in this for now.\n• wraps the whole chart component and makes it responsive to the size of the parent container. Although the chart component itself can be given a and , they're static. When passing the component width and height props, one should be a percentage string.\n• For my component, the is , for this reason.\n\nThe only other import to this file is the component and we'll get to this component in depth soon.\n\nAfter all the imports, the are defined for the TypeScript array of data being passed to this chart. The are pretty simple: each object in the array will contain:\n• A (this is a simplified date format of MM/DD/YYYY) to display in the component,\n• A - the longer form date of MMM D, YYYY h:mm A to display in the tooltip,\n\nFinally, all of these chart components are composed in the JSX to make a responsive area chart with dates on the X axis, temperature on the Y axis, a lavender stroke and fill color, and a custom tooltip.\n\nThe second chart component we're going to build is for the Notecard's voltage levels over time. The Notecard is designed to be ultra low power so even small batteries can power it for long stretches of time (multiple years, even), but it's still good to keep an eye on the voltage so if it does start to drop, the LiPo battery can be recharged or swapped out.\n\nThis component will be a standard line chart instead of an area chart, so create a new component file named in your project.\n\nA lot of the code for the component should feel familiar when you read over it - it's quite similar to the component's code. As before, you can click the file title to go the GitHub code.\n\nAs with the , the imports all the same Recharts components except it uses and to indicate that this chart will be displayed as a line chart instead of an area chart and tell the component the will be an unbroken type with a soft green color.\n\nBeyond these key differences everything else is much the same: same chart wrapper, similarly shaped array (the property on each object is replaced by here), same X and Y axis data (although this Y axis has a property that sets the upper and lower bounds of the chart), and even the same component.\n\nSo now that we've defined our charts, it's time to dive into that component.\n\nThis is where things stopped being so straightforward. If we examine the Recharts tooltip API documentation closely, you'll see mention of the method as a way to render a custom tooltip, lucky for us, this method links to example code so we can see what props a custom tooltip component can take, including CSS styling.\n\nHere is what our custom tooltip is going to end up looking like.\n\nIn the app, make a new component file named , and go ahead and make a new style file named .\n\nThe component here takes in two props:\n• - a boolean denoting if a tooltip should be displayed (this happens when a user mouses over the chart on desktop or clicks on a particular point on mobile),\n• - the data the tooltip will be displaying from the chart. For us, we want the chart's temp (or voltage) and the more specific timestamp in our tooltip.\n\nThe custom tooltip's JSX checks if is true for a particular data point and if the exists as a single object in the array. If both conditions are met, the tooltip displays the longer format date and either the temperature or voltage depending on which chart the tooltip's being invoked with.\n\nOur data's being displayed in the tooltip, now to give it a little styling to look decent.\n\nThe class wraps all the tooltip data, giving it a white background, black text with a little padding, a slight box shadow, and some nicely rounded corners. Nested inside of this class are which defines some margins around the text, and , which gives extra emphasis to the font.\n\nThen import the SCSS file into the component file, define the module's name as and plug in the corresponding CSS in the correct components in the JSX. Now when this component is imported into the two chart components, it should look good and display the more specific tooltip data we want.\n\nWith that done, we're ready to start using these components in the dashboard page.\n\nRender the charts in the application\n\nOk, so in the main file where all our dashboard components are imported, let's add our charts and prepare to pass data to them.\n\nThere's not much to these imports, they're standard default imports to get these components into the file. After the two chart components are imported, they're rendered inside of the JSX down at the bottom of the file. The function at the bottom of the file that I've written a comment for is where the Notehub data gets pulled into the app, and the comment right under our line is where we'll transform that raw data into the and arrays that our charts need.\n\nLet's get to it.\n\nPull in data for the charts\n\nIn my previous asset tracking dashboard article I went into great detail about how to create your own asset tracker to generate real data for the app using Blues Wireless hardware and a data fetching function.\n\nIf you'd like to follow along there to build your own tracker and route data to Notehub, please be my guest.\n\nFor this post, I'll jump ahead to the part where we're already pulling data into the app via a Next.js API call. The JSON data from the Notehub cloud looks like this:\n\nEach JSON object in this array is a separate motion event that displays the Notecard's current location and sensor readings. The part of the object that we care about in this particular post is the and values. This is the data our charts need.\n\nTake that data and reshape it to work with our chart and tooltip components\n\nWith the correct shape of our data being fed into our app (either via and Notehub) or the JSON test data I shared above, it's time to reshape this data.\n\nI've condensed down the logic to make this file easier to read, but you can see the full file on GitHub.\n\nHere's what's happening in this file, we declare two new React state variables: and - these arrays are what get passed to the chart components. Each of these variables is an object with three properties: , , and either or .\n\nThen, inside of a function that runs as soon as the variable is available via the call, we sort the data, and then iterate over each object in the original array and create a new and from the data that gets pushed into the and variables declared at the very top of the .\n\nFinally, those arrays are set into the component's state with our variables. At this point, you should have a couple of nice looking charts displaying a few points of data about your Notecard's voltage and temperature.\n\nOnce I started working for an IoT startup, getting more familiar with the possibilities of what sensors could report from the real world became more of a focus for me - but still from a web development perspective. To that end, I built a web dashboard pulling data from our hardware devices out in the field: location, temperature, battery voltage, etc.\n\nFor the data like temperature and voltage, charts seemed most appropriate to display the changing values over time, and so I chose the Recharts library to help with these data visualizations. The library's easy to work with and produces some nifty looking charts without too much effort on my part, and when I wanted to style my own tooltip and display some custom data, that was straightforward too.\n\nThis dashboard actually came in handy when my parents' car was stolen from their driveway the night after Thanksgiving. If you want to hear the whole story and build your own tracker, check out this blog post and video I made for Blues Wireless - it details the whole process from hardware to software to deploying to Netlify.\n\nCheck back in a few weeks — I’ll be writing more about JavaScript, React, IoT, or something else related to web development.\n\nThanks for reading. I hope you enjoyed learning how to create a couple of charts and custom tooltips using the Recharts library - slick data visualizations have so many potential applications for transforming lots of data points into meaningful data people can draw conclusions from."

        "document": "This article was last updated on November 5, 2024 to include performance optimization tips and responsive design techniques for improved chart rendering in Recharts.\n\nCharts make it easy to represent complex data in a simple and visually appealing way. With charts, you can easily identify trends and patterns and make comparisons across different variables and data types. You can use charts to interpret current data and predict the future.\n\nThere are several types of charts you can use to visually represent data. Some of them include Line Charts, Bar Charts, Area Charts, and Scatter charts. The choice of a chart largely depends on the type of data. Different types of charts are suited for different purposes.\n\nThere are several libraries for creating charts in the React ecosystem. These React chart libraries include react-flow-charts, react-financial-charts, react-charts and Recharts. In this article, we will explore how to create charts in a Refine project using Recharts.\n\nWhat we will cover:\n• Recharts Performance Optimization with Large Data Sets\n• Limit Data Points to Display Only What's Necessary\n• How to Make Recharts Responsive for Different Screen Sizes\n\nRecharts is a popular, MIT-licensed library for creating charts in React and React-based frameworks like refine. Internally, it uses SVG and some lightweight D3 packages as its dependencies.\n\nRecharts has several built-in components that you can compose to create some of the commonest charts such as Area charts, Bar charts, Pie charts, and Line charts.\n\nAs an example, the code below illustrates how you can use Rechart's built-in components to create a Bar chart. The component names are self-explanatory.\n\nIn this section, we will create a Refine demo project.\n\nSelect the options below when prompted by the command line tool.\n\nAfter setting up the project and installing dependencies, use the command below to launch the development server.\n\nLater in this article, we will create charts using Recharts and render them in a dashboard. Let's add a dashboard to the project we have just created.\n\nCreate the file. Copy and paste the code below into it. Be aware that the directory doesn't exist yet. You need to first create it.\n\nThe component above renders a simple \"Hello world!\" text at the moment. We will add more code to it later. Now we need to export the component above. Create the file. Copy and paste the code below into it.\n\nYou can now import the component we created above and render it in the component. Add the changes below to the file.\n\nIn the code above, we added another data provider. The data provider will fetch data from the fast foods API. It's a dummy API created by the Refine team. You can use it to create simple projects when testing out refine. We will use the API to create charts later.\n\nYou will now see a dashboard entry in the sidebar. The dashboard will look like the image below. We will create charts and render them in the dashboard in the next sub-sections.\n\nBefore we start creating charts, let's create a simple interface for the data from our API. Create the file. Copy and paste the interface below into it.\n\nYou can install Recharts either from the npm package registry or get its UMD build via a CDN. Depending on your package manager, use one of the commands below to install Recharts.\n\nLine charts consist of a series of data points connected using line segments. They are mostly used to represent time series data. You can use Rechart's built-in component to create a Line chart like so:\n\nCharts in general need to have features such as axes, Cartesian grid, legend, and tooltips. Therefore, we need to use the component with Rechart's built-in general and Cartesian components as in the example above.\n\nThe component has the prop for passing the data you want to represent on the Line chart. The data should be an array of objects like in the example below.\n\nLet's create a simple Line chart in our Refine project. We will render it in the dashboard we created above. Start by creating the file. Copy and paste the code below into it. The directory doesn't exist yet. Start by creating it.\n\nIn the example above, the component is wrapped in a responsive container. We will do the same while creating other charts later. We need to export the component we created above so that we can easily import and render it anywhere in our project. Create the file. Copy and paste the code below into it.\n\nLet's now import the above component and render it in the component. Copy and paste the code below into the file.\n\nIn the code above, we are using the hook to make custom query requests to the backend. The hook uses TanStack Query's hook under the hook. We have been querying the daily revenue, daily orders, and new customers of a restaurant business for the last seven days. We will represent the data in different types of charts. The dashboard should now have a Line chart that looks like the image below.\n\nThere are several Line chart variants you can create using Rechart's built-in components. For more complex charts, check out the Recharts documentation.\n\nRecharts has the built-in component for creating area charts. You can compose the built-in component to create complex area charts in your React project.\n\nYou can use the component's prop to pass the data you want to represent on an area chart. Like in the previous example, your data should be an array of objects.\n\nTo represent the above data in an area chart, you can use the component as in the example below. As before, the component names are self-explanatory.\n\nLet's now add an area chart to the Refine project we created above. Create the file. Copy and paste the code below into it.\n\nIn the example above, we are representing the daily revenue of a restaurant business in an area chart. We are fetching the data in our dashboard component and passing it as a prop to the above component. Once again we are wrapping the area chart in a responsive container.\n\nYou need to export the above component by adding the changes below to the file.\n\nYour dashboard should now have a simple area chart that looks like the image below.\n\nThere are several types of Area charts. What we have created above is a simple Area chart. Recharts has built-in functionality for implementing most of them. For more, check out the documentation.\n\nBar charts are among the most common charts for visualizing data. You can use it to visually represent categorical data. Recharts has the built-in component for creating bar charts.\n\nLike the other types of charts, the data you want to represent on a bar chart should be an array of objects. You need to pass it to the component as the value of the prop.\n\nLet's add a bar chart to the dashboard in the Refine project we created above. Create the file. Copy and paste the code below into it.\n\nWe need to export the component above. Add the changes below to the file.\n\nWe can now import and render the above component. Add the changes below to the file.\n\nAfter rendering the above component, your dashboard should now have a bar chart that looks like the image below.\n\nScatter charts are useful to graphically represent the relationship between two variables. Like the other charts mentioned above, Recharts has the built-in component for creating scatter charts.\n\nLet's create a simple scatter chart in this article. Create the file. Copy and paste the code below into it.\n\nIn the example above, we wrapped the chart in a responsive container and passed the data to the component instead of the . Similar to the other charts we have already looked at, the data should be an array of objects.\n\nIn the example above, we had to transform the data because we wanted to determine the relationship between two variables(daily orders and new customers).\n\nLet's export the above component. Add the changes below to the file.\n\nYou can now import and render the above component in the dashboard. Add the changes below to the file.\n\nAfter rendering the above component, the dashboard should now have a scatter chart that looks like the image below.\n\nA pie chart is one of the most common and easy-to-understand charts. It is a circular graph that is split into multiple sectors. Each sector in a pie chart represents a particular category of data and its size is proportional to the quantity of the category it represents.\n\nIn this section, we will create a simple Pie chart using Recharts. Let's start by creating the file. Copy and paste the code below into it.\n\nLet's export the above component so that we can import it anywhere in our application. Add the changes below to the file.\n\nLet's import and render the above component in our dashboard. Add the changes below to the file.\n\nYour dashboard should now have a Pie chart that looks like the image below.\n\nA Treemap is a data visualization tool similar to a Pie chart. However, instead of using a circular graph and sectors to represent data, a Treemap instead uses rectangles and nested rectangles.\n\nWith a Treemap, a rectangle represents a category, and nested rectangles represent sub-categories within a category. Recharts has the built-in component for creating Treemaps. You can pass the data as the value of the data attribute.\n\nLet's add a simple Treemap to our dashboard. Create the file. Copy and paste the code below into it.\n\nIn the example above, we have hard-coded the data because the API doesn't have a dataset we can use to create a Treemap. In a typical real-world project, you will retrieve the data from an API. You can export the above component from the file like so:\n\nYour dashboard should now have a Treemap that looks like the image below.\n\nI have been researching the best practices to keep Recharts performing well, especially with larger datasets, and wanted to pass on a few tips that might help keep things smooth. Recharts is good for data visualization, but small adjustments can make all the difference when working with sizable chunks of data. Here's what I came up with:\n\nThe performance can really slow down when dealing with a time series or high-frequency data, especially if it tries to render each and every data point. The solution is straightforward: limit the number of data points or summarize data. For example, you might display every 10th data point or use averages for simpler overviews.\n\nIf your chart data or settings aren’t changing on every render, use React.memo or PureComponent to prevent unnecessary updates. This is especially useful with big data sets or complex charts.\n\nUsing memo ensures that LineChartComponent only re-renders if the data prop changes.\n\nRecharts renders using SVG, so reducing the number of elements in the SVG will help performance. For example, remove grid lines, extra labels, or multiple tooltips if they’re not necessary.\n\nThis keeps the chart minimal and improves performance.\n\nIf you have multiple charts on a page, consider lazy-loading them as the user scrolls. This improves initial load times by rendering charts only when visible. You can use react-intersection-observer for easy implementation.\n\nSetting loads the chart only when it first comes into view, conserving resources if the user doesn’t scroll down.\n\nI’ve put together some tips on making Recharts charts responsive to different screen sizes. Recharts itself has some built-in features for responsiveness, but a few tweaks can make sure the charts look great on both desktop and mobile.\n\nRecharts provides a component that allows the chart to automatically resize to fit its container. Wrapping charts in this component is a quick way to make them responsive:\n\nHere, width=\"100%\" makes the chart resize to fit the container width, while height={300} keeps the height fixed.\n\nFor charts that need to maintain consistent proportions (like in grids), you can set an aspect ratio in ResponsiveContainer. This keeps the chart’s proportions uniform across different screens:\n\nSetting aspect={4 / 3} means the height will adjust according to the width, preserving a 4:3 ratio and preventing stretching on wide or narrow screens.\n\nSome elements like tooltips, labels, or legends may need to be hidden or resized on smaller screens. You can use CSS media queries to style these elements conditionally or use JavaScript to control visibility based on screen width:\n\nIn this example, we use useMediaQuery to adjust the chart’s height and hide the legend on smaller screens.\n\nUsing Recharts on smaller screens may require padding and margin adjustments to prevent elements from overlapping. Setting smaller margins on mobile can help avoid crowding:\n\nThese recommendations should make it easier to design charts that adapt well to any screen size, ensuring a better user experience across devices.\n\nSometimes you may have to integrate data visualization in your React project. Charts make it easy to present data in an easy-to-understand and visually appealing way.\n\nThere are several frameworks for creating charts in React. Recharts is one of the most popular and feature-rich packages for creating charts in a React project or React-based frameworks such as refine.\n\nRecharts support several types of charts out of the box. In this article, we have only explored a subset of charts you can create using Recharts. Check the documentation for details."

        "document": "Customization lies at the heart of creating unique and impactful data visualizations. While Recharts provides numerous built-in components, understanding how to create custom shapes and components opens up endless possibilities for tailoring charts to specific needs and brand requirements.\n\nCustom shapes in Recharts allow you to replace default visual elements with your own designs. These can range from simple geometric shapes to complex SVG paths, enabling you to create distinctive chart elements that align perfectly with your visualization goals.\n\nLet's explore how to create a custom shape for a bar chart:\n\nCustom components provide even more flexibility by allowing you to build entirely new chart elements. These components can interact with Recharts' internal systems while maintaining complete control over rendering and behavior.\n\nOne common use case is creating custom tooltips:\n\nUnderstanding how custom components integrate with Recharts' lifecycle is crucial for optimal performance:\n\nWhen working with custom components, performance considerations become crucial. Implement memoization for complex calculations and limit unnecessary rerenders:\n\nCustom shapes and components in Recharts provide the flexibility needed to create unique, branded visualizations while maintaining the library's core functionality. By understanding these concepts and implementing them thoughtfully, you can create powerful, performant, and visually distinctive charts that perfectly match your requirements."

        "document": "Like any other charting library, Recharts allows you to work with line series data. A line chart has a lot of varied use cases. A very basic example is using a line series chart to show progress of something over time, like, how sales of smartphones has increased over the years. It is very easy to create a simple line chart out of the box in Recharts.\n\nA simple static line chart is usually never enough for our data visualization needs. You would probably need to show some extra information like reference lines on the chart to mark important events, reference areas to mark important periods, adding extra information to the chart with Tooltips, etc. One such usage is to show the line chart in different colors before and after an important event. For example, we might want to show a different color for the smartphone data before iPhone was launched, and a different color after iPhone was launched.\n\nOne naive approach to this in any charting library would be to have 2 different line series, one which renders the data before the reference event and another which renders the data after the event, \n\nOR \n\none line which displays the full data, and another line which only displays data before the event and renders on top of the other line with a different color.\n\nBoth of these approaches have some drawbacks:\n• If you are drawing two different lines which have different starting points, both of them would be animated separately in Recharts, and the effect would not seem like a single line chart with different colors.\n• If you draw two different lines with different end points, then based on the type of interpolation, your charts might not overlap appropriately towards the end of the shorter line.\n\nBoth of the above cases can be fixed by either choosing the appropriate interpolation type, or may be overriding animations, but this seems like an overkill to achieve what we want.\n\nThere might be an easier and less hack-y way to do this. Since these lines are elements and they accept a , what if we could somehow change the color of based on the data? What if we could use a syntax like this:\n\nSadly, this is not yet allowed by Recharts.\n\nCurrently Recharts allows to only provide for the whole line. This means we can change the color of the whole line based on some data, but we cannot do that for different parts of the line chart.\n\nBut, we have a workaround. Since these line charts are elements, we can pass in a as the .\n\nThis opens up a whole new set of possibilities, you can, for instance change the for different parts of the chart on user interaction.\n\nThis capability to provide a based on gradient is not specific to Recharts, but is applicable across all based charting libraries which allow you to pass in a same as you pass to any other element.\n\nA list of all other posts in this series:\n• Exploring Recharts: What can be rendered inside a Recharts contianer ?\n• Exploring Recharts: LineChart with different colored segments for a single Line"
