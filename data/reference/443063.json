It worked for me perfectly (tested on Rider 2023.3.3 e.g.). No real need to upgrade anything yet (YMMV).\n\nIf you want to have a plug-and-play fix that requires no changes in the app paths etc. (e.g. for integration with other tools that require you to supply a correct IDE starter path), you can ever use a simple wrapper executable, like the one generated by the code below:\n\n, then just name the compiled exec e.g. and put it where the original app resides, copy the to there, and you're good to go; this works as a simple-but-effective workaround for virtually all cases when you need an and you have a (using the bat2exe etc. tools from 'net is usually a bad idea IMVHO, they are prone to different caveats)."

        "document": "By default, IntelliJ IDEA is configured to check for updates automatically and notify you when a new version is available. Updates are usually patch-based: they are applied to the existing installation and only require you to restart the IDE. However, sometimes patch updates are not available, and a new version of IntelliJ IDEA must be installed.\n\nWhen IntelliJ IDEA updates to a new major release, it opens the What's New in IntelliJ IDEA tab in the editor with information about the changes, improvements, and fixes. To open this tab manually, select Help | What's New in IntelliJ IDEA.\n\nIf IntelliJ IDEA does not have HTTP access outside your local network, it will not be able to check for updates and apply patches. In this case, you have to download new versions of the IDE and install them manually as described in Standalone installation.\n\nIf you installed IntelliJ IDEA using the Toolbox App, it will suggest that you update the IDE when a new version is available.\n• None Open the Toolbox App, click the Toolbox App menu icon in the top right corner, and select Settings.\n• None In the Toolbox App Settings dialog, expand Tools and select Update all tools automatically. If you disable this option, you will need to click Update next to any instance when a newer version comes out. You can also configure the update policy for every managed IDE instance separately.\n• None Open the Toolbox App, click next to the relevant IDE instance, and select Settings.\n• None In the instance settings dialog, select the update channel to use for this IDE instance:\n• None Release: Update only to stable releases that are recommended for production.\n• None Early Access Program: Includes updates to release candidates , beta releases, and EAP builds, which are not recommended for production and include feature previews.\n\nIf you installed IntelliJ IDEA manually, the standalone IDE instance will manage its own updates. It will notify you when a new version is available. You can choose to update the current instance, download and install the new version as a separate instance, postpone the notification, or ignore the update entirely. To manage the IntelliJ IDEA update policy, open Settings and select Appearance & Behavior | System Settings | Updates. If the IDE instance is managed by the Toolbox App, these settings will affect only plugin updates. The Updates page contains the following settings: Select whether you want IntelliJ IDEA to check for new versions of plugins automatically. Manually check for updates immediately. If there are updates available, you will see the same dialog as when the IDE checks for updates automatically. Alternatively, go to Help | Check for Updates on Windows or Linux, or IntelliJ IDEA | Check for Updates on macOS. Show the list of updates that were ignored. These updates will not be suggested until you remove them from the list of ignored updates. If you remove several updates from the ignored list, only the most recent will be offered for download when you check for updates.

When you run IntelliJ IDEA for the first time, you can take several steps to complete the installation, customize your instance, and start working with the IDE. For more information, refer to Run IntelliJ IDEA for the first time. For more information about the location of the default IDE directories with user-specific files, refer to Directories used by the IDE.\n\nSilent installation is performed without any user interface. It can be used by network administrators to install IntelliJ IDEA on a number of machines and avoid interrupting other users. To perform silent install, run the installer with the following switches:\n• None : Specify the path to the silent configuration file\n• None : Specify the path to the installation directory This parameter must be the last in the command line, and it should not contain any quotes even if the path contains blank spaces.\n• None : Disable the CRC check if you want to suppress the Verifying Installer popup. To check for issues during the installation process, add the switch with the log file path and name between the and parameters. The installer will generate the specified log file. For example: You can download the default silent configuration file for IntelliJ IDEA at https://download.jetbrains.com/idea/silent.config The silent configuration file defines the options for installing IntelliJ IDEA. With the default options, silent installation is performed only for the current user: . If you want to install IntelliJ IDEA for all users, change the value of the installation mode option to and run the installer as an administrator. The default silent configuration file is unique for each JetBrains product. You can modify it to enable or disable various installation options as necessary. It is possible to perform silent installation without the configuration file. In this case, omit the switch and run the installer as an administrator. Without the silent configuration file, the installer will ignore all additional options: it will not create desktop shortcuts, add associations, or update the variable. However, it will still create a shortcut in the Start menu under JetBrains.\n\nIntelliJ IDEA installed via snap may encounter issues including performance degradation, problems with JavaScript debugging using Chromium (WEB-38511), difficulties importing SBT projects (SCL-17169), and delays in file management operations (IJPL-1234). If you experience these issues, we recommend installing IntelliJ IDEA via the Toolbox App for a potentially smoother experience. You can install IntelliJ IDEA as a self-contained snap package. Since snaps update automatically, your IntelliJ IDEA installation will always be up-to-date. To use snaps, install and run the snapd service as described in the snapd installation guide. On Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and later, this service is pre-installed. IntelliJ IDEA is distributed via two channels:\n• None The stable channel includes only stable versions. To install the latest stable release of IntelliJ IDEA, run the following command: The option is required because the IntelliJ IDEA snap requires full access to the system, like a traditionally packaged application.\n• None The edge channel includes EAP builds. To install the latest EAP build of IntelliJ IDEA, run the following command: When the snap is installed, you can launch it by running the or command.\n• None To check the list of available versions, run the following command:\n• None To install the version you want, run the following command: For more information about other snap commands, refer to the Snapcraft documentation."
