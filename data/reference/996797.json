In Python, the function allows you to capture user input from the keyboard, while you can use the function to display output to the console.\n\nThese built-in functions allow for basic user interaction in Python scripts, enabling you to gather data and provide feedback. If you want to go beyond the basics, then you can even use them to develop applications that are not only functional but also user-friendly and responsive.\n\nBy the end of this tutorial, you’ll know how to:\n• Take user input from the keyboard with\n• Display output to the console with\n• Use to improve the user experience when collecting input on UNIX-like systems\n• Format output using the and keyword arguments of\n\nTo get the most out of this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of Python syntax and familiarity with using the Python interpreter and running Python scripts.\n\nPrograms often need to obtain data from users, typically through keyboard input. In Python, one way to collect user input from the keyboard is by calling the function: The function pauses program execution to allow you to type in a line of input from the keyboard. Once you press the key, all characters typed are read and returned as a string, excluding the newline character generated by pressing . If you add text in between the parentheses, effectively passing a value to the optional argument, then displays the text you entered as a prompt: \"Please enter your name: \" Please enter your name: John Doe Adding a meaningful prompt will assist your user in understanding what they’re supposed to input, which makes for a better user experience. The function always reads the user’s input as a string. Even if you type characters that resemble numbers, Python will still treat them as a string: File , line , in : can only concatenate str (not \"int\") to str In the example above, you wanted to add to the number entered by the user. However, the expression on line 7 doesn’t work because is a string ( ) and is an integer. In Python, you can’t combine a string and an integer using the plus ( ) operator. You wanted to perform a mathematical operation using two integers, but because always returns a string, you need a way to read user input as a numeric type. So, you’ll need to convert the string to the appropriate type: In this updated code snippet, you use to convert the user input to an integer right after collecting it. Then, you assign the converted value to the name . That way, the calculation has two integers to add. The calculation succeeds and Python returns the correct sum. Note: When you convert user input to a numeric type using functions like in a real-world scenario, it’s crucial to handle potential exceptions to prevent your program from crashing due to invalid input. The function lets you collect information from your users. But once your program has calculated a result, how do you display it back to them? Up to this point, you’ve seen results displayed automatically as output in the interactive Python interpreter session. However, if you ran the same code from a file instead, then Python would still calculate the values, but you wouldn’t see the results. To display output in the console, you can use Python’s function, which lets you show text and data to your users.\n\nIn addition to obtaining data from the user, a program will often need to present data back to the user. In Python, you can display data to the console with the function. To display objects to the console, you pass them as a comma-separated list of arguments to . By default, the output that produces separates objects by a single space and appends a newline to the end of the output: You can specify any type of object as an argument to . If an object isn’t a string, then converts it to an appropriate string representation before displaying it: As you can see, you can display complex types like lists, dictionaries, and even functions to the console with .\n\nCombining Python Input and Output in a Practical Example Now that you know how to read input from users with and display output with , you can combine these tools to create a small two-line program that greets a user by their name. The program will start by prompting the user to enter their name and capture that input using . Then, you can use to output a personalized greeting that includes the entered name: \"Please enter your name: \" The script introduces a small interaction with your user. When the program runs, it temporarily pauses, awaiting input from the user. Once the user provides their name and presses the key, the program immediately responds with a warm greeting: Note that automatically adds spaces between arguments when concatenating multiple arguments into a single string. The small program in collects user input and responds with console output in only two lines of code:\n• Line 1 prompts the user with a helpful message. The function then collects the user’s response as a string, which you assign to the variable.\n• Line 2 assembles a custom greeting using hardcoded strings and the value stored in . The function combines the greeting with the user’s input and displays it to the console. This example brings together the and functions to accomplish a specific purpose, using the strengths of each function:\n• gathers user data, making the program interactive and adaptable to different users.\n• displays feedback based on that data, which allows the program to communicate its response to the user in a friendly, personalized way. In a real-world application, these basic tools can support more complex workflows. For example, after welcoming a user, your program might offer further options or prompt them for more specific input to guide them through a process. Expand the collapsible section below to continue practicing with a slightly more complex example: Create a guess-the-number game where a player only has one shot at getting the right answer. You can use the function from Python’s module to let your program pick a random number: Then, your program should prompt the player to enter a number using . You can then use conditional statements to take different actions, depending on whether the user guessed the correct number or not. Keep in mind that you’ll have to read the user input as an integer in order to successfully compare it to the randomly generated number. Give it a try and write the code for this small game. Once you have a working solution—or if you get really stuck—you can check the example solution in the collapsible section below. If you’ve successfully built the guess-the-number game and you want another challenge, then you can expand the collapsible section below for a second task: Write a text-based adventure game where the player can choose whether to attack or run using . Try to implement a game loop using indefinite iteration and allow your code to take different actions depending on conditional logic. Keep it small and don’t go overboard—unless you really want to, of course! You can check out an example solution for a minimal implementation of this game by expanding the collapsible section following this one. Collecting user input and displaying data back to the user comes in handy in many scenarios. Can you think of another practical use case? If you do, share your thoughts in the comments section below.\n\nIn the previous sections, you explored how the function allows your program to pause and wait for the user to provide information. However, depending on the operating system and shell that you’re working with, the standard may have some limitations that can affect user experience. Note: If you’re on Windows 10 or newer, then you can skip this section. Windows 10 shipped with console improvements that allow for improved keyboard editing and selection. This works natively on Command Prompt and PowerShell. In some configurations, specifically on UNIX-like systems and Windows versions before Windows 10, you’ll notice that you can’t use arrow keys for navigating through typed characters or to recall previously entered commands: This can become cumbersome in interactive programs where users might want to correct mistakes or quickly repeat commands. There’s a straightforward way to improve input functionality just by importing an additional module. The module that you can use depends on whether you’re on a UNIX-like system or on Windows, so make sure to select your operating system from the options below: If you’re on a Windows version above Windows 10, then you don’t need to do anything. Advanced input editing capabilities and history recall are natively supported in Command Prompt and PowerShell since Windows 10. You can try running the code that you’ll see further down without importing the module, and you should still have access to all of the mentioned features. However, if you’re working on a Windows version before Windows 10, then you need to install a third-party library to get access to this functionality. One such library is , which you can install with Python’s package manager, : After the installation is done, the library will provide similar functionality to the GNU Readline library available on UNIX-like systems. While it mimics the behavior of the module from Python’s standard library, is not a direct substitute as it may have differences due to underlying system variations. The file of the third-party project ensures that when you import in your Python code, your code will instead use the implementation. UNIX-like systems, such as macOS and Linux, usually come with the GNU Readline library preinstalled. Python’s module provides an interface to the GNU Readline library, which straightforwardly handles the aforementioned limitations of . Because is part of Python’s standard-library, you don’t even need to install anything. To activate the improved input functionality in your input interface, you only need to import : Try running the code snippet above, which drops you into an infinite loop that allows you to test input editing and history recall:\n• Use the and arrow keys to navigate within the input line.\n• Use and to move to the beginning and end of the input line, respectively.\n• Recall previous inputs using the and arrow keys. You can exit the loop that you set up in and end the example program by typing . Usually, when you call , it calls a lower-level input handling function to wait for user input from the standard input stream. When you import , it overrides the standard input processing by registering handlers for keyboard input. These handlers capture each key press, interpreting special keys like arrows differently. The readline module achieves this seamlessly because instead of changing , it intercepts calls to the lower-level read commands that relies on. When calls these commands, steps in and provides its enhanced behavior. Integrating enhanced input features can significantly improve the user experience, especially in interactive applications like command-line tools or games: This enhancement is particularly valuable in scenarios where users are expected to input commands frequently or make complex entries with frequent edits. It’s important to note that the features provided by and are natively supported only in console environments and may not work in all Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). IDEs often handle input differently from standard terminal environments. Additionally, some key bindings and functionalities may vary depending on the system configuration and the specific implementation of the module. By extending the capabilities of , your programs can offer a more robust and user-friendly interface, accommodating smoother data entry and manipulation processes. In the next section, you’ll continue to explore how you can refine output appearance and formatting using some advanced features of .\n\nThe function takes additional arguments that provide some control over the format of the output. Each of these is a special type of argument called a keyword argument. Keyword arguments have the form . You need to pass them at the end, after the list of objects that you want to display. Note: You can only achieve basic formatting of console output with . If you need more precise control over the appearance of your data, then you can use Python’s f-strings to format the object before passing it to . In this section, you’ll see how the following keyword arguments affect the console output that produces:\n• : This argument allows you to specify how to separate multiple objects when they are printed.\n• : Use this argument to set what Python prints at the end of a call.\n• : This allows you to redirect the output to any file-like object.\n• : Use this argument to flush the output stream, effectively bypassing any buffering. Adding the keyword argument causes Python to separate objects by instead of by the default single space: In these examples, you’ve used different strings, such as , , and to separate the objects that you’re asking to display. You can use the keyword to specify any arbitrary string as the separator: However, passing a string such as as the separator will rarely make a lot of sense. In practice, you’ll probably want to stick with passing a well-readable separator symbol like in the previous examples. To squish objects together without any space between them, you specify an empty string ( ) as the separator: Finally, you can add a linebreak in between each item by passing the newline character ( ) to : Separating objects with a newline character displays each of them on an individual line, which can be helpful when you need to inspect more complex objects. Sometimes, you may even want to separate them with two consecutive newline characters ( ) to group your output better and make it more readable. The keyword argument causes Python to terminate the output by instead of by the default newline: In this example, you’ve replaced the default newline end character with an exclamation mark. Notice how this breaks the usual neat way that calling drops you into a new empty line. Now you get to see an exclamation mark followed directly by Python’s input prompt ( ) because you told not to write a newline character. You can also pass an empty string to this parameter to side-step the default newline functionality. For example, assume that you’re displaying values in a loop: For such small values, you might want to display all values on one line, rather than on individual lines. You can accomplish this with : Note that your prompt slid back up into the output line again because you’re not using a newline as the output terminator. By calling without any arguments just after the loop, you can avoid that, too: When you don’t provide any values to , it outputs a newline character, effectively moving the cursor to the next line. Alternatively, you can achieve the same effect with a bit of logic wrapped in a conditional expression: Just like with , you can use any string as an argument to the keyword, but some strings will make more sense than others as output terminators. The function accepts two additional keyword arguments, and , both of which affect how the function handles the output stream. If you want to learn how to work with these two additional keyword arguments, then you can read the in-depth guide about Python’s function."

With the print() function, we can display output in various formats, while the input() function enables interaction with users by gathering input during program execution.\n\nPython input() function is used to take user input. By default, it returns the user input in form of a string.\n\nThe code prompts the user to input their name, stores it in the variable “name” and then prints a greeting message addressing the user by their entered name.\n\nAt its core, printing output in Python is straightforward, thanks to the print() function. This function allows us to display text, variables and expressions on the console. Let’s begin with the basic usage of the print() function:\n\nIn this example, “Hello, World!” is a string literal enclosed within double quotes. When executed, this statement will output the text to the console.\n\nWe can use the print() function to print single and multiple variables. We can print multiple variables by separating them with commas. Example:\n\nWe are taking multiple input from the user in a single line, splitting the values entered by the user into separate variables for each value using the split() method. Then, it prints the values with corresponding labels, either two or three, based on the number of inputs provided by the user.\n\nTake Conditional Input from user in Python\n\nIn this example, the program prompts the user to enter their age. The input is converted to an integer using the int() function. Then, the program uses conditional statements to check the age range and prints a message based on whether the user is a minor, an adult, or a senior citizen.\n\nHow to Change the Type of Input in Python\n\nBy default input() function helps in taking user input as string. If any user wants to take input as int or float, we just need to typecast it.\n\nThe code prompts the user to input a string (the color of a rose), assigns it to the variable color and then prints the inputted color.\n\nThe code prompts the user to input an integer representing the number of roses, converts the input to an integer using typecasting and then prints the integer value.\n\nThe code prompts the user to input the price of each rose as a floating-point number, converts the input to a float using typecasting and then prints the price.\n\nIn the given example, we are printing the type of variable x. We will determine the type of an object in Python.\n\nOutput formatting in Python with various techniques including the format() method, manipulation of the sep and end parameters, f-strings and the versatile % operator.

        "document": "Python list slicing is fundamental concept that let us easily access specific elements in a list. In this article, we’ll learn the syntax and how to use both positive and negative indexing for slicing with examples.\n\nExample: Get the items from a list starting at position 1 and ending at position 4 (exclusive).\n• start (optional): Index to begin the slice (inclusive). Defaults to 0 if omitted.\n• end (optional): Index to end the slice (exclusive). Defaults to the length of list if omitted.\n• step (optional): Step size, specifying the interval between elements. Defaults to 1 if omitted\n\nLet’s see how to use list slicing in Python with the examples below.\n\nGet all the items from a list\n\nTo retrieve all items from a list, we can use slicing without specifying any parameters.\n\nExplanation: Using [:] & [::] without specifying any start, end, or step returns all elements of the list.\n\nTo get all the items from a specific position to the end of the list, we can specify the start index and leave the end blank.\n\nAnd to get all the items before a specific index, we can specify the end index while leaving start blank.\n\nGet all items between two positions\n\nTo extract elements between two specific positions, specify both the start and end indices\n\nGet items at specified intervals\n\nTo extract elements at specific intervals, use the step parameter.\n\nIn Python, list slicing allows out-of-bound indexing without raising errors. If we specify indices beyond the list length then it will simply return the available items.\n\nExample: The slice a[7:15] starts at index 7 and attempts to reach index 15, but since the list ends at index 8, so it will return only the available elements (i.e. [8,9]).\n\nNegative indexing is useful for accessing elements from the end of the list. The last element has an index of -1, the second last element -2, and so on.\n\nThis example shows how to use negative numbers to access elements from the list starting from the end. Negative indexing makes it easy to get items without needing to know the exact length of the list.\n\nIn this example, we’ll reverse the entire list using a slicing trick. By using a negative step value, we can move through the list in reverse order.\n\nExplanation: The negative step (-1) indicates that Python should traverse the list in reverse order, starting from the end. The slice a[::-1] starts from the end of the list and moves to the beginning which result in reversing list. It’s a quick and easy way to get the list in reverse without changing the original list."

        "document": "Python lists can store an ordered collection of items, or elements, of varying types. They are often used to compile multiple items into a single, mutable variable, which is helpful for retrieving items, specifying outputs or performing calculations quickly. Lists are also a type of built-in data structure in Python (along with tuples, sets and dictionaries), which is a specified way of storing and formatting data.\n\nIf you’re curious about using lists in Python, here’s how to create one and modify them in different ways.\n\nHow to Create a List in Python\n\nTo create a list in Python, write a set of items within square brackets ([]) and separate each item with a comma. Items in a list can be any basic object type found in Python, including integers, strings, floating point values or boolean values.\n\nFor example, to create a list named “z” that holds the integers 3, 7, 4 and 2, you would write:\n\nThe “z” list defined above has items that are all of the same type (integer or int), but as mentioned, all the items in a list do not need to be of the same type as you can see below.\n\nThis list contains an integer (int), a bool, a string and a float.\n\nAll Python lists include the following features or characteristics:\n• Lists can contain items of different types at the same time (including strings, integers, floating point numbers and boolean values).\n• Lists are mutable and dynamic; list items can be added, removed or changed after the list is defined.\n• Lists are ordered; newly added items will be placed at the end of the list.\n• Lists use zero-based indexing; every list item has an associated index, and the first item’s index is 0.\n• Lists can be nested within other lists indefinitely.\n\nHow to Access Values in a Python List\n\nEach item in a list has an assigned index value. It’s important to note that Python is a zero-indexed based language. All this means is that the first item in the list starts at index 0 and ascends accordingly. In the example list, “z,” the indices of each list item would look like this:\n\nTo access an item value, print the index of the associated item in the list. As an example, say you wanted to access the first item from the list “z,” shown in blue below:\n\nTo access this item, you would use the item’s index, 0, and write:\n\nPython also supports negative indexing. Negative indexing starts at the end. It can be more convenient at times to use negative indexing to get the last item in the list because you don’t have to know the length of the list to access the last item.\n\nAs a reminder, you could also access the same item using positive indexes, as seen below.\n\nSlices are good for getting a subset of values in your list. For the example code below, it will return a list with the items from index 0 up to and not including index 2.\n\nThe code below returns a list with items from index 1 to the end of the list\n\nHow to Update an Item in a Python List\n\nLists in Python are mutable. After defining a list, it’s possible to update the individual items in a list.\n\nPython lists have different methods that help you modify a list. This section of the tutorial just goes over various python list methods.\n\nThe index method returns the first index at which a value occurs. Say you want to get the index of the first occurrence of “4” in this list:\n\nIn the code below, using index() will return 0.\n\nYou can also specify where you want to start your search if there are multiple of the same list item.\n\nJust like how it sounds, the count method counts the number of times a value occurs in a list\n\nThe sort method sorts and alters the original list in place.\n\nThe code above sorts a list from low to high. The code below shows that you can also sort a list from high to low.\n\nAs an aside, I should mention that you can also sort a list of strings from “a-z” and “z-a”.\n\nMore on Sorting in Python: 4 Python Tools to Simplify Your Life\n\nThe append method adds an element to the end of a list. This happens in place.\n\nThe remove method removes the first occurrence of a value in a list.\n\nCode removes the first occurrence of the value 2 from the list z.\n\nThe pop method removes an item at the index you provide. This method will also return the item you removed from the list. If you don’t provide an index, it will default to removing the item at the last index.\n\nThis method extends a list by appending items. The benefit of this is you can add lists together.\n\nAlternatively, the same thing could be accomplished by using the operator.\n\nThe insert method inserts an item before the index you provide."

        "document": "Imagine having a long loaf of bread. Sometimes, you want the whole thing, but other times you only need a few slices. List slicing in Python works in a similar way—it lets you extract specific portions of a list rather than working with the entire list at once. This is incredibly useful when dealing with large datasets, manipulating specific ranges of data, or simply extracting the information you need.\n\nTo perform slicing, you use square brackets along with a special syntax. This syntax involves specifying the starting index (where your slice begins), the stopping index (where it ends), and the step size (how many elements you skip between each included element). With this simple technique, you can access elements from the beginning, middle, or end of a list, modify, remove, or insert elements in a list, and even create copies of entire lists.\n\nThroughout this tutorial, we’ll learn how this syntax works and explore examples of different slicing techniques. Let’s get started!\n\nThe basic syntax for slicing a list is:\n• : The index at which the slice begins (inclusive). If omitted, the slice starts from the beginning of the list.\n• : The index at which the slice ends (exclusive). If omitted, the slice goes up to the end of the list.\n• : The interval between elements in the slice. If omitted, the default step is 1.\n\nSo, if you have a list named L, writing gives you a new list containing the elements from L starting at the index, going up to (but not including) the index, and taking elements in steps of .\n\nLet’s look at a simple example of list slicing. Imagine you have a list of letters named L:\n\nNow, let’s say you want to extract a portion of this list, specifically the elements from ‘c’ to ‘g’. You can do this using slicing:\n\nIn this example, we start at index 2, which corresponds to the letter ‘c’. Then we slice up to, but not including, index 7. This means we stop just before the letter ‘h’ at index 7. The result is a new list that contains the elements at indices 2 through 6, giving us the desired sequence of letters from ‘c’ to ‘g’.\n\nWhen slicing lists in Python, you can use negative indices as well. This allows you to reference elements from the end of the list. For example, the index -1 represents the last element, -2 represents the second-to-last element, and so on.\n\nConsider the same list of letters. If you wanted to extract the elements from ‘c’ to ‘g’ using negative indices, you could write:\n\nPython allows you to mix positive and negative indices within the same slice. This can be particularly useful when you want to select elements relative to both the beginning and the end of your list.\n\nIn addition to specifying and indices, slicing also allows you to introduce a value, enabling you to extract elements at regular intervals.\n\nLet’s take our familiar list of letters as an example. If you want to get every other element starting from index 2 (the letter ‘c’) and going up to, but not including, index 7, you can use a value of 2:\n\nA negative reverses the order of elements. In the example below, the slice starts at index 6 and ends before index 1, taking every second element in reverse order.\n\nWhen using a negative , ensure the index is greater than the index.\n\nSlice at the Beginning and to the End\n\nWhen you omit the index, the slice begins at the start of the list. So, is equivalent to .\n\nFor example, to get the first three items of a list named L, you would use .\n\nOn the other hand, when you omit the index, the slice goes up to the end of the list. So, is equivalent to .\n\nFor example, to obtain the last three items, you’d use .\n\nOmitting both the and indices while specifying a negative value of -1 reverses the order of elements in the slice.\n\nSlicing can also be used to modify lists. You can replace elements within a list by assigning a new list to a slice of the original list.\n\nFor example, if you want to replace the elements from index 1 to 3 (inclusive) with the values 1, 2, and 3, you can do:\n\nInterestingly, you can replace a single element with multiple elements using this technique.\n\nYou can efficiently insert new elements into a list without replacing existing ones by specifying a zero-length slice.\n\nTo insert elements at the beginning of a list, you can use a slice starting from the beginning ( ) and assign the new elements to it.\n\nIf you want to insert elements at the end, you can use a slice that starts at the current length of the list ( ) and assign the new elements there.\n\nInserting in the middle of the list is also possible. By using a slice with the same and index, you can insert elements at the desired position within the list without overwriting any existing elements.\n\nYou can remove multiple elements from the middle of a list using slicing techniques. One way to do this is by assigning an empty list to the desired slice.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the statement to achieve the same result.\n\nIn Python, when you assign one list to another (e.g., ), you’re not creating a true copy. Instead, you’re creating a new reference that points to the same underlying list object. Any changes made to either or will affect both, as they share the same data.\n\nTo create an actual copy of the list, you can use the slicing operator. By omitting both the and indices ( ), you create a copy of the entire list L1. This means L2 is a new list object containing the same elements as L1, but changes to one list won’t affect the other.\n\nIt’s important to note that this slicing technique creates a shallow copy. This means a new list is made, but if the original list contains mutable objects (like nested lists or dictionaries), those objects are not duplicated. Both lists share references to the same mutable objects.\n\nFor deeper copies where nested mutable objects are also duplicated, you can use the method or the function (if you need to copy nested objects recursively).\n\nIn list slicing, certain considerations are important to avoid unexpected behavior.\n\nWhen you use indices that go beyond the boundaries of a list, Python adjusts the indices to the nearest valid values instead of causing an error. For example:\n\nHere, starts at index 3 and attempts to go up to index 100. Since the list ends before index 100, the slice includes all elements from index 3 to the end.\n\nIf you try to create a slice where the starting index is the same as or greater than the stopping index (and the is positive), you’ll get an empty list:\n\nSpecifying a size of 0 is not allowed and will result in a :"
