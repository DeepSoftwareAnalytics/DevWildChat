        "document": "This chapter describes some things you’ve learned about already in more detail, and adds some new things as well.\n\nThe list data type has some more methods. Here are all of the methods of list objects: Add an item to the end of the list. Similar to . Extend the list by appending all the items from the iterable. Similar to . Insert an item at a given position. The first argument is the index of the element before which to insert, so inserts at the front of the list, and is equivalent to . Remove the first item from the list whose value is equal to x. It raises a if there is no such item. Remove the item at the given position in the list, and return it. If no index is specified, removes and returns the last item in the list. It raises an if the list is empty or the index is outside the list range. Remove all items from the list. Similar to . Return zero-based index in the list of the first item whose value is equal to x. Raises a if there is no such item. The optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in the slice notation and are used to limit the search to a particular subsequence of the list. The returned index is computed relative to the beginning of the full sequence rather than the start argument. Return the number of times x appears in the list. Sort the items of the list in place (the arguments can be used for sort customization, see for their explanation). Reverse the elements of the list in place. Return a shallow copy of the list. Similar to . An example that uses most of the list methods: You might have noticed that methods like , or that only modify the list have no return value printed – they return the default . This is a design principle for all mutable data structures in Python. Another thing you might notice is that not all data can be sorted or compared. For instance, doesn’t sort because integers can’t be compared to strings and can’t be compared to other types. Also, there are some types that don’t have a defined ordering relation. For example, isn’t a valid comparison. The list methods make it very easy to use a list as a stack, where the last element added is the first element retrieved (“last-in, first-out”). To add an item to the top of the stack, use . To retrieve an item from the top of the stack, use without an explicit index. For example: It is also possible to use a list as a queue, where the first element added is the first element retrieved (“first-in, first-out”); however, lists are not efficient for this purpose. While appends and pops from the end of list are fast, doing inserts or pops from the beginning of a list is slow (because all of the other elements have to be shifted by one). To implement a queue, use which was designed to have fast appends and pops from both ends. For example: # The first to arrive now leaves # The second to arrive now leaves List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. Common applications are to make new lists where each element is the result of some operations applied to each member of another sequence or iterable, or to create a subsequence of those elements that satisfy a certain condition. For example, assume we want to create a list of squares, like: Note that this creates (or overwrites) a variable named that still exists after the loop completes. We can calculate the list of squares without any side effects using: which is more concise and readable. A list comprehension consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a clause, then zero or more or clauses. The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the context of the and clauses which follow it. For example, this listcomp combines the elements of two lists if they are not equal: Note how the order of the and statements is the same in both these snippets. If the expression is a tuple (e.g. the in the previous example), it must be parenthesized. # create a new list with the values doubled # apply a function to all the elements # the tuple must be parenthesized, otherwise an error is raised File , line : did you forget parentheses around the comprehension target? # flatten a list using a listcomp with two 'for' List comprehensions can contain complex expressions and nested functions: The initial expression in a list comprehension can be any arbitrary expression, including another list comprehension. Consider the following example of a 3x4 matrix implemented as a list of 3 lists of length 4: The following list comprehension will transpose rows and columns: As we saw in the previous section, the inner list comprehension is evaluated in the context of the that follows it, so this example is equivalent to: which, in turn, is the same as: # the following 3 lines implement the nested listcomp In the real world, you should prefer built-in functions to complex flow statements. The function would do a great job for this use case: See Unpacking Argument Lists for details on the asterisk in this line.\n\nWe saw that lists and strings have many common properties, such as indexing and slicing operations. They are two examples of sequence data types (see Sequence Types — list, tuple, range). Since Python is an evolving language, other sequence data types may be added. There is also another standard sequence data type: the tuple. A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas, for instance: File , line , in : # but they can contain mutable objects: As you see, on output tuples are always enclosed in parentheses, so that nested tuples are interpreted correctly; they may be input with or without surrounding parentheses, although often parentheses are necessary anyway (if the tuple is part of a larger expression). It is not possible to assign to the individual items of a tuple, however it is possible to create tuples which contain mutable objects, such as lists. Though tuples may seem similar to lists, they are often used in different situations and for different purposes. Tuples are immutable, and usually contain a heterogeneous sequence of elements that are accessed via unpacking (see later in this section) or indexing (or even by attribute in the case of ). Lists are mutable, and their elements are usually homogeneous and are accessed by iterating over the list. A special problem is the construction of tuples containing 0 or 1 items: the syntax has some extra quirks to accommodate these. Empty tuples are constructed by an empty pair of parentheses; a tuple with one item is constructed by following a value with a comma (it is not sufficient to enclose a single value in parentheses). Ugly, but effective. For example: The statement is an example of tuple packing: the values , and are packed together in a tuple. The reverse operation is also possible: This is called, appropriately enough, sequence unpacking and works for any sequence on the right-hand side. Sequence unpacking requires that there are as many variables on the left side of the equals sign as there are elements in the sequence. Note that multiple assignment is really just a combination of tuple packing and sequence unpacking.\n\nPython also includes a data type for sets. A set is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements. Basic uses include membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries. Set objects also support mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference. Curly braces or the function can be used to create sets. Note: to create an empty set you have to use , not ; the latter creates an empty dictionary, a data structure that we discuss in the next section. Here is a brief demonstration: # show that duplicates have been removed # Demonstrate set operations on unique letters from two words # letters in a but not in b # letters in a or b or both # letters in both a and b # letters in a or b but not both Similarly to list comprehensions, set comprehensions are also supported:\n\nAnother useful data type built into Python is the dictionary (see Mapping Types — dict). Dictionaries are sometimes found in other languages as “associative memories” or “associative arrays”. Unlike sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys, which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys. Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key. You can’t use lists as keys, since lists can be modified in place using index assignments, slice assignments, or methods like and . It is best to think of a dictionary as a set of key: value pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary). A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary: . Placing a comma-separated list of key:value pairs within the braces adds initial key:value pairs to the dictionary; this is also the way dictionaries are written on output. The main operations on a dictionary are storing a value with some key and extracting the value given the key. It is also possible to delete a key:value pair with . If you store using a key that is already in use, the old value associated with that key is forgotten. It is an error to extract a value using a non-existent key. Performing on a dictionary returns a list of all the keys used in the dictionary, in insertion order (if you want it sorted, just use instead). To check whether a single key is in the dictionary, use the keyword. Here is a small example using a dictionary: The constructor builds dictionaries directly from sequences of key-value pairs: In addition, dict comprehensions can be used to create dictionaries from arbitrary key and value expressions: When the keys are simple strings, it is sometimes easier to specify pairs using keyword arguments:\n\nWhen looping through dictionaries, the key and corresponding value can be retrieved at the same time using the method. When looping through a sequence, the position index and corresponding value can be retrieved at the same time using the function. To loop over two or more sequences at the same time, the entries can be paired with the function. What is your name? It is lancelot. What is your quest? It is the holy grail. What is your favorite color? It is blue. To loop over a sequence in reverse, first specify the sequence in a forward direction and then call the function. To loop over a sequence in sorted order, use the function which returns a new sorted list while leaving the source unaltered. Using on a sequence eliminates duplicate elements. The use of in combination with over a sequence is an idiomatic way to loop over unique elements of the sequence in sorted order. It is sometimes tempting to change a list while you are looping over it; however, it is often simpler and safer to create a new list instead.\n\nThe conditions used in and statements can contain any operators, not just comparisons. The comparison operators and are membership tests that determine whether a value is in (or not in) a container. The operators and compare whether two objects are really the same object. All comparison operators have the same priority, which is lower than that of all numerical operators. Comparisons can be chained. For example, tests whether is less than and moreover equals . Comparisons may be combined using the Boolean operators and , and the outcome of a comparison (or of any other Boolean expression) may be negated with . These have lower priorities than comparison operators; between them, has the highest priority and the lowest, so that A and not B or C is equivalent to (A and (not B)) or C . As always, parentheses can be used to express the desired composition. The Boolean operators and are so-called short-circuit operators: their arguments are evaluated from left to right, and evaluation stops as soon as the outcome is determined. For example, if and are true but is false, A and B and C does not evaluate the expression . When used as a general value and not as a Boolean, the return value of a short-circuit operator is the last evaluated argument. It is possible to assign the result of a comparison or other Boolean expression to a variable. For example, Note that in Python, unlike C, assignment inside expressions must be done explicitly with the walrus operator . This avoids a common class of problems encountered in C programs: typing in an expression when was intended.\n\nSequence objects typically may be compared to other objects with the same sequence type. The comparison uses lexicographical ordering: first the first two items are compared, and if they differ this determines the outcome of the comparison; if they are equal, the next two items are compared, and so on, until either sequence is exhausted. If two items to be compared are themselves sequences of the same type, the lexicographical comparison is carried out recursively. If all items of two sequences compare equal, the sequences are considered equal. If one sequence is an initial sub-sequence of the other, the shorter sequence is the smaller (lesser) one. Lexicographical ordering for strings uses the Unicode code point number to order individual characters. Some examples of comparisons between sequences of the same type: Note that comparing objects of different types with or is legal provided that the objects have appropriate comparison methods. For example, mixed numeric types are compared according to their numeric value, so 0 equals 0.0, etc. Otherwise, rather than providing an arbitrary ordering, the interpreter will raise a exception."

Return the number of times x appears in the list. Sort the items of the list in place (the arguments can be used for sort customization, see for their explanation).

This differs from the method which returns a value. The statement can also be used to remove slices from a list or clear the entire list (which we did earlier by assignment of an empty list to the slice). For example: can also be used to delete entire variables: Referencing the name hereafter is an error (at least until another value is assigned to it). We’ll find other uses for later.\n\nWe saw that lists and strings have many common properties, such as indexing and slicing operations.

The outcome is deterministic but arbitrary: the types are ordered by their name. Thus, a list is always smaller than a string, a string is always smaller than a tuple, etc. Mixed numeric types are compared according to their numeric value, so 0 equals 0.0, etc."

        "document": "List comprehension is a way to create lists using a concise syntax. It allows us to generate a new list by applying an expression to each item in an existing iterable (such as a list or range). This helps us to write cleaner, more readable code compared to traditional looping techniques.\n\nFor example, if we have a list of integers and want to create a new list containing the square of each element, we can easily achieve this using list comprehension.\n• expression: The transformation or value to be included in the new list.\n• item: The current element taken from the iterable.\n• if condition (optional): A filtering condition that decides whether the current item should be included.\n\nThis syntax allows us to combine iteration, modification, and conditional filtering all in one line.\n\nThe main difference is that a for loop requires multiple lines to create a new list by iterating over items and manually adding each one. Whereas, list comprehension do the same task in a single line, this makes the code simpler and easier to read.\n\nExample: Let’s take an example, where we want to double each number of given list into a new list\n\nExplanation: Create an empty list ‘res‘ to store results and iterate over each element in list ‘a‘ and for each items in list ‘a‘, multiply it by 2 and append it to ‘res‘ using append() method.\n\nExplanation: In the above list comprehension, the iterable is a list ‘a’, and the expression is val * 2, which multiplies each value from the list by 2.\n\nList comprehensions can include conditional statements to filter or modify items based on specific criteria. These conditionals help us create customized lists quickly and making the code cleaner and more efficient.\n\nExample: Suppose we want to filter all even list from the given list.\n\nTo learn more about filtering conditions in list comprehensions, please refer to “Python List Comprehension Using If-Else“\n\nA simple example is creating a list of numbers from 0 to 9.\n\nList comprehension can also be used with nested loops. Here, we generate a list of coordinate pairs for a simple 3×3 grid.\n\nSuppose we have a list of lists and we want to convert it into a single list.\n\nExplanation: The line [val for row in mat for val in row] uses nested list comprehension to iterate through each row in mat. For each row, it iterates through each val in that row and collecting all values into a single list."

The method is provided so that subclasses can override it.\n\nImplement checking for unused arguments if desired. The arguments to this function is the set of all argument keys that were actually referred to in the format string (integers for positional arguments, and strings for named arguments), and a reference to the args and kwargs that was passed to vformat. The set of unused args can be calculated from these parameters. check_unused_args() is assumed to raise an exception if the check fails.\n\nIf the index or keyword refers to an item that does not exist, then an IndexError or KeyError should be raised.\n\nSo for example, the field expression ‘0.name’ would cause get_value() to be called with a key argument of 0.

This is used by vformat() to break the string into either literal text, or replacement fields.\n\nIn addition, the Formatter defines a number of methods that are intended to be replaced by subclasses:\n\nThis function does the actual work of formatting. It is exposed as a separate function for cases where you want to pass in a predefined dictionary of arguments, rather than unpacking and repacking the dictionary as individual arguments using the *args and **kwargs syntax. vformat() does the work of breaking up the format string into character data and replacement fields. It calls the various methods described below.\n\nThe primary API method. It takes a format string and an arbitrary set of positional and keyword arguments. It is just a wrapper that calls vformat() .\n\nThe built-in string class provides the ability to do complex variable substitutions and value formatting via the format() method described in PEP 3101 . The Formatter class in the string module allows you to create and customize your own string formatting behaviors using the same implementation as the built-in format() method.\n\nThe method and the class share the same syntax for format strings (although in the case of , subclasses can define their own format string syntax). The syntax is related to that of formatted string literals, but it is less sophisticated and, in particular, does not support arbitrary expressions.\n\nFormat strings contain “replacement fields” surrounded by curly braces . Anything that is not contained in braces is considered literal text, which is copied unchanged to the output. If you need to include a brace character in the literal text, it can be escaped by doubling: and .\n\nThe grammar for a replacement field is as follows:\n\nIn less formal terms, the replacement field can start with a field_name that specifies the object whose value is to be formatted and inserted into the output instead of the replacement field. The field_name is optionally followed by a conversion field, which is preceded by an exclamation point , and a format_spec, which is preceded by a colon . These specify a non-default format for the replacement value.\n\nSee also the Format Specification Mini-Language section.\n\nThe field_name itself begins with an arg_name that is either a number or a keyword. If it’s a number, it refers to a positional argument, and if it’s a keyword, it refers to a named keyword argument. An arg_name is treated as a number if a call to on the string would return true. If the numerical arg_names in a format string are 0, 1, 2, … in sequence, they can all be omitted (not just some) and the numbers 0, 1, 2, … will be automatically inserted in that order. Because arg_name is not quote-delimited, it is not possible to specify arbitrary dictionary keys (e.g., the strings or ) within a format string. The arg_name can be followed by any number of index or attribute expressions. An expression of the form selects the named attribute using , while an expression of the form does an index lookup using .\n\nThe conversion field causes a type coercion before formatting. Normally, the job of formatting a value is done by the method of the value itself. However, in some cases it is desirable to force a type to be formatted as a string, overriding its own definition of formatting. By converting the value to a string before calling , the normal formatting logic is bypassed.\n\nThree conversion flags are currently supported: which calls on the value, which calls and which calls .\n\nThe format_spec field contains a specification of how the value should be presented, including such details as field width, alignment, padding, decimal precision and so on. Each value type can define its own “formatting mini-language” or interpretation of the format_spec.\n\nMost built-in types support a common formatting mini-language, which is described in the next section.\n\nA format_spec field can also include nested replacement fields within it. These nested replacement fields may contain a field name, conversion flag and format specification, but deeper nesting is not allowed. The replacement fields within the format_spec are substituted before the format_spec string is interpreted. This allows the formatting of a value to be dynamically specified.\n\nSee the Format examples section for some examples.\n\n“Format specifications” are used within replacement fields contained within a format string to define how individual values are presented (see Format String Syntax and f-strings). They can also be passed directly to the built-in function. Each formattable type may define how the format specification is to be interpreted. Most built-in types implement the following options for format specifications, although some of the formatting options are only supported by the numeric types. A general convention is that an empty format specification produces the same result as if you had called on the value. A non-empty format specification typically modifies the result. The general form of a standard format specifier is: If a valid align value is specified, it can be preceded by a fill character that can be any character and defaults to a space if omitted. It is not possible to use a literal curly brace (” ” or “ ”) as the fill character in a formatted string literal or when using the method. However, it is possible to insert a curly brace with a nested replacement field. This limitation doesn’t affect the function. The meaning of the various alignment options is as follows: Forces the field to be left-aligned within the available space (this is the default for most objects). Forces the field to be right-aligned within the available space (this is the default for numbers). Forces the padding to be placed after the sign (if any) but before the digits. This is used for printing fields in the form ‘+000000120’. This alignment option is only valid for numeric types, excluding . It becomes the default for numbers when ‘0’ immediately precedes the field width. Forces the field to be centered within the available space. Note that unless a minimum field width is defined, the field width will always be the same size as the data to fill it, so that the alignment option has no meaning in this case. The sign option is only valid for number types, and can be one of the following: indicates that a sign should be used for both positive as well as negative numbers. indicates that a sign should be used only for negative numbers (this is the default behavior). indicates that a leading space should be used on positive numbers, and a minus sign on negative numbers. The option coerces negative zero floating-point values to positive zero after rounding to the format precision. This option is only valid for floating-point presentation types. Changed in version 3.11: Added the option (see also PEP 682). The option causes the “alternate form” to be used for the conversion. The alternate form is defined differently for different types. This option is only valid for integer, float and complex types. For integers, when binary, octal, or hexadecimal output is used, this option adds the respective prefix , , , or to the output value. For float and complex the alternate form causes the result of the conversion to always contain a decimal-point character, even if no digits follow it. Normally, a decimal-point character appears in the result of these conversions only if a digit follows it. In addition, for and conversions, trailing zeros are not removed from the result. The option signals the use of a comma for a thousands separator for floating-point presentation types and for integer presentation type . For other presentation types, this option is an error. For a locale aware separator, use the integer presentation type instead. Changed in version 3.1: Added the option (see also PEP 378). The option signals the use of an underscore for a thousands separator for floating-point presentation types and for integer presentation type . For integer presentation types , , , and , underscores will be inserted every 4 digits. For other presentation types, specifying this option is an error. Changed in version 3.6: Added the option (see also PEP 515). width is a decimal integer defining the minimum total field width, including any prefixes, separators, and other formatting characters. If not specified, then the field width will be determined by the content. When no explicit alignment is given, preceding the width field by a zero ( ) character enables sign-aware zero-padding for numeric types, excluding . This is equivalent to a fill character of with an alignment type of . Changed in version 3.10: Preceding the width field by no longer affects the default alignment for strings. The precision is a decimal integer indicating how many digits should be displayed after the decimal point for presentation types and , or before and after the decimal point for presentation types or . For string presentation types the field indicates the maximum field size - in other words, how many characters will be used from the field content. The precision is not allowed for integer presentation types. Finally, the type determines how the data should be presented. The available string presentation types are: String format. This is the default type for strings and may be omitted. The available integer presentation types are: Character. Converts the integer to the corresponding unicode character before printing. Hex format. Outputs the number in base 16, using lower-case letters for the digits above 9. Hex format. Outputs the number in base 16, using upper-case letters for the digits above 9. In case is specified, the prefix will be upper-cased to as well. Number. This is the same as , except that it uses the current locale setting to insert the appropriate number separator characters. In addition to the above presentation types, integers can be formatted with the floating-point presentation types listed below (except and ). When doing so, is used to convert the integer to a floating-point number before formatting. The available presentation types for and values are: Scientific notation. For a given precision , formats the number in scientific notation with the letter ‘e’ separating the coefficient from the exponent. The coefficient has one digit before and digits after the decimal point, for a total of significant digits. With no precision given, uses a precision of digits after the decimal point for , and shows all coefficient digits for . If , the decimal point is omitted unless the option is used. Scientific notation. Same as except it uses an upper case ‘E’ as the separator character. Fixed-point notation. For a given precision , formats the number as a decimal number with exactly digits following the decimal point. With no precision given, uses a precision of digits after the decimal point for , and uses a precision large enough to show all coefficient digits for . If , the decimal point is omitted unless the option is used. Fixed-point notation. Same as , but converts to and to . General format. For a given precision , this rounds the number to significant digits and then formats the result in either fixed-point format or in scientific notation, depending on its magnitude. A precision of is treated as equivalent to a precision of . The precise rules are as follows: suppose that the result formatted with presentation type and precision would have exponent . Then, if , where is -4 for floats and -6 for , the number is formatted with presentation type and precision . Otherwise, the number is formatted with presentation type and precision . In both cases insignificant trailing zeros are removed from the significand, and the decimal point is also removed if there are no remaining digits following it, unless the option is used. With no precision given, uses a precision of significant digits for . For , the coefficient of the result is formed from the coefficient digits of the value; scientific notation is used for values smaller than in absolute value and values where the place value of the least significant digit is larger than 1, and fixed-point notation is used otherwise. Positive and negative infinity, positive and negative zero, and nans, are formatted as , , , and respectively, regardless of the precision. General format. Same as except switches to if the number gets too large. The representations of infinity and NaN are uppercased, too. Number. This is the same as , except that it uses the current locale setting to insert the appropriate number separator characters. Percentage. Multiplies the number by 100 and displays in fixed ( ) format, followed by a percent sign. For this is like the type, except that when fixed-point notation is used to format the result, it always includes at least one digit past the decimal point, and switches to the scientific notation when . When the precision is not specified, the latter will be as large as needed to represent the given value faithfully. For , this is the same as either or depending on the value of for the current decimal context. The overall effect is to match the output of as altered by the other format modifiers. The result should be correctly rounded to a given precision of digits after the decimal point. The rounding mode for matches that of the builtin. For , the rounding mode of the current context will be used. The available presentation types for are the same as those for ( is not allowed). Both the real and imaginary components of a complex number are formatted as floating-point numbers, according to the specified presentation type. They are separated by the mandatory sign of the imaginary part, the latter being terminated by a suffix. If the presentation type is missing, the result will match the output of (complex numbers with a non-zero real part are also surrounded by parentheses), possibly altered by other format modifiers.\n\nThis section contains examples of the syntax and comparison with the old -formatting. In most of the cases the syntax is similar to the old -formatting, with the addition of the and with used instead of . For example, can be translated to . The new format syntax also supports new and different options, shown in the following examples. is formed from the real part 'The complex number (3-5j) is formed from the real part 3.0 and the imaginary part -5.0.'

        "document": "The following sections describe the standard types that are built into the interpreter.\n\nThe principal built-in types are numerics, sequences, mappings, classes, instances and exceptions.\n\nSome collection classes are mutable. The methods that add, subtract, or rearrange their members in place, and don’t return a specific item, never return the collection instance itself but .\n\nSome operations are supported by several object types; in particular, practically all objects can be compared for equality, tested for truth value, and converted to a string (with the function or the slightly different function). The latter function is implicitly used when an object is written by the function.\n\nThere are three distinct numeric types: integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers. In addition, Booleans are a subtype of integers. Integers have unlimited precision. Floating-point numbers are usually implemented using double in C; information about the precision and internal representation of floating-point numbers for the machine on which your program is running is available in . Complex numbers have a real and imaginary part, which are each a floating-point number. To extract these parts from a complex number z, use and . (The standard library includes the additional numeric types , for rationals, and , for floating-point numbers with user-definable precision.) Numbers are created by numeric literals or as the result of built-in functions and operators. Unadorned integer literals (including hex, octal and binary numbers) yield integers. Numeric literals containing a decimal point or an exponent sign yield floating-point numbers. Appending or to a numeric literal yields an imaginary number (a complex number with a zero real part) which you can add to an integer or float to get a complex number with real and imaginary parts. Python fully supports mixed arithmetic: when a binary arithmetic operator has operands of different numeric types, the operand with the “narrower” type is widened to that of the other, where integer is narrower than floating point, which is narrower than complex. A comparison between numbers of different types behaves as though the exact values of those numbers were being compared. The constructors , , and can be used to produce numbers of a specific type. All numeric types (except complex) support the following operations (for priorities of the operations, see Operator precedence): absolute value or magnitude of x a complex number with real part re, imaginary part im. im defaults to zero. conjugate of the complex number c\n• None Also referred to as integer division. For operands of type , the result has type . For operands of type , the result has type . In general, the result is a whole integer, though the result’s type is not necessarily . The result is always rounded towards minus infinity: is , is , is , and is .\n• None Not for complex numbers. Instead convert to floats using if appropriate.\n• None Conversion from to truncates, discarding the fractional part. See functions and for alternative conversions.\n• None float also accepts the strings “nan” and “inf” with an optional prefix “+” or “-” for Not a Number (NaN) and positive or negative infinity.\n• None Python defines and to be , as is common for programming languages.\n• None The numeric literals accepted include the digits to or any Unicode equivalent (code points with the property). See the Unicode Standard for a complete list of code points with the property. All types ( and ) also include the following operations: x rounded to n digits, rounding half to even. If n is omitted, it defaults to 0. For additional numeric operations see the and modules. Bitwise operations only make sense for integers. The result of bitwise operations is calculated as though carried out in two’s complement with an infinite number of sign bits. The priorities of the binary bitwise operations are all lower than the numeric operations and higher than the comparisons; the unary operation has the same priority as the other unary numeric operations ( and ). This table lists the bitwise operations sorted in ascending priority: bitwise exclusive or of x and y\n• None Negative shift counts are illegal and cause a to be raised.\n• None A left shift by n bits is equivalent to multiplication by .\n• None A right shift by n bits is equivalent to floor division by .\n• None Performing these calculations with at least one extra sign extension bit in a finite two’s complement representation (a working bit-width of or more) is sufficient to get the same result as if there were an infinite number of sign bits. The int type implements the abstract base class. In addition, it provides a few more methods: Return the number of bits necessary to represent an integer in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros: More precisely, if is nonzero, then is the unique positive integer such that . Equivalently, when is small enough to have a correctly rounded logarithm, then . If is zero, then returns . Return the number of ones in the binary representation of the absolute value of the integer. This is also known as the population count. Example: Return an array of bytes representing an integer. The integer is represented using length bytes, and defaults to 1. An is raised if the integer is not representable with the given number of bytes. The byteorder argument determines the byte order used to represent the integer, and defaults to . If byteorder is , the most significant byte is at the beginning of the byte array. If byteorder is , the most significant byte is at the end of the byte array. The signed argument determines whether two’s complement is used to represent the integer. If signed is and a negative integer is given, an is raised. The default value for signed is . The default values can be used to conveniently turn an integer into a single byte object: However, when using the default arguments, don’t try to convert a value greater than 255 or you’ll get an . \"byteorder must be either 'little' or 'big'\" Changed in version 3.11: Added default argument values for and . Return the integer represented by the given array of bytes. The argument bytes must either be a bytes-like object or an iterable producing bytes. The byteorder argument determines the byte order used to represent the integer, and defaults to . If byteorder is , the most significant byte is at the beginning of the byte array. If byteorder is , the most significant byte is at the end of the byte array. To request the native byte order of the host system, use as the byte order value. The signed argument indicates whether two’s complement is used to represent the integer. \"byteorder must be either 'little' or 'big'\" Changed in version 3.11: Added default argument value for . Return a pair of integers whose ratio is equal to the original integer and has a positive denominator. The integer ratio of integers (whole numbers) is always the integer as the numerator and as the denominator. The float type implements the abstract base class. float also has the following additional methods. Return a pair of integers whose ratio is exactly equal to the original float. The ratio is in lowest terms and has a positive denominator. Raises on infinities and a on NaNs. Return if the float instance is finite with integral value, and otherwise: Two methods support conversion to and from hexadecimal strings. Since Python’s floats are stored internally as binary numbers, converting a float to or from a decimal string usually involves a small rounding error. In contrast, hexadecimal strings allow exact representation and specification of floating-point numbers. This can be useful when debugging, and in numerical work. Return a representation of a floating-point number as a hexadecimal string. For finite floating-point numbers, this representation will always include a leading and a trailing and exponent. Class method to return the float represented by a hexadecimal string s. The string s may have leading and trailing whitespace. Note that is an instance method, while is a class method. where the optional may by either or , and are strings of hexadecimal digits, and is a decimal integer with an optional leading sign. Case is not significant, and there must be at least one hexadecimal digit in either the integer or the fraction. This syntax is similar to the syntax specified in section 6.4.4.2 of the C99 standard, and also to the syntax used in Java 1.5 onwards. In particular, the output of is usable as a hexadecimal floating-point literal in C or Java code, and hexadecimal strings produced by C’s format character or Java’s are accepted by . Note that the exponent is written in decimal rather than hexadecimal, and that it gives the power of 2 by which to multiply the coefficient. For example, the hexadecimal string represents the floating-point number , or : Applying the reverse conversion to gives a different hexadecimal string representing the same number: For numbers and , possibly of different types, it’s a requirement that whenever (see the method documentation for more details). For ease of implementation and efficiency across a variety of numeric types (including , , and ) Python’s hash for numeric types is based on a single mathematical function that’s defined for any rational number, and hence applies to all instances of and , and all finite instances of and . Essentially, this function is given by reduction modulo for a fixed prime . The value of is made available to Python as the attribute of . CPython implementation detail: Currently, the prime used is on machines with 32-bit C longs and on machines with 64-bit C longs. Here are the rules in detail:\n• None If is a nonnegative rational number and is not divisible by , define as , where gives the inverse of modulo .\n• None If is a nonnegative rational number and is divisible by (but is not) then has no inverse modulo and the rule above doesn’t apply; in this case define to be the constant value .\n• None If is a negative rational number define as . If the resulting hash is , replace it with .\n• None The particular values and are used as hash values for positive infinity or negative infinity (respectively).\n• None For a number , the hash values of the real and imaginary parts are combined by computing , reduced modulo so that it lies in . Again, if the result is , it’s replaced with . To clarify the above rules, here’s some example Python code, equivalent to the built-in hash, for computing the hash of a rational number, , or : Assumes m and n are integers, with n positive. # Remove common factors of P. (Unnecessary if m and n already coprime.) # Fermat's Little Theorem: pow(n, P-1, P) is 1, so # pow(n, P-2, P) gives the inverse of n modulo P.\n\nThere are three basic sequence types: lists, tuples, and range objects. Additional sequence types tailored for processing of binary data and text strings are described in dedicated sections. The operations in the following table are supported by most sequence types, both mutable and immutable. The ABC is provided to make it easier to correctly implement these operations on custom sequence types. This table lists the sequence operations sorted in ascending priority. In the table, s and t are sequences of the same type, n, i, j and k are integers and x is an arbitrary object that meets any type and value restrictions imposed by s. The and operations have the same priorities as the comparison operations. The (concatenation) and (repetition) operations have the same priority as the corresponding numeric operations. if an item of s is equal to x, else if an item of s is equal to x, else the concatenation of s and t equivalent to adding s to itself n times slice of s from i to j with step k index of the first occurrence of x in s (at or after index i and before index j) total number of occurrences of x in s Sequences of the same type also support comparisons. In particular, tuples and lists are compared lexicographically by comparing corresponding elements. This means that to compare equal, every element must compare equal and the two sequences must be of the same type and have the same length. (For full details see Comparisons in the language reference.) Forward and reversed iterators over mutable sequences access values using an index. That index will continue to march forward (or backward) even if the underlying sequence is mutated. The iterator terminates only when an or a is encountered (or when the index drops below zero).\n• None While the and operations are used only for simple containment testing in the general case, some specialised sequences (such as , and ) also use them for subsequence testing:\n• None Values of n less than are treated as (which yields an empty sequence of the same type as s). Note that items in the sequence s are not copied; they are referenced multiple times. This often haunts new Python programmers; consider: What has happened is that is a one-element list containing an empty list, so all three elements of are references to this single empty list. Modifying any of the elements of modifies this single list. You can create a list of different lists this way: Further explanation is available in the FAQ entry How do I create a multidimensional list?.\n• None If i or j is negative, the index is relative to the end of sequence s: or is substituted. But note that is still .\n• None The slice of s from i to j is defined as the sequence of items with index k such that . If i or j is greater than , use . If i is omitted or , use . If j is omitted or , use . If i is greater than or equal to j, the slice is empty.\n• None The slice of s from i to j with step k is defined as the sequence of items with index such that . In other words, the indices are , , , and so on, stopping when j is reached (but never including j). When k is positive, i and j are reduced to if they are greater. When k is negative, i and j are reduced to if they are greater. If i or j are omitted or , they become “end” values (which end depends on the sign of k). Note, k cannot be zero. If k is , it is treated like .\n• None Concatenating immutable sequences always results in a new object. This means that building up a sequence by repeated concatenation will have a quadratic runtime cost in the total sequence length. To get a linear runtime cost, you must switch to one of the alternatives below:\n• None if concatenating objects, you can build a list and use at the end or else write to an instance and retrieve its value when complete\n• None if concatenating objects, you can similarly use or , or you can do in-place concatenation with a object. objects are mutable and have an efficient overallocation mechanism\n• None for other types, investigate the relevant class documentation\n• None Some sequence types (such as ) only support item sequences that follow specific patterns, and hence don’t support sequence concatenation or repetition.\n• None raises when x is not found in s. Not all implementations support passing the additional arguments i and j. These arguments allow efficient searching of subsections of the sequence. Passing the extra arguments is roughly equivalent to using , only without copying any data and with the returned index being relative to the start of the sequence rather than the start of the slice. The only operation that immutable sequence types generally implement that is not also implemented by mutable sequence types is support for the built-in. This support allows immutable sequences, such as instances, to be used as keys and stored in and instances. Attempting to hash an immutable sequence that contains unhashable values will result in . The operations in the following table are defined on mutable sequence types. The ABC is provided to make it easier to correctly implement these operations on custom sequence types. In the table s is an instance of a mutable sequence type, t is any iterable object and x is an arbitrary object that meets any type and value restrictions imposed by s (for example, only accepts integers that meet the value restriction ). item i of s is replaced by x slice of s from i to j is replaced by the contents of the iterable t the elements of are replaced by those of t removes the elements of from the list appends x to the end of the sequence (same as ) removes all items from s (same as ) creates a shallow copy of s (same as ) extends s with the contents of t (for the most part the same as ) inserts x into s at the index given by i (same as ) retrieves the item at i and also removes it from s removes the first item from s where is equal to x reverses the items of s in place\n• None If k is not equal to , t must have the same length as the slice it is replacing.\n• None The optional argument i defaults to , so that by default the last item is removed and returned.\n• None raises when x is not found in s.\n• None The method modifies the sequence in place for economy of space when reversing a large sequence. To remind users that it operates by side effect, it does not return the reversed sequence.\n• None and are included for consistency with the interfaces of mutable containers that don’t support slicing operations (such as and ). is not part of the ABC, but most concrete mutable sequence classes provide it.\n• None The value n is an integer, or an object implementing . Zero and negative values of n clear the sequence. Items in the sequence are not copied; they are referenced multiple times, as explained for under Common Sequence Operations. Lists are mutable sequences, typically used to store collections of homogeneous items (where the precise degree of similarity will vary by application). Lists may be constructed in several ways:\n• None Using a pair of square brackets to denote the empty list:\n• None Using the type constructor: or The constructor builds a list whose items are the same and in the same order as iterable’s items. iterable may be either a sequence, a container that supports iteration, or an iterator object. If iterable is already a list, a copy is made and returned, similar to . For example, returns and returns . If no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty list, . Many other operations also produce lists, including the built-in. Lists implement all of the common and mutable sequence operations. Lists also provide the following additional method: This method sorts the list in place, using only comparisons between items. Exceptions are not suppressed - if any comparison operations fail, the entire sort operation will fail (and the list will likely be left in a partially modified state). accepts two arguments that can only be passed by keyword (keyword-only arguments): key specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each list element (for example, ). The key corresponding to each item in the list is calculated once and then used for the entire sorting process. The default value of means that list items are sorted directly without calculating a separate key value. The utility is available to convert a 2.x style cmp function to a key function. reverse is a boolean value. If set to , then the list elements are sorted as if each comparison were reversed. This method modifies the sequence in place for economy of space when sorting a large sequence. To remind users that it operates by side effect, it does not return the sorted sequence (use to explicitly request a new sorted list instance). The method is guaranteed to be stable. A sort is stable if it guarantees not to change the relative order of elements that compare equal — this is helpful for sorting in multiple passes (for example, sort by department, then by salary grade). For sorting examples and a brief sorting tutorial, see Sorting Techniques. CPython implementation detail: While a list is being sorted, the effect of attempting to mutate, or even inspect, the list is undefined. The C implementation of Python makes the list appear empty for the duration, and raises if it can detect that the list has been mutated during a sort. Tuples are immutable sequences, typically used to store collections of heterogeneous data (such as the 2-tuples produced by the built-in). Tuples are also used for cases where an immutable sequence of homogeneous data is needed (such as allowing storage in a or instance). Tuples may be constructed in a number of ways:\n• None Using a pair of parentheses to denote the empty tuple:\n• None Using a trailing comma for a singleton tuple: or\n• None Using the built-in: or The constructor builds a tuple whose items are the same and in the same order as iterable’s items. iterable may be either a sequence, a container that supports iteration, or an iterator object. If iterable is already a tuple, it is returned unchanged. For example, returns and returns . If no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty tuple, . Note that it is actually the comma which makes a tuple, not the parentheses. The parentheses are optional, except in the empty tuple case, or when they are needed to avoid syntactic ambiguity. For example, is a function call with three arguments, while is a function call with a 3-tuple as the sole argument. Tuples implement all of the common sequence operations. For heterogeneous collections of data where access by name is clearer than access by index, may be a more appropriate choice than a simple tuple object. The type represents an immutable sequence of numbers and is commonly used for looping a specific number of times in loops. The arguments to the range constructor must be integers (either built-in or any object that implements the special method). If the step argument is omitted, it defaults to . If the start argument is omitted, it defaults to . If step is zero, is raised. For a positive step, the contents of a range are determined by the formula where and . For a negative step, the contents of the range are still determined by the formula , but the constraints are and . A range object will be empty if does not meet the value constraint. Ranges do support negative indices, but these are interpreted as indexing from the end of the sequence determined by the positive indices. Ranges containing absolute values larger than are permitted but some features (such as ) may raise . Ranges implement all of the common sequence operations except concatenation and repetition (due to the fact that range objects can only represent sequences that follow a strict pattern and repetition and concatenation will usually violate that pattern). The value of the start parameter (or if the parameter was not supplied) The value of the stop parameter The value of the step parameter (or if the parameter was not supplied) The advantage of the type over a regular or is that a object will always take the same (small) amount of memory, no matter the size of the range it represents (as it only stores the , and values, calculating individual items and subranges as needed). Range objects implement the ABC, and provide features such as containment tests, element index lookup, slicing and support for negative indices (see Sequence Types — list, tuple, range): Testing range objects for equality with and compares them as sequences. That is, two range objects are considered equal if they represent the same sequence of values. (Note that two range objects that compare equal might have different , and attributes, for example or .) Changed in version 3.2: Implement the Sequence ABC. Support slicing and negative indices. Test objects for membership in constant time instead of iterating through all items. Changed in version 3.3: Define ‘==’ and ‘!=’ to compare range objects based on the sequence of values they define (instead of comparing based on object identity).\n• None The linspace recipe shows how to implement a lazy version of range suitable for floating-point applications."

In text mode, if encoding is not specified the encoding used is platform-dependent: is called to get the current locale encoding. (For reading and writing raw bytes use binary mode and leave encoding unspecified.) The available modes are: open for writing, truncating the file first open for exclusive creation, failing if the file already exists open for writing, appending to the end of file if it exists The default mode is (open for reading text, a synonym of ). Modes and open and truncate the file. Modes and open the file with no truncation. As mentioned in the Overview, Python distinguishes between binary and text I/O. Files opened in binary mode (including in the mode argument) return contents as objects without any decoding. In text mode (the default, or when is included in the mode argument), the contents of the file are returned as , the bytes having been first decoded using a platform-dependent encoding or using the specified encoding if given. Python doesn’t depend on the underlying operating system’s notion of text files; all the processing is done by Python itself, and is therefore platform-independent. buffering is an optional integer used to set the buffering policy. Pass 0 to switch buffering off (only allowed in binary mode), 1 to select line buffering (only usable when writing in text mode), and an integer > 1 to indicate the size in bytes of a fixed-size chunk buffer. Note that specifying a buffer size this way applies for binary buffered I/O, but (i.e., files opened with ) would have another buffering. To disable buffering in , consider using the flag for . When no buffering argument is given, the default buffering policy works as follows:\n• None Binary files are buffered in fixed-size chunks; the size of the buffer is chosen using a heuristic trying to determine the underlying device’s “block size” and falling back on . On many systems, the buffer will typically be 4096 or 8192 bytes long.\n• None “Interactive” text files (files for which returns ) use line buffering. Other text files use the policy described above for binary files. encoding is the name of the encoding used to decode or encode the file. This should only be used in text mode. The default encoding is platform dependent (whatever returns), but any text encoding supported by Python can be used. See the module for the list of supported encodings. errors is an optional string that specifies how encoding and decoding errors are to be handled—this cannot be used in binary mode. A variety of standard error handlers are available (listed under Error Handlers), though any error handling name that has been registered with is also valid. The standard names include:\n• None to raise a exception if there is an encoding error. The default value of has the same effect.\n• None ignores errors. Note that ignoring encoding errors can lead to data loss.\n• None causes a replacement marker (such as ) to be inserted where there is malformed data.\n• None will represent any incorrect bytes as low surrogate code units ranging from U+DC80 to U+DCFF. These surrogate code units will then be turned back into the same bytes when the error handler is used when writing data. This is useful for processing files in an unknown encoding.\n• None is only supported when writing to a file. Characters not supported by the encoding are replaced with the appropriate XML character reference .\n• None (also only supported when writing) replaces unsupported characters with escape sequences. newline determines how to parse newline characters from the stream. It can be , , , , and . It works as follows:\n• None When reading input from the stream, if newline is , universal newlines mode is enabled. Lines in the input can end in , , or , and these are translated into before being returned to the caller. If it is , universal newlines mode is enabled, but line endings are returned to the caller untranslated. If it has any of the other legal values, input lines are only terminated by the given string, and the line ending is returned to the caller untranslated.\n• None When writing output to the stream, if newline is , any characters written are translated to the system default line separator, . If newline is or , no translation takes place. If newline is any of the other legal values, any characters written are translated to the given string. If closefd is and a file descriptor rather than a filename was given, the underlying file descriptor will be kept open when the file is closed. If a filename is given closefd must be (the default); otherwise, an error will be raised. A custom opener can be used by passing a callable as opener. The underlying file descriptor for the file object is then obtained by calling opener with (file, flags). opener must return an open file descriptor (passing as opener results in functionality similar to passing ). The following example uses the dir_fd parameter of the function to open a file relative to a given directory: 'This will be written to somedir/spamspam.txt' The type of file object returned by the function depends on the mode. When is used to open a file in a text mode ( , , , , etc.), it returns a subclass of (specifically ). When used to open a file in a binary mode with buffering, the returned class is a subclass of . The exact class varies: in read binary mode, it returns an ; in write binary and append binary modes, it returns an , and in read/write mode, it returns an . When buffering is disabled, the raw stream, a subclass of , , is returned. See also the file handling modules, such as , (where is declared), , , , and . The and arguments may have been modified or inferred from the original call.\n• None used to be raised, it is now an alias of .\n• None is now raised if the file opened in exclusive creation mode ( ) already exists.\n• None The file is now non-inheritable.\n• None If the system call is interrupted and the signal handler does not raise an exception, the function now retries the system call instead of raising an exception (see PEP 475 for the rationale).\n• None On Windows, opening a console buffer may return a subclass of other than . Changed in version 3.11: The mode has been removed.\n\nReturn a proxy object that delegates method calls to a parent or sibling class of type. This is useful for accessing inherited methods that have been overridden in a class. The object_or_type determines the method resolution order to be searched. The search starts from the class right after the type. For example, if of object_or_type is and the value of type is , then searches . The attribute of the class corresponding to object_or_type lists the method resolution search order used by both and . The attribute is dynamic and can change whenever the inheritance hierarchy is updated. If the second argument is omitted, the super object returned is unbound. If the second argument is an object, must be true. If the second argument is a type, must be true (this is useful for classmethods). When called directly within an ordinary method of a class, both arguments may be omitted (“zero-argument ”). In this case, type will be the enclosing class, and obj will be the first argument of the immediately enclosing function (typically ). (This means that zero-argument will not work as expected within nested functions, including generator expressions, which implicitly create nested functions.) There are two typical use cases for super. In a class hierarchy with single inheritance, super can be used to refer to parent classes without naming them explicitly, thus making the code more maintainable. This use closely parallels the use of super in other programming languages. The second use case is to support cooperative multiple inheritance in a dynamic execution environment. This use case is unique to Python and is not found in statically compiled languages or languages that only support single inheritance. This makes it possible to implement “diamond diagrams” where multiple base classes implement the same method. Good design dictates that such implementations have the same calling signature in every case (because the order of calls is determined at runtime, because that order adapts to changes in the class hierarchy, and because that order can include sibling classes that are unknown prior to runtime). For both use cases, a typical superclass call looks like this: # This does the same thing as: In addition to method lookups, also works for attribute lookups. One possible use case for this is calling descriptors in a parent or sibling class. Note that is implemented as part of the binding process for explicit dotted attribute lookups such as . It does so by implementing its own method for searching classes in a predictable order that supports cooperative multiple inheritance. Accordingly, is undefined for implicit lookups using statements or operators such as . Also note that, aside from the zero argument form, is not limited to use inside methods. The two argument form specifies the arguments exactly and makes the appropriate references. The zero argument form only works inside a class definition, as the compiler fills in the necessary details to correctly retrieve the class being defined, as well as accessing the current instance for ordinary methods.

As an example, let's replace 'Rio' for 'Mar'.\n\nRio means River in Portuguese and Mar means Sea – just so you know that I didn't choose this replacement so randomly.\n\nSpecify what to count as an argument.\n\nIn this case, we are counting how many spaces exist in \"Rio de Janeiro\", which is 2.\n\nYou can use the symbol to repeat a string.\n\nHere we are multiplying the word \"Tokyo\" by 3.\n\nHow to Split a String in Python\n\nSplitting a string into smaller parts is a very common task. To do so, we use the method in Python.\n\nLet's see some examples on how to do that.\n\nExample 1: use whitespaces as delimiters\n\nIn this example, we split the phrase by whitespaces creating a list named my_words with five items corresponding to each word in the phrase.\n\nNotice that, by default, the method uses any consecutive number of whitespaces as delimiters. We can change the code above to:\n\nThe output is the same since we only have one whitespace between each word.\n\nExample 2: pass different arguments as delimiters\n\nWhen working with data, it's very common to read some CSV files to extract information from them.\n\nAs such, you might need to store some specific data from a certain column.\n\nCSV files usually have fields separated by a semicolon \";\" or a comma \",\".\n\nIn this example, we are going to use the method passing as argument a specific delimiter, \";\" in this case.\n\nHow to Remove All White Spaces in a String in Python\n\nIf you want to truly remove any space in a string, leaving only the characters, the best solution is to use a regular expression.\n\nYou need to import the module that provides regular expression operations.\n\nNotice that the represents not only space , but also form feed , line feed , carriage return , tab , and vertical tab .\n\nThe symbol is called a quantifier and is read as 'one or more'. This means that it will consider, in this case, one or more white spaces since it is positioned right after the .\n\nThe original variable remains the same. You have to assign the new cleaned string to a new variable, in this case.\n\nHow to Handle Multiline Strings in Python\n\nTo handle multiline strings in Python you use triple quotes, either single or double.\n\nThis first example uses double quotes.\n\nNow the same as before, but with single quotes:\n\nNotice that both outputs are the same.\n\nLet's see an example with parentheses.\n\nAs you can see, the result is not the same. To achieve new lines I have to add , like this:\n\nNotice there is no space after the character, as it would throw an error.\n\nlstrip(): How to Remove Spaces and Chars from the Beginning of a String in Python\n\nUse the method to remove spaces from the beginning of a string.\n\nNotice that the original variable remains unchanged, thus you need to assign the return of the method to a new variable, in this case.\n\nThe method also accepts specific chars for removal as parameters.\n\nrstrip(): How to Remove Spaces and Chars from the End of a String in Python\n\nUse the method to remove spaces from the end of a string.\n\nNotice that the original variable remains unchanged, so you need to assign the return of the method to a new variable, in this case.\n\nThe method also accepts specific chars for removal as parameters.\n\nstrip(): How to Remove Spaces and Chars from the Beginning and End of a String in Python\n\nUse the method to remove spaces from the beginning and the end of a string.\n\nNotice that the original variable remains unchanged, so you need to assign the return of the method to a new variable, in this case.\n\nThe method also accepts specific chars for removal as parameters.\n\nHow to Make a Whole String Lowercase in Python\n\nUse the method to transform a whole string into lowercase.\n\nNotice that the original variable remains unchanged, thus you need to assign the return of the method to a new variable, in this case.\n\nHow to Make a Whole String Uppercase in Python\n\nUse the method to transform a whole string into uppercase.\n\nNotice that the original variable remains unchanged, thus you need to assign the return of the method to a new variable, in this case.\n\nHow to Use Title Case in Python\n\nUse the method to transform the first letter in each word into upper case and the rest of characters into lower case.\n\nNotice that the original variable remains unchanged, so you need to assign the return of the method to a new variable, in this case.\n\nHow to Use Swap Case in Python\n\nUse the method to transform the upper case characters into lower case and vice versa.\n\nNotice that the original variable remains unchanged, so you need to assign the return of the method to a new variable, in this case.\n\nHow to Check if a String is Empty in Python\n\nThe pythonic way to check if a is empty is using the operator.\n\nTo check the opposite and see if the string is not empty, do this:\n\nrjust(): How to Right-justify a String in Python\n\nUse the to right-justify a string.\n\nNotice the spaces in the second string. The word 'beach' has 5 characters, which gives us 27 spaces to fill with empty space.\n\nThe original variable remains unchanged, so we need to assign the return of the method to a new variable, in this case.\n\nThe also accepts a specific char as a parameter to fill the remaining space.\n\nSimilar to the first situation, I have 27 signs to make it 32 total when I count the 5 chars contained in the word 'beach'.\n\nljust(): How to Left-justify a String in Python\n\nUse the to left-justify a string.\n\nNotice the spaces in the second string. The word 'beach' has 5 characters, which gives us 27 spaces to fill with empty space.\n\nThe original variable remains unchanged, thus we need to assign the return of the method to a new variable, in this case.\n\nThe also accepts a specific char as a parameter to fill the remaining space.\n\nSimilar to the first situation, I have 27 signs to make it 32 total when I count the 5 chars contained in the word 'beach'.\n\nisalnum(): How to Check for Alphanumeric Characters Only in a String in Python\n\nUse the method to check if a string only contains alphanumeric characters.\n\nisprintable(): How to Check for Printable Characters in a String in Python\n\nUse the method to check if the characters in a string are printable.\n\nNotice that in the first 4 examples, each character takes some space, even if it is an empty space as you can see in the first example.\n\nThe last example returns , showing 5 kinds of characters that are non-printable: form feed , line feed , carriage return , tab , and vertical tab .\n\nSome of these 'invisible' characters may mess up your printing, giving you an unxpected output, even when everything 'looks' alright.\n\nisspace(): How to Check for White Space Only in a String in Python\n\nUse the method to check if the characters in a string are all white spaces.\n\nNotice in the second example that white space is not only , but also form feed , line feed , carriage return , tab , and vertical tab .\n\nstartswith(): How to Check if a String Begins with a Certain Value in Python\n\nUse the method to check if a string begins with a certain value.\n\nYou can also set if you want to begin the match in a specific position and end it in another specific position of the string.\n\nFinally, you might want to check for multiple strings at once. Instead of using some kind of loop, you can use a tuple as an argument with all the strings you want to match against.\n\ncapitalize(): How to Set the First Character Only to Upper Case in a String in Python\n\nUse the method to convert to upper case only the first character in a string.\n\nThe rest of the string is converted to lower case.\n\nNotice that any character counts, such as a number or a special character. So in the last example, is the first character and suffers no alterations while the rest of the string is converted to lower case.\n\nisupper(): How to Check for Upper Case Only in a String in Python\n\nUse the method to check if the characters in a string are all in upper case.\n\nIf you notice the last example, the numbers and special characters like and in the string make no difference and still returns because the method only verifies the alphabetical characters.\n\njoin(): How to Join Items of an Iterable into One String in Python\n\nUse the method to join all the items if an iterable into a string.\n\nAs per the syntax above, a string is required as a separator.\n\nThe method returns a new string, which means that the original iterator remains unchanged.\n\nSince the method only accepts strings, if any element in the iterable is of a different type, an error will be thrown.\n\nLet's see some examples with: string, list, tuple, set, and dictionary\n\nThe method puts the sign as a separator for every character in the string.\n\nI have a simple list of three items representing car brands.\n\nThe method is gonna use the sign as a separator.\n\nIt concatenates all the items on the list and puts the sign between them.\n\nThis example reminds you that does not work with non-string items.\n\nWhen trying to concatenate the items, an error is raised.\n\nThe tuple follows the same rationale as the list example explained before.\n\nAgain, I'm using the sign as a separator.\n\nSince the set is also the same as the tuple and the list, I've used a different separator in this example.\n\nThe dictionary has a catch when you use the method: it joins the keys, not the values.\n\nThis example shows the concatenation of the keys.\n\nsplitlines(): How to Split a String at Line Breaks in Python\n\nUse the method to split a string at line breaks.\n\nThe return of the method is a list of the lines.\n\nIf you want to keep the line break, the accepts a parameter that can be set to True, the default is False.\n\nislower(): How to Check for Lower Case Only in a String in Python\n\nUse the method to check if the characters in a string are all in lower case.\n\nIf you notice in the last example, the numbers and special characters like and in the string make no difference and still returns because the method only verifies the alphabetical characters.\n\nisnumeric(): How to Check for Numerics Only in a String in Python\n\nUse the method to check if a string only contains numeric chars.\n\nNumerics include numbers from 0 to 9 and combinations of them, Roman numerals, superscripts, subscripts, fractions, and other variations.\n\nis stricter than , which in its turn is stricter than .\n\nisdigit(): How to Check for Digits Only in a String in Python\n\nUse the method to check if a string only contains digits.\n\nDigits include numbers from 0 to 9 and also superscripts and subscripts.\n\nis stricter than , which in its turn is stricter than .\n\nisdecimal(): How to Check for Decimals Only in a String in Python\n\nUse the method to check if a string only contains decimals, that is, only numbers from 0 to 9 and combinations of these numbers.\n\nSubscripts, superscripts, Roman numerals, and other variations will be returned as .\n\nis more strict than , which in its turn is more strict than .\n\nisalpha(): How to Chedck for Letters Only in a String in Python\n\nUse the method to check if a string only contains letters.\n\nistitle(): How to Check if Every Word Begins with an Upper Case Char in a String in Python\n\nUse the method to check if the first character in every word in a string is upper case and the other characters are lower case.\n\nIf you notice in the last example, the numbers and special characters like and in the string make no difference and still returns because the method only verifies the alphabetical characters.\n\nexpandtabs(): How to Set the Number of Spaces for a Tab in a String in Python\n\nUse the method to set the number of spaces for a tab.\n\nYou can set any number of spaces, but when no argument is given, the default is 8.\n\nNotice the 7 spaces between the letters B and R.\n\nThe is at position two after one character, so it will be replaced with 7 spaces.\n\nLet's look at another example.\n\nSince has four characters, the is replaced with 4 spaces to make it a total of 8, the default tabsize.\n\nThe code below gives us 4 spaces for the first tab after four characters 'WORL' and 7 spaces for the second tab after one character 'D'.\n\nIt is possible to set the tabsize as needed.\n\nIn this example the tabsize is 4, which gives us 3 spaces after the char 'B'.\n\nThis code has tabsize set to 6, which gives us 5 spaces after the char 'B'.\n\ncenter(): How to Center a String in Python\n\nUse the method to center a string.\n\nNotice the spaces in the second string. The word 'beach' has 5 characters, which gives us 28 spaces to fill with empty space, 14 spaces before and 14 after to center the word.\n\nThe original variable remains unchanged, so we need to assign the return of the method to a new variable, in this case.\n\nThe also accepts a specific character as a parameter to fill the remaining space.\n\nSimilar to the first situation, I have 14 in each side to make it 33 total when I count the 5 chars contained in the word 'beach'.\n\nzfill(): How to Add Zeros to a String in Python\n\nUse the to insert zeros at the beginning of a string.\n\nThe number of zeros is given by the number passed as an argument minus the number of chars in the string.\n\nThe word 'beach' has 5 characters, which gives us 27 spaces to fill with zeros to make it 32 total as specified in the variable\n\nThe original variable remains unchanged, so we need to assign the return of the method to a new variable, in this case.\n\nAlso notice that if the argument is less than the number of chars in the string, nothing changes.\n\nIn the example below, 'beach' has 5 chars and we want to add zeros until it reaches the of 4, which means there is nothing to be done.\n\nfind(): How to Check if a String Has a Certain Substring in Python\n\nUse the method to check if a string has a certain substring.\n\nThe method returns the index of the first occurrence of the given value.\n\nIf the value is not found, it will return .\n\nYou can also choose to begin the search in a specific position and end it in another specific position of the string.\n\nHow to Remove a Prefix or a Suffix in a String in Python\n\nAs of Python 3.9, the String type will have two new methods.\n\nYou can specifically remove a prefix from a string using the method:\n\nOr remove a suffix using the method:\n\nSimply pass as an argument the text to be considered as prefix or suffix to be removed and the method will return a new string as a result.\n\nI recommend reading the PEP 616 in the official documentation if you are curious about how these features are added to the language.\n\nThis one is a pretty simple change and very friendly for beginners to get used to reading the official documentation.\n\nlstrip() vs removeprefix() and rstrip() vs removesuffix()\n\nThis causes confusion for many people.\n\nIt is easy to look at and and wonder what is the real difference between the two.\n\nWhen using , the argument is a set of leading characters that will be removed as many times as they occur:\n\nWhile will remove only the exact match:\n\nYou can use the same rationale to distinguish between and .\n\nAnd as a bonus, just in case you have never worked with regular expressions before, be grateful that you have to trim character sets from a string instead of a regular expression:\n\nSlicing is one of the most useful tools in the Python language.\n\nAs such, it is important to have a good grasp of how it works.\n\nLet's say we have an array called 'list'.\n• start: where you want the slicing to begin\n• stop: until where you want the slicing to go, but remember the value of stop is not included\n• step: if you want to skip an item, the default being 1, so you go through all items in the array\n\nWhen slicing, The indices are points in between the characters, not on the characters.\n\nIf I slice from 0 until 2, I get 'mo' in the example above and not 'mov'.\n\nSince a string is just a list of characters, the same applies with a list:\n\nWe have a variable containing the string 'movie' like so:\n\nAll the examples below will be applied to this word.\n\nTo get the first two characters:\n\nNotice that we could have used 0 to denote the beginning, but that is not necessary.\n\nHow to Reverse a String in Python\n\nTo reverse a string, use the slice syntax:\n\nThe slice syntax allows you to set a step, which is in the example.\n\nThe default step is , that is, go forward 1 character of the string at a time.\n\nIf you set the step to you have the opposite, go back 1 character at a time.\n\nSo you start at the position of the last character and move backwards to the first character at position 0.\n\nI want to thank you for reading this article.\n\nIf you want to learn more, checkout my blog renanmf.com.\n\nRemember to download a PDF version of this Python String Manipulation Handbook.\n\nYou can also find me on Twitter: @renanmouraf."
