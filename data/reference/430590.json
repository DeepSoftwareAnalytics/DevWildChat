        "document": "Before you begin with Quasar, it is a good idea to get acquainted with ES6 and have a fairly good knowledge about how Vue works. (quick overview of ES6 and full description – don’t worry, you don’t need to understand ALL of ES6). For devs experienced with reactive UIs, the Vue documentation itself takes half a day at most to read top-to-bottom and will help you understand how Quasar components can be used and configured.\n\nIf you are a total beginner to Vue and reactive UI libraries and want a good tutorial, we recommend you take a look at the Udemy Course - Vue JS 2 - The Complete Guide.\n\nAfter reading the Vue documentation, let’s clear up some of the most frequently asked questions, like “How can I use Quasar components, Vue properties, methods and events”.\n\nYou’ll be building your Quasar app using files which contain multiple sections: ‘template’ (HTML), ‘script’ (Javascript) and ‘style’ (CSS).\n\nFor the tag, you can also use whatever CSS preprocessor you want. Stylus is available out of the box. For SCSS/SASS or LESS, you’ll need to install their Webpack loaders (example: or ).\n\nAfter installing the loader you need (remember Stylus is already installed for you), you can specify you want your chosen preprocessor to handle the CSS code you’re writing:\n\nIn the above example, you would replace with the preprocessor you’ve chosen.\n\nQuasar comes with a few custom Vue Directives. These directives can be applied on almost any DOM element or Component.\n\nIn order for you to use any of the directives that Quasar supplies, you first need to tell Quasar you want it embedded. Open file and add the following reference:\n\nLet’s take another example. We now also want TouchPan and TouchSwipe directives, so we add them too in :\n\n\n\nNow we can write in your Vue files template:\n\nQuasar components have names beginning with “Q” like “QBtn” or “QElementResizeObservable”. In order to use them, you need to add a reference to them in .\n\nLet’s take the following example with a QBtn and QIcon and then we’ll see how to embed these components in our app:\n\n\n\nNow on , you would add:\n\n\n\nQuasar Plugins are features that you can use both in your Vue files as well as outside of them, like Notify, ActionSheet, AppVisibility and so on.\n\nIn order to use them, you need to add a reference to them in :\n\n\n\nLet’s take Notify as an example and see how we can then use it. In a Vue file, you’d write something like this:\n\n\n\nNow let’s see an example of Notify being used outside of a Vue file:\n\n\n\nImporting All Components and Directives for Quick Test\n\nReferencing all Quasar Components, Directives and Plugins can be tiresome when you just want to do a quick test. In this case, you can tell Quasar to import them all by editing like this:\n\nSome Quasar components do not need you to include HTML content inside of them. In this case, you can use them as self closing tags. One example with QIcon below:\n\nSelf-closing means the above template is the equivalent to:\n\nBoth forms are valid and can be used. It works the same with regular DOM elements:\n\nSome eslint-plugin-vue linting rules actually enforce using the self-closing syntax.\n\nYou will notice throughout the documentation that Quasar components have a section called “Vue Properties”. These are often called Props in Vue documentation. Example:\n\nLet’s take some examples with a bogus Quasar component (we will call it QBogus) that supports the properties above. We will discuss each of the types of Vue properties in the below sections.\n\nA boolean property means it only accepts a strictly Boolean value. The values will not be cast to Boolean, so you must ensure you are using a true Boolean.\n\nIf you are trying to control that property and change it dynamically at runtime, then bind it to a variable in your scope:\n\n\n\nIf, on the other hand, you know this Boolean value is not going to change, you can use the shorthand version of the variable like a component attribute and just specify it. In other words, if you don’t bind the variable to a variable in the component’s scope as it will always be :\n\n <template>\n\n <q-bogus infinite />\n\n\n\n <!--\n\n the following is perfectly valid,\n\n but it's a longer version\n\n -->\n\n <q-bogus :infinite=\"true\" />\n\n</template>\n\n\n\nAs you can imagine, Strings are required as a value for this type of property.\n\n\n\nYou will notice throughout the documentation that some Quasar components have a section called “Vue Methods”. Example:\n\nIn order for you to access these methods, you will need to set a Vue reference on the component first. Here’s an example:\n\nYou will notice throughout the documentation that some Quasar components have a section called “Vue Events”. Do not confuse these Vue events with the Global Event Bus as these two have nothing in common.\n\nExample of “Vue Events” section in docs:\n\nIn order for you to catch these events, when they are triggered, you will need to add listeners for them on the component itself in the HTML template. Here’s an example:\n\nThere are times when you need to access native DOM events on a Quasar component too, like the native . Do not confuse native events with the Vue events emitted by the component. They are different things. Let’s take an example: let’s say we have a component (QBogus) that emits and , but doesn’t emit a event. being a native DOM event, we can still catch it with the modifier:"

        "document": "Quasar is an open-source Vue.js-based cross-platform framework that allows you, as a developer, to easily build apps for both desktop and mobile using technologies such as Cordova and Electron and writing your code once. The app we’ll build will store and get its data from Firebase, meaning that we will also be seeing how to use Firebase in Quasar.\n\nIn this article, I will explain how to use Quasar Framework and its state-of-the-art UI (which follows Material guidelines) to build a notes app. The app will get its data from and store its data to Firebase. This tutorial is meant for anyone interested in building cross-platform applications that work well across all devices simultaneously. At the end of the article, you should have a proper understanding of what Quasar is, how to get started creating apps with Quasar, and also how to use Firebase.\n\nTo follow along in this article, you should have:\n• an understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript;\n• at least a little experience with Vue.js;\n• Node.js version 10 or above and npm version 5 or above installed on your machine.\n• knowledge of how the command-line interface (CLI) works.\n\nThe deployed app is available for viewing, and the final code is on Github.\n\nQuasar Framework is an open-source Vue.js-based cross-platform framework whose motto is: “write code once and simultaneously deploy it as a website, a mobile app and/or an Electron app”. It has many features that enable you, as a web developer, to build apps on desktop and mobile and to create progressive web apps (PWAs) using technologies such as Cordova, Electron, and the web (Vue.js).\n\nQuasar is an easy-to-use but powerful UI kit comprising a lot of UI components, layout elements, and helpers. Together, these elements provide a full-featured toolset for building responsive front-end apps, without your having to make use of many different UI libraries. It does the heavy lifting for you, allowing you to focus on features and not boilerplate.\n\nIn summary, Quasar offers support for many build modes, including:\n• mobile apps (iOS and Android), using Cordova or Сapacitor;\n\nTo get started, let’s look at how to install Quasar on your local machine and set up a project.\n\nThere are three ways to start using Quasar:\n• embedding to an existing project via a content delivery network (CDN);\n\nFor this tutorial, we will be using the third method, which is the Quasar CLI. The first thing to do is install the Quasar CLI globally on your computer, or check whether it is installed by running the following commands in your CLI:\n\nOnce this is done, you can now move on to setting up the project.\n\nRun the following command in your CLI:\n\nFollowing this, you are going to be asked some questions. Here is my full configuration for the app we will be building.\n\nNow we can move into the project folder and start up the application using the following commands:\n\nWith the steps above complete, our app should be running on http://localhost:8080. This is what we should see:\n\nThe default application structure for Quasar is intended to be a great starting point for developers to build any type of application. You can organize the application however you like and create directories whenever you need them.\n\nThe source folder consists of about seven major directories that a beginner should care about:\n• This is the brain behind any Quasar application, because most configurations are done in this file. Amazingly, Quasar handles most of the complex configurations needed by the various tools and packages that you might use in an application. Some of these configurations are for:\n• Quasar components, directives, and plugins that would be needed in your app;\n• The directory contains your uncompiled assets, such as Stylus or Sass files, images, and fonts.\n• This is where all of your reusable components will live. These components make up the different parts of the application and can be reused and imported into your pages, layouts, and even other components.\n• You will not find this in Vue.js, but Quasar provides this so that we can have all of our global CSS in Sass form. It consists of two files: is where all of our styles will go, while contains all of the reusable variables we would want to make use of when styling our app. You could ignore the CSS directory if you feel it’s of no use to you.\n• This helps us create defined layouts for an app without repeating code. This is useful when you want to include sidebars or fixed bottom bars or have distinct layouts for mobile and desktop.\n• The directory contains our application’s views and routes. Our pages are injected into the app and managed through Vue Router in . This means that each page needs to be referenced there.\n• This holds the routing configuration of our app. It consists of two folders:\n• holds the routes of the app, loading our layouts alongside the routes or pages in the app.\n\nYou might not need to do anything to the file in a small project, but if your project will have routes, you will need to add them to the file.\n\nWhen building an application with Quasar, the first thing we will want to do is create a layout. Quasar has made this process a lot easier than any other framework by making use of a layout builder. For our notes app, we will want something like the following, which is quite similar to the default layout but with a few modifications:\n\nIn the sidebar of Quasar’s documentation, you will see the “Layout and Grid” option. When you click it, a dropdown will appear with more options, one of which is “Layout Builder”. Click on “Layout Builder”, which will bring you here:\n\nThis allows us to choose the options we want and remove the ones we don’t. Then, we would generate the code to paste in the layout file.\n\nThe first option helps us to pick the layout parts, while the second allows us to configure the layout parts. Finally, we export the generated layout.\n\nIf you want the exact same layout as mine, use the code below:\n\nRemove the default layout and paste the code above or the code that you have generated into .\n\nThe code above is divided into three sections: the header (navbar), the drawer (sidebar), and the page container (which contains the router view).\n\nWe’ve made use of the state-of-the-art UI to style the whole page. As I said earlier, when using Quasar, you won’t need additional heavy libraries such as Hammer.js, Moment.js, or Bootstrap.\n\nWe will be adding data to the sidebar and editing the navbar. Once you’ve saved, you will notice our app now looks like this:\n\nLet’s work on the layout, adding some items to the sidebar and changing the title of the app, If you scan the layout code that we added, you will see where we are supposed to edit and add these various items.\n\nHere is what my layout looks like after I’ve added items to the sidebar and changed the title:\n\nAnd here is the code:\n\nWe removed the logo in the navbar and edited the text, then added a list to the sidebar, making use of Quasar’s state-of-the-art UI. Check out the list items, and copy the code of any you wish to use.\n\nEarlier on, I said I was going to use Quasar’s state-of-the-art UI (which follows Material guidelines) to build a notes app, and that’s what we will be doing now. Explaining the whole process in an article like this is difficult, but the “Style & Identity” section of Quasar’s documentation covers it well.\n\nThis will be a one-page app ( ), and here is the code, without any styling applied:\n\nIn the code above, we have an input field from Quasar. We’ve attached a to get the data from the input field once the “Submit” button is clicked. We also have a list of items that will be used to display each note, and each list item has an icon used to delete that particular item when clicked.\n\nAt this point, the design of our app is in place. The next thing we will do is create an array that would contain all of our notes. We will ensure that we can add to and delete from this array before setting up Firebase.\n\nHere is the array that we will be making use of in our app for now. Later, we will remove this array or comment out the code.\n\nWe now have our array. Let’s add these data to our app. Because we understand Vue.js, all we will do is loop through this array using the directive, use the data gotten from the array, and then put the content wherever we want it to appear.\n\nWe also added a click event handler to the delete button, so that it loads this function whenever it’s created.\n\nLet’s see how to add notes to our app by using the input field. We will use JavaScript’s methods, which adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array.\n\nThe first thing to do is to add a click event handler to the button.\n\nThen, proceed to create this method in the script area.\n\nIn the code above, we created an object for the new note, which comprises the ID and the note itself, and then we added this to the array of via the method.\n\nFinally, before proceeding to use Firebase in our app, let’s see how to delete a note. The first thing would be to add an event listener to the delete icon:\n\nAnd then we would create a method:\n\nIn this code, we got the of the particular note that we want to delete through the parameter passed to the click event method that was created. Then, we made use of the method to remove only that item from the array.\n\nNow that these two pieces of functionality work, let’s now see how we can use Firebase in Quasar to add, fetch, and delete data. Firebase will also give us real-time data syncing across all devices. The data in our app won’t be very much, because it’s just for the purpose of learning. In case you are thinking of something big that would be used by millions of people, check out the pricing page.\n\nFirebase is application development software from Google that enables us to develop iOS, Android, and web apps.\n\nTo get started, visit firebase.google.com and click on either the “Go to console” link in the top-right corner of your screen or the “Get started” button (ensure that you sign in with your Google account).\n\nThis will bring us to the console area, where we can create a project. Click on the “Add a project” button, and a form to create your project will appear. The first question will request the project’s name, which could be anything; for this article, we will call it “notesApp”. Let’s also disable Google Analytics because ours is a mini-app.\n\nClick on the “Create project” button (this might take few seconds, so be patient). Then, click on “Continue”, so that we can create our cloud Firestore.\n\nIn the sidebar, click on “Firestore”, and then “Create database”.\n\nThis will bring up a modal. Click on “Start in test mode”, which will make it easy for us to start working with our database. Bear in mind that, “The default security rules for test mode allow anyone with your database reference to view, edit and delete all data in your database for the next 30 days”.\n\nClick on “Next”, leave the default Cloud Firestore location, and then click on the “Enable” button. Once it loads, our database will be fully ready for us to use.\n\nNote: The Firebase database is made up of collections, and these collections contain documents, and each document is a JavaScript object that has fields in it.\n\nLet’s get started by creating a new collection for our notes.\n\nTo create a collection, click on “Start collection”. A modal will pop up for you to enter the collection ID — meaning, a name. Then, click on the “Next” button.\n\nYou can now start creating the documents and fields for each note. Auto-generate the ID of the document to ensure that it is unique by clicking “Auto-ID” beside the document field.\n\nClick “Save”, and continue to create more documents. In the end, this is what my database looks like:\n\nNow that we are done, let’s see how to connect Firebase to our app. Go to “Project overview” in the sidebar, and let’s add this to a web app by clicking the “Web” button.\n\nA form will appear for us to “Add Firebase” to our web app. We will give it the same name, “notesApp”, and register the app (don’t check the “Firebase hosting” field).\n\nOnce it has loaded, it will bring up an SDK to help us initialize our database in the app. We won’t do it this way, although we will need some information from the generated SDK. The right way to do this in Quasar is to import the modules that we need and use a boot file.\n\nSo, leave that tab open, and let’s see how to add the Firebase SDK and initialize Firebase in our Quasar app.\n\nThe first thing to do would be to install Firebase in our project with npm.\n\nOnce installation is complete, we are going to initialize our app’s connection to Firebase by creating a boot file, so that we have immediate access to the database when our app is ready.\n\nA boot file helps us to run code before the app’s Vue.js root component is instantiated. Quasar’s documentation has more information about boot files and when to use boot files.\n\nTo generate a boot file, we will run this command in our CLI:\n\nNote: You don’t need to use Firebase as the name of the boot file.\n\nOnce this is done, you will notice that the file is now created in the folder. To make use of this newly created boot file, we’ll need to add it to the file’s boot array.\n\nLet’s go back to the newly created boot file. Delete all of the code there because we don’t need it. We’ll import the modules that we need and configure our database. Paste in the following code:\n\nHere, we’ve imported Firebase itself and Firestore, and we’ve initialized Firebase, making use of the config, which we will be adding now.\n\nAt this point, we are almost done configuring our app. We need to add our unique configuration, which was provided in the SDK that was generated when we added Firebase to our web app. Copy only the configuration, and paste it into our array.\n\nWe should now have something like this:\n\nOne last thing, since we are making use of Firestore, is that we’ll need to initialize the cloud Firestore by adding this code to our boot file (the last line):\n\nThis will give us access to our Firestore database. We also exported it so that we can use it anywhere in our app.\n\nAt this point, you might still be a little confused, but if you have followed this guide, then you will have properly initialized Firebase for your application. You can read more about adding Firebase to your JavaScript project in the documentation.\n\nIf you have followed the guide so far, everything should work fine once you launch your app. Now let’s grab the notes created in the database and display them in our app.\n\nFor this, we will be making use of the hook, which will be fired any time the data in our collection changes. This will tell us whether a document has been added, removed, or updated. For this guide, we will only deal with the addition and removal of documents. Using hooks like this makes real-time syncing across devices possible. Let’s get started.\n\nThe first thing to do would be for us to get access to the database by importing it into the index page of our app.\n\nThen, create a mounted hook, because we want to fetch our data immediately after the app has loaded.\n\nIn the code above, we are simply grabbing our collection, and every time there is a change in the collection, the method will be fired, which will return a of all our data. All of these data will be objects with properties. These properties will tell us the type of change that has happened and give us access to the data that was either added, modified, or removed.\n\nThis might sound confusing, but you will understand what we are doing as you read on.\n\nIf you save your code and check the console environment, you will notice that each note has been logged out. We can now push these objects to the array that we created earlier, so that we can display real-time data in our application.\n\nThe first thing to do is delete or comment out the objects in the array, so that we have something like this:\n\nThen, pass the objects to this array:\n\nYour code should now look like this:\n\nAt this point, if you load the app, you will notice that you have successfully fetched your data from Firebase.\n\nLet’s see how to add a note to our notes collection in this app. At this point, if you try to use the input field to add a note, it will work but the note will disappear once you refresh the page because it’s not stored in any database.\n\nTo do this with Firebase, all that is needed is to update the method that we created earlier.\n\nThe first thing we did here was remove the ID that is used when we made use of the previous array, because we are now going to auto-generate the ID from Firebase. We also removed the method; it’s no longer useful because data is being fetched for our app once there is an update using the hook.\n\nIf we look at the code responsible for updating the Firestore , all we are passing to the collection ( ) is the new object ( ), and this function will automatically generate an ID for each of our documents. The documentation has more information on adding data to Firebase.\n\nWe are almost done with our app, but we need to be able to delete data in our app from Firebase. Currently, the function works, but if you reload the app, the deleted data will reappear.\n\nAs we did before, we are going to delete these data (or documents) from Firebase using the unique ID generated by Firebase.\n\nCurrently, we don’t have access to the ID. To access it, we will add it to the object:\n\nOnce that is set, deleting data will be as easy as adding it. All we have to do is go to the method that we created previously, delete the previous code, and make use of this:\n\nThis checks the notes collection for a document with the specified ID and then deletes it. But if we save our code now and click the delete icon, the data will delete but won’t leave the app’s interface unless we refresh our code, meaning that the hook needs to be updated. Go to the hook for , and add this code:\n\nThis simply gets the ID of the post that we deleted and removes it from the interface.\n\nWith that done, we have built an app with Quasar that works with Firebase. One major advantage of Quasar is that it enables us to simultaneously deploy our project as a website, mobile app, or Electron app.\n\nTo deploy for iOS, Cordova needs to be installed on our local machine. A MacBook is highly preferable. Navigate to your CLI, and install Cordova globally:\n\nTo install on Windows, you would make use of Electron. The documentation properly explains how to do this.\n\nIn this guide, we have built a notes application using Quasar and Firebase. By following this guide, you are now in a position to improve on and add your own features and functionality.

This means Dialogs should only be used for quick user actions.\n\nThe advantage of using Dialogs as Quasar Plugins as opposed to QDialog component is that the plugin can also be called from outside of Vue space and doesn’t require you to manage their templates. But as a result, their customization cannot be compared to their component counterpart.\n\nHowever, you can also supply a component for the Dialog Plugin to render (see the “Invoking custom component” section) which is a great way to avoid cluttering your Vue templates with inline dialogs (and it will also help you better organize your project files and also reuse dialogs).\n\nWith the QDialog plugin, you can programmatically build three types of dialogs with the following form content:\n• A prompt dialog - asking the user to fill in some sort of data in an input field.\n• A set of options for the user to select from using either radio buttons or toggles (singular selection only) or check boxes (for multiple selections).\n• A simple confirmation dialog, where the user can cancel or give their “ok” for a particular action or input.\n\nIn order to create #1, the prompting input form, you have the property within the object.\n\nIn order to create #2, the options selection form, you have the property within the object.\n\nPlease check the API card to see what the returned Object is.\n\nYou can also supply native HTML attributes to the inner QInput or QOptionGroup components, like in the example below.\n\nThere is a basic validation system that you can use so that the user won’t be able to submit the dialog (click/tap on “OK” or press ) until the expected values are filled in.\n\nYou can use HTML on title and message if you specify the prop. Please note that this can lead to XSS attacks, so make sure that you sanitize the message by yourself.\n\nYou can also invoke your own custom component rather than relying on the default one that the Dialog plugin comes with out of the box. But in this case you will be responsible for handling everything (including your own component props).\n\nThis feature is actually the “bread and butter” of the Dialog plugin. It helps you keep your other vue components html templates clean by separating and reusing your dialog’s functionality with ease.\n\nThe equivalent of the above with Options API is by directly using .\n\nWe will be using the useDialogPluginComponent composable.\n\nIf you want to define in Object form, then (requires Quasar v2.2.5+):\n\nWe will be using the useDialogPluginComponent composable.\n\nIf you want to define in Object form, then (requires Quasar v2.2.5+):\n\nQuasar handles the back button for you by default so it can hide any opened Dialogs instead of the default behavior which is to return to the previous page (which is not a nice user experience).\n\nHowever, should you wish to disable this behavior, edit your file:"
