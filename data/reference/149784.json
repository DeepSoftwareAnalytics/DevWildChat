        "document": "Properties combine aspects of both fields and methods. To the user of an object, a property appears to be a field; accessing the property requires the same syntax. To the implementer of a class, a property is one or two code blocks, representing a accessor and/or a or accessor. The code block for the accessor is executed when the property is read; the code block for the or accessor is executed when the property is assigned a value. A property without a accessor is considered read-only. A property without a accessor is considered write-only. A property that has both accessors is read-write. You can use an accessor instead of a accessor to enable the property to be set as part of object initialization but otherwise make it read-only.\n\nUnlike fields, properties aren't classified as variables. Therefore, you can't pass a property as a or parameter.\n\nProperties have many uses:\n• They can validate data before allowing a change.\n• They can transparently expose data on a class where that data is retrieved from some other source, such as a database.\n• They can take an action when data is changed, such as raising an event, or changing the value of other fields.\n\nProperties are declared in the class block by specifying the access level of the field, followed by the type of the property, followed by the name of the property, and followed by a code block that declares a -accessor and/or a accessor. For example:\n\nIn this example, is declared as a property so that the accessor can make sure that the value is set between 1 and 12. The property uses a private field to track the actual value. The real location of a property's data is often referred to as the property's \"backing store.\" It's common for properties to use private fields as a backing store. The field is marked private in order to make sure that it can only be changed by calling the property. For more information about public and private access restrictions, see Access Modifiers. Automatically implemented properties provide simplified syntax for simple property declarations. For more information, see Automatically implemented properties.\n\nBeginning with C# 13, you can use field backed properties to add validation to the accessor of an automatically implemented property, as shown in the following example:\n\nThe body of the accessor resembles that of a method. It must return a value of the property type. The C# compiler and Just-in-time (JIT) compiler detect common patterns for implementing the accessor, and optimizes those patterns. For example, a accessor that returns a field without performing any computation is likely optimized to a memory read of that field. Automatically implemented properties follow this pattern and benefit from these optimizations. However, a virtual accessor method can't be inlined because the compiler doesn't know at compile time which method might actually be called at run time. The following example shows a accessor that returns the value of a private field :\n\nWhen you reference the property, except as the target of an assignment, the accessor is invoked to read the value of the property. For example:\n\nThe accessor must be an expression-bodied member, or end in a return or throw statement, and control can't flow off the accessor body.\n\nThe accessor can be used to return the field value or to compute it and return it. For example:\n\nIn the previous example, if you don't assign a value to the property, it returns the value .\n\nThe accessor resembles a method whose return type is void. It uses an implicit parameter called , whose type is the type of the property. The compiler and JIT compiler also recognize common patterns for a or accessor. Those common patterns are optimized, directly writing the memory for the backing field. In the following example, a accessor is added to the property:\n\nWhen you assign a value to the property, the accessor is invoked by using an argument that provides the new value. For example:\n\nIt's an error to use the implicit parameter name, , for a local variable declaration in a accessor.\n\nThe code to create an accessor is the same as the code to create a accessor except that you use the keyword instead of . The difference is that the accessor can only be used in the constructor or by using an object-initializer.\n\nProperties can be marked as , , , , , or . These access modifiers define how users of the class can access the property. The and accessors for the same property can have different access modifiers. For example, the might be to allow read-only access from outside the type, and the can be or . For more information, see Access Modifiers.\n\nA property can be declared as a static property by using the keyword. Static properties are available to callers at any time, even if no instance of the class exists. For more information, see Static Classes and Static Class Members.\n\nA property can be marked as a virtual property by using the virtual keyword. Virtual properties enable derived classes to override the property behavior by using the override keyword. For more information about these options, see Inheritance.\n\nA property overriding a virtual property can also be sealed, specifying that for derived classes it's no longer virtual. Lastly, a property can be declared abstract. Abstract properties don't define an implementation in the class, and derived classes must write their own implementation. For more information about these options, see Abstract and Sealed Classes and Class Members.\n\nThis example demonstrates instance, static, and read-only properties. It accepts the name of the employee from the keyboard, increments by 1, and displays the Employee name and number.\n\nThis example demonstrates how to access a property in a base class that is hidden by another property that has the same name in a derived class:\n\nThe following are important points in the previous example:\n• The property in the derived class hides the property in the base class. In such a case, the modifier is used in the declaration of the property in the derived class:\n• The cast is used to access the hidden property in the base class:\n\nFor more information about hiding members, see the new Modifier.\n\nIn this example, two classes, and , implement an abstract class, , and override its abstract property.

        "document": "A property is a member that provides a flexible mechanism to read, write, or compute the value of a data field. Properties appear as public data members, but they're implemented as special methods called accessors. This feature enables callers to access data easily and still helps promote data safety and flexibility. The syntax for properties is a natural extension to fields. A field defines a storage location:\n\nA property definition contains declarations for a and accessor that retrieves and assigns the value of that property:\n\nThe preceding example shows an automatically implemented property. The compiler generates a hidden backing field for the property. The compiler also implements the body of the and accessors. Any attributes are applied to the automatically implemented property. You can apply the attribute to the compiler-generated backing field by specifying the tag on the attribute.\n\nYou can initialize a property to a value other than the default by setting a value after the closing brace for the property. You might prefer the initial value for the property to be the empty string rather than . You would specify that as shown in the following code:\n\nIn C# 13, you can add validation or other logic in the accessor for a property using the keyword preview feature. The keyword accesses the compiler synthesized backing field for a property. It enables you to write a property accessor without explicitly declaring a separate backing field.\n\nThe keyword is a preview feature in C# 13. You must be using .NET 9 and set your element to in your project file in order to use the contextual keyword. You should be careful using the keyword feature in a class that has a field named . The new keyword shadows a field named in the scope of a property accessor. You can either change the name of the variable, or use the token to reference the identifier as . You can learn more by reading the feature specification for the keyword.\n\nThe preceding example allows a caller to create a using the default constructor, without setting the property. The property changed type to a nullable string. Beginning in C# 11, you can require callers to set a property:\n\nThe preceding code makes two changes to the class. First, the property declaration includes the modifier. That means any code that creates a new must set this property using an object initializer. Second, the constructor that takes a parameter has the System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SetsRequiredMembersAttribute attribute. This attribute informs the compiler that this constructor sets all members. Callers using this constructor aren't required to set properties with an object initializer.\n\nProperty accessors often consist of single-line statements. The accessors assign or return the result of an expression. You can implement these properties as expression-bodied members. Expression body definitions consist of the token followed by the expression to assign to or retrieve from the property.\n\nRead-only properties can implement the accessor as an expression-bodied member. The following example implements the read-only property as an expression-bodied member:\n\nThe property is a computed property. There's no backing field for . The property computes it each time.\n\nThe preceding examples showed read / write properties. You can also create read-only properties, or give different accessibility to the set and get accessors. Suppose that your class should only enable changing the value of the property from other methods in the class. You could give the set accessor accessibility instead of or :\n\nThe property can be read from any code, but it can be assigned only from code in the class.\n\nYou can add any restrictive access modifier to either the set or get accessors. An access modifier on an individual accessor must be more restrictive than the access of the property. The preceding code is legal because the property is , but the set accessor is . You couldn't declare a property with a accessor. Property declarations can also be declared , , , or, even .\n\nThere are two special access modifiers for accessors:\n• A accessor can have as its access modifier. That accessor can be called only from an object initializer or the type's constructors. It's more restrictive than on the accessor.\n• An automatically implemented property can declare a accessor without a accessor. In that case, the compiler allows the accessor to be called only from the type's constructors. It's more restrictive than the accessor on the accessor.\n\nModify the class so as follows:\n\nThe preceding example requires callers to use the constructor that includes the parameter. Callers can't use object initializers to assign a value to the property. To support initializers, you can make the accessor an accessor, as shown in the following code:\n\nThese modifiers are often used with the modifier to force proper initialization.\n\nYou can mix the concept of a computed property with a private field and create a cached evaluated property. For example, update the property so that the string formatting happens on the first access:\n\nThis implementation works because the and properties are readonly. People can change their name. Updating the and properties to allow accessors requires you to invalidate any cached value for . You modify the accessors of the and property so the field is calculated again:\n\nThis final version evaluates the property only when needed. The previously calculated version is used if valid. Otherwise, the calculation updates the cached value. Developers using this class don't need to know the details of the implementation. None of these internal changes affect the use of the Person object.\n\nBeginning with C# 13, you can create properties in classes. The implementing declaration for a property can't be an automatically implemented property. An automatically implemented property uses the same syntax as a declaring partial property declaration.\n\nProperties are a form of smart fields in a class or object. From outside the object, they appear like fields in the object. However, properties can be implemented using the full palette of C# functionality. You can provide validation, different accessibility, lazy evaluation, or any requirements your scenarios need.\n• Simple properties that require no custom accessor code can be implemented either as expression body definitions or as automatically implemented properties.\n• Properties enable a class to expose a public way of getting and setting values, while hiding implementation or verification code.\n• A get property accessor is used to return the property value, and a set property accessor is used to assign a new value. An init property accessor is used to assign a new value only during object construction. These accessors can have different access levels.

In this article, we will learn about the best coding practices every C# developer should know.\n\nThere are various naming conventions you should use when following best coding practices in C#.\n\nUsing consistent naming conventions across a codebase can make it easier for developers to understand and navigate the code, and can help prevent naming conflicts and confusion.\n\nThe following naming conventions are usually observed in C# programming.\n\nWhen to use Pascal case\n\nWhen naming a class, struct, method, property, or constant field, Pascal casing is usually preferred.\n\nWhen naming an interface, it is usually prefixed with the capital letter I. You can also use Pascal case when naming an interface.\n\nWhen to use Camel case\n\nCamel cases are used when naming method arguments, private fields, and local variables. Private fields are usually prefixed with _.\n\nUse meaningful names for classes, methods, and properties\n\nAlways use meaningful and self-explanatory names for your classes, methods, and properties. It is good practice to name properties, methods, and classes with what they do. This way, just by reading the name, you can easily know what exactly it does.\n\nAlways use meaningful and self-explanatory names for your LINQ query variables, as seen in the example below.\n\nHow to declare member variables and fields\n\nAlways declare all your member variables and fields at the top of a class. When fields are declared at the top of a class, it is easy to see all the variables that the class is using and understand the class's overall state.\n\nIt's also important to declare fields at the top of a class in C# because it makes the code more organized and readable, especially when working with large classes or when working with a team. This makes it easier for others to understand the code and make changes.\n\nWhen it comes to code layout, it is important to format and properly indent your code for readability and clean code organization.\n\nIt is good practice to write only one statement per line. For example:\n\nIt is good practice to start your comments with uppercase text and end with a period.\n\nWriting comments is helpful to the whole team. It makes code more readable, maintainable, and understandable. It is good practice to place comments on a new line, not at the end of your code. For example:\n\nHow to compare a value to an empty string\n\nInstead of \" \", try when comparing a value to an empty string. Using String.Empty improves code readability and makes it clear that the comparison is intended to be with an empty string. This makes it easier to understand and maintain the code in the future.\n\nUse exception handling to gracefully handle errors and exceptions. This helps prevent your code from crashing and makes it more robust. It is good practice to use a try-catch statement for most exception handling.\n\nUse and for better performance\n\nTo increase the performance of your application, it is good practice to use && instead of & and || instead of | when you perform comparisons, as shown in the following example.\n\nThis is because the and operators are known as \"short-circuit\" operators. This means that if the first operand of an operation is false, the second operand will not be evaluated because the overall expression must be false.\n\nSimilarly, if the first operand of an operation is true, the second operand will not be evaluated because the overall expression must be true.\n\nThis in turn increase the performance of your program.\n\nIt is best to limit your methods to a single functionality. Do not try to combine multiple functionalities of a class into a single method. This ensures code readability and helps you avoid writing \"spaghetti code\".\n\nUse enums instead of using numbers and strings to indicate discrete values. Enums provide a way to improve the quality of your code by making it more readable, type-safe, and efficient. They also provide a way to define a set of named integral constants.\n\nHow to compare string variables with user input\n\nIt is good practice to always convert string variables into uppercase or lowercase before comparing them with user input.\n\nThis ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive. This makes your code more readable and maintainable as it eliminates the need for case-handling logic.\n\nCoding conventions ensure readability and consistency within the team's and company’s codebase.\n\nThere are a lot of coding conventions in C# that help to ensure code quality. You can check the Microsoft .NET documentation to read more about coding conventions.\n\nI hope you learnt a lot through this tutorial."
