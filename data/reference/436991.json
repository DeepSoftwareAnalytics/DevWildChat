        "document": "This guide explains how to change your Odoo Admin Password from the graphical interface, as well as using the command line of your Linux server.\n\nThis is the password of the user with the ‘Administrator’ privileges. You specified it for your Admin user when you first accessed the Odoo graphical interface after a fresh installation.\n\nIn this article, we will be changing the Odoo Admin Password. Click here to learn how to change your Master Password instead. Alternatively, to change your Database Password, follow this link.\n\nIf you simply want to change the password to a different one (say, for extra security), then you can do it through the Admin Panel. It’s a simple process, but you have to know the old password.\n\nThe second scenario is when you don’t remember your password and can’t log in at all. Because you can’t change the password from the graphical interface, you will need to do it manually - from your Odoo server’s command line.\n\n1. Change Your Odoo Admin Password From the Admin Panel\n\nFirst of all, go to your Odoo Admin Panel and log in. Then, proceed to the ‘Preferences’ menu.\n\nIn the window that appears, click on the ‘Change password’ button. (On Odoo 14, you need to first switch to the \"Account Security\" tab)\n\nYou will see three input fields. Type in your old password, and then provide a new one (twice). Click on ‘Change password’ when you’re done.\n\nThat’s it. Now your Admin password is changed.\n\n2. Change Your Odoo Admin Password From the Command Line\n\nIn order to change the password from the command line, you will need to access your Odoo server first. Usually, the way to do that is to use SSH to connect to a remote server.\n\nThe process is fairly straightforward. We first need to generate a hashed (i.e. transformed and hard to read) version of the new password, and then change the user’s password value in the database.\n\nLet’s begin by hashing the new password. We will do it using the Python programming language in combination with the modules that are used in Odoo.\n\nOnce you’re in your server’s terminal, switch the current user to odoo:\n\nAfter that, activate a virtual environment that Odoo is using (basically, we will be able to access the same modules as Odoo):\n\nEncrypt the new password using the PBKDF2 SHA512 scheme and show the result:\n\nNote: change your_new_password to whatever you want your new password to be. The value should remain wrapped in single quotation marks.\n\nYou should see a long string of text that looks similar to this one:\n\nCopy (or write down) your unique text string. You will need it later.\n\nWhen you’re done, exit the Python shell.\n\nConnect to the PostgreSQL (Odoo’s database) shell to modify the database.\n\nIf you don't remember the name of your Odoo database (you set it when you created your Admin user), use the following command to list all the databases and accociated users.\n\nSearch for the odoo user and the associated database name. The latter is the name you need.\n\nOnce you know the database name, connect to the Odoo database:\n\nNote: change test to the actual name of your Odoo database.\n\nNow we need to change the password of the Admin user. If you don’t remember the user’s email value (which is used as the login), execute the following command to get a list of all user logins.\n\nFind your email in that list.\n\nFinally, change the password value of the Admin user to the newly generated one:\n\nNote: change your@email.com to your actual email value. Change new_hashed_password to that long string of text that you copied/wrote down earlier. Both values should remain wrapped in single quotation marks.\n\nCongratulations! You will now be able to log in to your Admin account with the new password.\n\nIf you are a SolaDrive customer and use one of our Odoo VPS Hosting services, you can simply ask our expert Odoo specialists to change your Admin Password for you. We are available 24/7 via chat or ticket and will take care of your request immediately."

        "link": "https://odoo.com/documentation/18.0/developer/reference/external_api.html",
        "document": "Odoo is usually extended internally via modules, but many of its features and all of its data are also available from the outside for external analysis or integration with various tools. Part of the Models API is easily available over XML-RPC and accessible from a variety of languages. Starting with PHP8, the XML-RPC extension may not be available by default. Check out the manual for the installation steps. Access to data via the external API is only available on Custom Odoo pricing plans. Access to the external API is not available on One App Free or Standard plans. For more information visit the Odoo pricing page or reach out to your Customer Success Manager.\n\nIf you already have an Odoo server installed, you can just use its parameters. For Odoo Online instances (<domain>.odoo.com), users are created without a local password (as a person you are logged in via the Odoo Online authentication system, not by the instance itself). To use XML-RPC on Odoo Online instances, you will need to set a password on the user account you want to use:\n• None Log in your instance with an administrator account.\n• None Click on the user you want to use for XML-RPC access.\n• None Set a New Password value then click Change Password. The server url is the instance’s domain (e.g. https://mycompany.odoo.com), the database name is the name of the instance (e.g. mycompany). The username is the configured user’s login as shown by the Change Password screen.\n\nOdoo has support for api keys and (depending on modules or settings) may require these keys to perform webservice operations. The way to use API Keys in your scripts is to simply replace your password by the key. The login remains in-use. You should store the API Key as carefully as the password as they essentially provide the same access to your user account (although they can not be used to log-in via the interface). In order to add a key to your account, simply go to your Preferences (or My Profile): then open the Account Security tab, and click New API Key: Input a description for the key, this description should be as clear and complete as possible: it is the only way you will have to identify your keys later and know whether you should remove them or keep them around. Click Generate Key, then copy the key provided. Store this key carefully: it is equivalent to your password, and just like your password the system will not be able to retrieve or show the key again later on. If you lose this key, you will have to create a new one (and probably delete the one you lost). Once you have keys configured on your account, they will appear above the New API Key button, and you will be able to delete them: A deleted API key can not be undeleted or re-set. You will have to generate a new key and update all the places where you used the old one.\n\nOdoo requires users of the API to be authenticated before they can query most data. The endpoint provides meta-calls which don’t require authentication, such as the authentication itself or fetching version information. To verify if the connection information is correct before trying to authenticate, the simplest call is to ask for the server’s version. The authentication itself is done through the function and returns a user identifier ( ) used in authenticated calls instead of the login.\n\ncan be used to inspect a model’s fields and check which ones seem to be of interest. Because it returns a large amount of meta-information (it is also used by client programs) it should be filtered before printing, the most interesting items for a human user are (the field’s label), (a help text if available) and (to know which values to expect, or to send when updating a record). \"The fiscal position will determine taxes and accounts used for the partner.\"\n\nBecause it is a very common task, Odoo provides a shortcut which, as its name suggests, is equivalent to a followed by a , but avoids having to perform two requests and keep ids around. Its arguments are similar to ’s, but it can also take a list of (like , if that list is not provided it will fetch all fields of matched records).\n\nProvides information about Odoo models via its various fields. the name of each model in the system whether the model was generated in Python code ( ) or by creating an record ( ) list of the model’s fields through a to ir.model.fields to the View architectures defined for the model relation to the Access Rights set on the model\n• None Query the system for installed models (as a precondition to operations on the model or to explore the system’s content).\n• None Get information about a specific model (generally by listing the fields associated with it).\n• None The must be provided and set to , otherwise the model will not be loaded.\n• None It is not possible to add new methods to a custom model, only fields.

        "document": "Odoo defines a user as someone who has access to a database to perform daily tasks. You can add as many users as you need and, in order to restrict the type of information each user can access, rules can be applied. Users and access rights can be added and changed at any point.\n\nGo to Settings ‣ Manage Users and click on Create. Fill in the form with the needed information. Under the tab choose the group within each application the user can have access to. The list of applications shown is based on the applications installed on the database. When you are done editing the page and have Saved it, an invitation email is automatically sent to the user. The user must click on it to accept the invitation and create a login. Remember that subscription prices follow the number of users. Refer to our pricing page for more information. With the developer mode activated, User Types can be selected. The Portal and Public options do not allow you to choose access rights. Members have specific ones (such as record rules and restricted menus) and usually do not belong to the usual Odoo groups.\n\nIt is possible to enable password resets directly from the login page.

        "document": "In this section, we will cover the essential steps of creating and managing user accounts in Odoo 16. Let’s dive in:\n\nCreating user accounts allows individuals to securely access your Odoo 16 system, personalize settings, and track their activities. It provides authenticated access and enables users to perform their tasks efficiently.\n• Log in to your Odoo 16 instance as an administrator or user with sufficient access rights.\n• Navigate to the “Settings” module and click on the “Manage Users” option.\n• Click on the “Create” button to start creating a new user.\n• Enter the user’s details, including username and email address. Under “Allowed companies” select which entities you want to give your user access to. You can also specify other optional information like the user’s language and time zone under the “Preferences” tab​.\n\nAfter everything is set and the page is saved, the new User will receive an automatic invitation email from Odoo which he then must accept to create a login.\n\nIn Odoo, users are categorized into different types based on their roles and access levels:\n• Internal Users: typically employees with access to various modules and features.\n• Portal Users: Customers or suppliers with limited access to relevant documents via the Portal\n• Public Users: Website access only, to publicly available features, such as browsing product catalogs or submitting contact forms\n\nBy assigning the appropriate user type in Odoo 16, you can ensure that individuals have the right level of access and functionality tailored to their specific roles and needs.\n\nWith the “Related Partner” field you can associate a user with a specific partner record, such as a customer or supplier. This connection enables seamless integration and collaboration across different modules in Odoo, ensuring efficient communication and access to associated records.\n\nFor example, If you create a new contact in Odoo’s contact app for a new customer to who you want to give access to your customer portal, you can do so by simple click on the Contact form, under “Action” > “Grant portal access”\n\nIn the pop-up window that opens click “Grant Access” and “Close”. Now go back to “Settings” > “Companies & Users” > “Users“. Here you will see now that a new Portal User was automatically created and an email invitation for login creation was already sent.\n\nOdoo allows you to define user access rights with laser precision. In the “Access Rights” tab of the user form, you can conveniently select the exact role and access permission for each of your installed applications.\n\nEasily Enable Password Resets from Login Page – To allow your users password resets directly from the login page, follow these steps:\n\nTo send password reset instructions to users in Odoo, follow these simple steps:\n• Locate the right user from the list and open their user form.\n• Within the user form, click on the “Send Password Reset Instructions” option.\n\nAn automatic email will be dispatched to the user, containing comprehensive instructions on how to reset their password. The email will also include a convenient link that redirects the user to an Odoo login page specifically designed for password resetting.\n\nTo change a user’s password in Odoo, follow these simple steps:\n• Choose the user for whom you wish to modify the password to access their user form.\n• Click on the “Action” button and select “Change Password“\n• Enter the desired new password and confirm the change by clicking on “Change Password“\n\nthis change only affects the user’s local password within your Odoo system and does not impact their odoo.com account. If you need to change the password for their odoo.com account, it is recommended to send the password reset instructions.\n\nAfter clicking on “Change Password“, you will be redirected to an Odoo login page where you can reaccess your database using the newly updated password.\n\nThis feature is especially useful if your organization consists of multiple entities that should all be managed from one central system. Under the “Access Right” tab of your user forms, you have the “Allowed Companies” field which allows you to define which of the multiple company databases a user can access. You can select one, or multiple.\n\nUser groups in Odoo 16 simplify access control and permissions management. They allow you to group users based on their roles or departments, providing efficient control over access to modules, features, and data. By assigning users to groups, you can easily manage permissions for multiple users at once, ensuring appropriate access and enhancing data security within your Odoo 16 system.\n\nTo be able to access User groups in your Odoo 16 user face, activate the developer mode, then go to “Settings” > “Users & Companies” > “Groups“\n\nHere you can see an overview of all your different groups and group types, create new ones or configure existing ones. To do the latter, select a specific group and click on it.\n\nEach Access Group can be precisely configured through a multitude of Tabs and allows you to define exact rules to models within each of your Odoo apps. For starters, under “Users” you can see a list of all your Users currently in this group.\n\nWhen a user is added to an application access group with “inherited” settings in Odoo, it means they are automatically added to other related groups as well. For instance, if a user has access to the “Employees / Administrator” group, they will also have access to the “Fleet / Administrator” and “Employees / Officer: Manage all employees” groups. This simplifies user management by ensuring that permissions and access rights cascade down through related groups, providing seamless access control across multiple functionalities.\n\nThe Menus tab in Odoo allows you to specify the menus or models that a user can access. By configuring this tab, you control which sections and features of the system are available to the user. It serves as a way to customize the user’s interface and determine their level of access to different functionalities within Odoo.\n\nAccess Rights rules in Odoo serve as the first level of rights for controlling user permissions. Each rule corresponds to a specific object or model within the system. By enabling the appropriate options, you can determine the user’s access level for that particular object:\n• Read: Allows the user to view the values of the object but not modify them.\n• Write: Grants the user permission to edit the values of the object.\n• Create: Permits the user to create new values or records for that object.\n• Delete: Enables the user to remove or delete values associated with the object.\n\nThese options provide flexibility in defining the user’s level of access and control over individual objects or models within Odoo.\n\nRecord Rules in Odoo serve as an additional layer for defining editing and visibility rules, to overwrite or refine the Access Rights settings. They control access to records within a model and which records can be accessed by which users. When configuring a record rule, you can choose from options like Read, Write, Create, and Delete to specify the permissions for values associated with that rule. This provides a more granular control over user access and actions on specific records within the system.\n\nTo understand this better, let’s look at a example:\n\nIn the User Group “Sales / Own documents” you can see a variety of Records Rules set. The “Personal” rules restrict this group to accessing only their own sales orders and any unassigned orders. Additionally, they enjoy complete access to all records of other models.\n\nIn contrast, the “all documents” group is granted access to all records using the domain [(1,’=’,1)] which is always true.\n\nAs a result, the “Sales > Administrator” group doesn’t require additional access privileges since it inherits full access from the “All Documents” group."

Select both Contacts, then choose the MERGE action. You will then pick the Destination Contact that all documents linked to both contacts will end up, and the contact you don't select will be deleted after the merge.\n\n\n\nContacts are promoted to become a Vendor and/or a Customer based on Invoices and/or Bills being created for them. All contacts can always be found from all Menus that work with Contacts - such as any Customer and any Vendor Menu. You just need to clear the \"Customer Invoices\" and/or \"Vendor Bills\" filters to see them.\n\n\n\nWhen archiving the Employee, the Contact is not archived. When archiving a User, the Contact is not archived. You can archive the Contacts if/when you need to but generally they would remain because they are linked to other documents in Odoo (and once a Contact is linked to something else, you can not delete it).\n\n\n\nSince you cannot create two Users with the same email address, you will not run into a situation where you accidentally create the User twice.\n\n\n\nYou can create the User 'inline' when creating the Employee. This involves entering the new User name in the selection field on the HR Settings tab of the Employee and creating the User BEFORE saving the Employee. In this case there is no duplicate Contact record created.\n\n\n\nThe best practice would be to create Users First, then Employees that link to them - either one at a time, linking them to the User during creation - or via an import that links them to the related User record during import. This results in a single Contact record being created (when the User is created) instead of a separate Contact record when the Employee is created without being linked to a User (or using the CREATE USER action). Since this is the Contact record created by the User, edits to the name are synchronized between Contact and User."

        "document": "You'll notice these terms used in reference to Odoo. It's very important to know the difference. A User (or Database User) has been granted permission to access one or more backend applications of Odoo, such as an administrator or employee. Odoo charges per-seat for every added user. A Contact (or Partner) is an entry in the Contacts application who does not have access to the backend applications, such as a customer or job applicant. There is no limit to the number of contacts that can be added to the database.\n\nThis will bring up the Default User Template where you can select the default permissions for default user. Note that this template is shown as ; it can, and is, still applied to new users, it's just not listed as an active user. This prevents it from being accidentally modified or removed, and shall be left as 'archived'. There will be options for each app you have installed to the database which require permissions. Not all the permissions are visible on this screenshot, so please use the scroll bar to navigate through all your available options.\n• None Internal User: This is a user who has access to the backend of odoo. This type of user will generate a contact card and can also generate an employee card if need be since this type of user generally works for the company.\n• None Portal: This type of user is usually a customer with portal access. They can interact with your website, make purchases and see their own documents associated with purchases or sales with the company.\n• None Public: This user is an anonymous website visitor, which is for the general public to see your website. Essentially, everyone is a public user until an account for portal access is created for them. Once you've made your changes, click in the breadcrumbs to navigate to the previous page.\n\nApps will come preloaded with certain access rights enabled. Whether your user is designated a User or Admin, that app will determine the amount of editing power available to them. Therefore, when adding an app, you may have to alter a user's permissions to grant them management of database items. To fine-tune a user's access, see their user configuration. Permission options are listed in the drop-down in lowest to highest permissions. Those permissions are listed from lowest level to to the highest. Notice the drop-down lists begin with a 'blank' option. Choosing a 'blank' generally restricts a user from viewing and accessing a related feature.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThere are two methods in which to add a Database User. To get started, navigate to the Settings app. In the Settings App, you must first navigate to you list of users, either from General Settings, under Users, click , or from the Users & Companies > menu. Once there, click Create to open the New User form. Enter the Name and Email Address for the new user. The and abs will pre-fill from the Default User Template and can be modified as needed. When you're done, click to save manually. At any point, you may click to, you guessed it, send the user an invitation email. From General Settings, under Users, you'll see the Invite New Users section to the left. Enter the email address for the new user, then click Invite. You will also notice that underneath, you will see the list of Pending Invitations. These are accounts that have not been confirmed yet by the user. The user will get an email inviting them to connect; they'll need to accept the invitation from this email. Doing so will take them to the Odoo database where they'll create their own password. This will also remove them from the Pending Invitations list as seen in the above image. There are two ways a user can reset their password: Option 1: If at any point the user forget their password, you can click on the button on the user record itself. Option 2: This option is only available if the options Password Reset is enabled in Settings app, under General Settings in the Permissions section. A user will then be able to reset their own password by clicking on the Sign In form. Both options will send an email to the user prompting them to click Change Password to get it updated. This link will take them to the password reset form on the website to change their password. You will notice that the user will only have the ability to change their password. Their email and name will remain uneditable. Once they complete the form, they will click CONFIRM.\n\n\n\n\n\n In the \n\n\n\n These settings are also pulled from the Default User Template and you can change them here. The user will have access to this tab to configure them, as well.\n• None Language: Select the user's preferred language. These are preconfigured in Odoo and may only have one option.\n• None TImezone: It's important that the timezone is set appropriately for the user or their calendar will not sync correctly with other users' and apps.\n• None Handle by Emails: This setting will send all Odoo communication via email to the user's email address.\n• None Handle in Odoo: This setting will send all Odoo communication to the Odoo inbox.\n• None Home Actio : (available in debug mode) If specified, this action will be opened by default, in addition to the standard menu when the user logs in.\n\n Debug Mode): This option allows you to set the preferences for Odoobot within your database. Email Signature: This is the default signature that will be used when sending email correspondence through Odoo. Karma: If enabled, users can earn Karma from eLearning courses, their Karma will display here.\n• None Digital Signatures: Set and store a digital version of a users signature and initials, for use in signing official documents.\n• None Default Warehouse: This allows each user to have a specific warehouse set by default in the inventory application. This tab only appears once the user template is saved! Two-Factor Authentication: This option will toggle a double authentication for this user. In other words, only authorized devices will be able to access your account. To start, click the toggle button. Type in this user's password in order to confirm that this is being toggled for the account holder. This will then give you a QR code to scan with your mobile device using one of their suggested authenticator apps. Follow the directions on their popup modal, until you are given a six-digit verification code, then click Activate."
