        "document": "This page containswhich are not marked for translation.\n\nThis is the documentation page for KDE Connect. If you are developing, debugging, or building a release of KDE Connect, please refer to the community page.\n\nKDE Connect has two parts: the desktop program and the phone app.\n\nKDE Connect is a project that enables all your devices to communicate with each other. Here's a few things KDE Connect can do:\n• Receive your phone notifications on your desktop computer and reply to messages\n• Control music playing on your desktop from your phone\n• Use your phone as a remote control for your desktop\n• Run predefined commands on your PC from connected devices. See the list of example commands for more details.\n• Check your phone's battery level from the desktop\n• Ring your phone to help find it\n• Browse your phone from your desktop\n• Control the desktop's volume using your phone\n\nYou will most likely find the KDE Connect desktop component as a package in your distribution's repos. If not, you can ask them to package it.\n\nDespite common misconception, you can use KDE Connect on all desktop environments. Since most of the developers are using Plasma, it may occur that a feature is broken or inaccessible on other desktop environments. In this case, please file a bug report.\n\nThere are multiple ways to enhance the KDE Connect experience on non-Plasma desktops. If you are a GNOME user you might prefer GSConnect, a GNOME shell extension. For desktops with AppIndicator support (Budgie, Cinnamon, LXDE, Pantheon, Unity), KDE Connect already comes with the kdeconnect-indicator binary, which can be set to autostart in each environment.\n\nThe app for Android can be found in both the Google Play Store and the free and open store F-Droid.\n\nThe app for iOS can be found in Apple's proprietary App Store. Additionally, a pre-release, testing version of KDE Connect can be downloaded from TestFlight. Please see the iOS README for important data disclosure information, known limitations, and bug reporting information.\n\nKDE Connect is also available for SailfishOS via sailfish-connect and we are working on bringing it to other Linux-based phones (Plasma Mobile, PostmarketOS etc.)\n\nSee KDE Connect download page for installation links for other platforms (including Windows and macOS).\n\nFirst, you need to open KDE Connect on your computer and phone. You should now be able to see in each screen the name of the device you wish to pair with. If it's not working, make sure that the two devices are connected to the same network and that there isn't any firewall blocking the two devices from seeing each other. See the troubleshooting section.\n\nYou can now request pairing in one of the two devices. The other device will show a prompt asking to accept the pairing request. Confirm it and that's it! Your devices are now paired.\n\nWhile a typical configuration might include one computer and one phone, it's also possible to pair two computers instead.\n\nIn recent versions (for example v24.08.1) bluetooth connectivity has been enabled by default. To use this, you must first bluetooth pair your computer and phone.\n\nMake sure your phone is visible to pairing and it will appear, once appeared click pair:\n\nIt will pop up with a PIN to be confirmed on both the computer and the phone:\n\nClick matches on the desktop and pair on Android\n\nIt will then be connected correctly:\n\nOnce this has been achieved open the KDE Connect on Android and enable bluetooth\n\nOn the \"Add new devices\" page, the computer should appear and the pairing process can be followed as usual. Refreshing this view can force the phone to attempt to rediscover. This may take some time to appear, both Android and Bluez seem to implement quite a lot of caching and this can delay how long it takes to be detected.\n\nPlasma Browser Integration makes KDE Connect even more powerful. It allows you to control content from e.g. Youtube or Netflix from your phone and send browser tabs to your phone. Despite the name, it can also be used on non-Plasma desktops.\n\nYou can only change the name of your device on the device itself. So if you want to change the name of your computer then you must use the desktop program and if you want to change the name of your phone or tablet you must make the change in the KDE Connect app. Once a device is renamed, it will automatically sync with all other connected devices.\n\nThere may be a variety of reasons for using KDE Connect with a VPN. Maybe you have left home and want to run a command, or maybe you’re on a public wifi network where your devices aren’t allowed to communicate and you want to use the remote control to give a presentation.\n\nIf you have your own server with a public-facing IP address, you can set up OpenVPN yourself. It is not the easiest piece of software to set up, but by following a setup tutorial such as this one, you should be able to manage.\n\nIn order to allow UDP broadcast packets, which are what KDE Connect uses to automatically discover two devices, OpenVPN needs to be set up for bridging (TAP device). If you use a tun device, you can still manually connect by IP address.\n\nIf you want to rent a pre-configured OpenVPN service rather than set up your own, it should work, but the same considerations about the server settings need to be taken into account.\n\nOnce the server is running, you can use the official OpenVPN client to connect the desktop to the server. There is no official OpenVPN client for Android, but the OpenVPN for Android client works well: openvpn\n\nOnce both devices are connected, test that they are able to communicate over the VPN by trying to do a network ping between them.\n\nIf your OpenVPN instance is set up for bridging, KDE Connect should work just like on a local network.\n\nIf you are using OpenVPN with a tun device, you will have to manually add your devices by IP. Then, once you connect to the VPN, KDE Connect should automatically detect your device and either connect or be ready for pairing!\n\n\"Show your phone battery next to your computer battery.\"\n\nBy enabling this, the KDE Connect widget on your panel tray will display your phone's battery.\n\nWith this, you can simply copy text from your computer and it will be immediately available to paste on your phone, and vice-versa. This does not work with images though.\n\nAndroid 10 prevents apps from accessing the clipboard to prevent malicious apps from accessing your data. This makes the clipboard plugin in KDE Connect uncomfortable to use.\n\nOn Android 14, there's a tile in the pull-down menu called \"Send clipboard\", that can be moved to a convenient slot (e.g. in the partial pull-down section).\n\nIf you are rooted, you can use a Magisk module to remove this restriction.\n\nIf you have a build containing commit edc655da5ac1eb5c3027c8556cc62037a1d4c5ac, you can enable the READ_LOGS permission in order to enable a workaround to clipboard sync.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nWith log reading enabled, KDE Connect watches its own log. If it sees a line indicating that it has been denied access to read the clipboard, it pops up an invisible window to the foreground, grabs the clipboard, and closes the window.\n\nThis plugin silently synchronizes contacts, in vcard format, from your phone to your desktop.\n\nAs of this writing, the synchronization is one-way, with data being sent from the Android implementation to the desktop, to be consumed by any application which uses the KPeople library with the KPeopleVCard plugin, such as the KDE Connect SMS app.\n\nOn non-Windows platforms, contact cards are written to QStandardPaths::writableLocation(QStandardPaths::GenericDataLocation) + \"/kpeoplevcard\". This might be configured differently by your system, but normally resolves to ~/.local/share/kpeoplevcard.\n\nOn Windows, the path resolves to %LocalAppData%.\n\n\"Inhibit the screensaver when the device is connected.\"\n\nThis makes sure that your screensaver will not run while your device is connected.\n\nWith this feature, you can control your music and videos remotely, with pause/play, previous/next, 5 s before/later. You can also change which media player to control, in addition to application and system volume.\n\nPause music/videos during a call. This feature can be powerful when combined with Plasma Browser Integration. For example, when you are listening to some music on Peertube or Youtube, the video will be paused whenever you receive a call.\n\nYou can configure this option to pause only when you pick up your phone or directly when your phone starts to ring. You can also decide if you want to only pause the media player or/and mute the system sound.\n\nThis serves to test your connection to a given device. Once selected, a \"Ping!\" will appear as a notification on your receiving device.\n\nOn your desktop, you can send a ping through the KDE Connect settings or through the widget on the tray.\n\nOn your phone, you can send a ping through the upper right hamburger menu on the KDE Connect app.\n\n\"Show your phone notifications on your computer and keep them in sync.\"\n\nThis keeps you in touch with what happens on your phone! Any notifications you receive on your phone will be shown in your computer. Some notifications, such as those of Instant Messengers (IM) like Telegram can be replied on the fly through the computer notification itself.\n\nThis allows you to access your phone storage! When enabled, a device will appear in Dolphin with which you can navigate your external storage.\n\n\"Find your lost phone by making it play an alarm sound.\"\n\nThis also serves to test your connection to a given device, and by ringing your phone remotely, you can quickly find its location!\n\nWith KDE Connect, you can run predefined commands on your computer by pressing buttons on your phone! Instructions on how to add a command are shown in userbase. A set of useful commands can also be found here. Some sample commands, such as suspend and lock screen, are also available.\n\nIf your device supports Device Controls (Android 11+), KDE Connect will display configured commands there. You can then quickly control your remote device, such as locking the screen. See Google's documentation for more description of device controls: https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/device-control\n\n\"Broadcast this computer's notifications, so they can be shown on other devices.\"\n\nThis is pretty self-explanatory: notifications from your computer will show up on your phone.\n\nYou can configure if you want to send the notification description, the icons pertaining to the application and persistent or very important notifications. This keeps you in touch with what happens on your computer! Any notifications you receive on your computer will be shown in your phone.\n\nOn Android 15+, \"sensitive\" notification content is hidden by the system when passed to applications. Due to this limitation, KDE Connect will show something like \"Sensitive notification content hidden\" instead of the real content.\n\nKDE Connect can be granted the RECEIVE_SENSITIVE_NOTIFICATIONS permission, at which point sensitive notification content will be delivered normally. This may not work on all manufacturer's devices.\n• Connect the phone over ADB, either with USB or wireless ADB.\n\nIn the notification settings for the app you want to send unrestricted notifications, disable \"Enhanced notifications\" which will remove this restriction.\n\nNote that this will disable all enhanced notification functionality, such as being able to reply to messages from notifications, etc.\n\nThis integrates your desktop and your browser so that you can right-click on files or links and send it immediately to your phone!\n\nFiles show the right-click option \"Send to phone via KDEConnect\" and will send the file directly, showing it among your notifications.\n\nLinks show the right-click option \"Open on phone\" and will automatically open your phone's default browser on the chosen website. Really handy!\n\nWhen receiving files from your phone into your computer, they will go to your Downloads folder by default. If you wish, you can change that too.\n\nWhenever you get a call on your phone, a notification telling you which number is calling appears. Paired with \"Pause media during calls\", you'll surely be able to answer readily and never lose a call!\n\n\"Use your phone as a touchpad and keyboard.\"\n\nWith this enabled, by going to your phone app and selecting Remote input, a touch screen will immediately be available for you to control your computer mouse, similarly to a touchpad. One touch equals one click.\n\nThe keyboard icon in the upper right allows you to type on your phone and see the result on your computer too.\n\nIf you press the hamburger menu right by its side, you'll be able to send right and middle clicks.\n\nIt is possible to control presentations using the previous/next slide button. When the device is locked, you can use the volume up/down button to do that. You can also highlight something using the laserpointer. Just move your phone and the blue circle will follow! Using the hamburger menu, you can toggle fullscreen (F5) or quit the presentation (Esc).\n\nFrom time to time, Google will require video submissions to prove that we use permissions in ways which are allowed by Play Store policies. Those videos are gathered here for future reference, but also because they provide nice tutorials of how to use certain features, and are also useful to demonstrate permissions usage to a wider audience.\n\nIn order to be a fake input device, Android requires that we take the Accessibility permission. The mouse receiver plugin is demonstrated in the following video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQ-Oubt4Rks\n\nThis video demonstrates several KDE Connect features, in particular it demonstrates how KDE Connect uses certain privacy-impacting permissions, such as the SMS permissions. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGHzXpX0vtk\n\nMissing or limited features on some platforms\n\nSome platforms are missing some features due to technical limitations or other reasons.\n• Keeping connection alive when app is not on-screen\n\nOne way - only from iOS to desktop\n• Shared clipboard (limited, need to tap \"push clipboard\" on the app to push clipboard to the PC)\n\nOne way - only from Android to desktop\n\nOne way - only from desktop to Android\n• SMS (retrieve from phone and dispatch send requests to phone)\n\nI have two devices running KDE Connect on the same network, but they can't see each other\n\nKDE Connect uses dynamic ports in the range 1714-1764 for UDP and TCP. So if you are behind a firewall, make sure to open this port range for both TCP and UDP. Otherwise, make sure your network is not blocking UDP broadcast packets.\n\nCheck that the process is listening on the network:\n\nYou also get lots of Connection refused, but you need 1 “succeeded”\n\nIf the network connection is not the problem, you might try starting from a clean configuration again:\n\nIf your firewall is ufw, you can open the necessary ports with:\n\nIf your firewall is firewalld, you can open the necessary ports with:\n\nMake sure you choose the \"Permanent\" Configuration: option in the drop-down menu at the top, otherwise rebooting will discard your settings changes.\n\nIf your firewall is iptables, you can open the necessary ports with:\n\nKDE Connect crashes or restarts when trying to pair with another device\n\nSometimes, a corrupt config file may cause KDE Connect to crash when trying to pair with a device. In that case, deleting the config ~/.config/kdeconnect might help.\n\nIf the KDE Connect Android app crashes, you might be able to get more information about the crash by using adb logcat.\n\nSet up ADB using the official instructions\n\nThe following command should list all information relevant to your crash. Run adb logcat *before* triggering the crash.\n\nYes, you can pass the command line argument to the daemon (eg: )\n\nGSConnect is an independent project which implements the KDE Connect protocol into GNOME and uses the same Android app. If you are running GSConnect, please visit that project's GitHub page first for support. If you and the GSConnect team determine the issue is the Android app or protocol, feel free to report those in the KDE Connect bug tracker.\n\nCheck the logs for KDE Connect; a normal set of logs looks like:\n\nThe logs can usually be read with journalctl:\n\nand should contain several mentions of bluetooth. If there is a log like:\n\nthen the daemon was started when bluetooth was disabled and will need to be restarted until a release including https://invent.kde.org/mintsoft/kdeconnect-kde/-/commit/251ea971c5f3639a84f56bfb22237f93b4f817d2 is released.\n\nIf everything looks correct from the logging perspective then it is worth confirming that the bluetooth interface has had the service uuid added to it (this is what the client application will connect to). If you run there will be a list of UUIDs on the interface, and it should include\n\nIf it does not, then there is a problem registering the UUID on the interface and you should restart kdeconnectd and check the logs etc for information.\n\nMy problem is not in this list :(\n\nIn case you find a bug and want to report it, you can do so in the KDE bug tracker."

It hasn't yet been completely tested on MacOS, contributions and feedback are welcome!\n\nIt should work, but no promises :)\n\nKDE Connect consists of a UI-agnostic \"core\" library that exposes a series of DBus interfaces, and several UI components that consume these DBus interfaces. This way, new UI components can be added to integrate better with specific platforms or desktops, without having to reimplement the protocol or any of the internals. The core KDE Connect library is also divided into 4 big blocks:\n• LinkProviders: Are in charge of discovering other KDE Connect-enabled devices in the network and establishing a Link to them.\n• Devices: Represent a remote device, abstracting the specific Link that is being used to reach it.\n• NetworkPackets: JSON-serializable and self-contained pieces of information to be sent by the plugins between devices.\n• Plugins: Independent pieces of code that implement a specific feature. Plugins will use NetworkPackets to exchange information through the network with other Plugins on a remote Device.\n\nThe basic structure of a NetworkPacket is the following:\n\nThe content of the section is defined by each Plugin. Hence, only the emitter and receiver plugins of a given packet type need agree on the contents of the body.\n\nNetworkPackets can also have binary data attached that can't be serialized to JSON. In this case, two new fields will be added:\n\n: The size of the file, or -1 if it is a stream without known size. : Another JSON object where the specific Link can add information so the Link in the remote end can establish a connection and receive the payload (eg: IP and port in a local network). It's up to the Link implementation to decide how to use this field.\n\nTo contribute patches, use KDE Connect's GitLab. There you can also find a task list with stuff to do and links to other relevant resources. It is a good idea to also subscribe to the KDE Connect mailing list. We can also be reached on IRC at #kdeconnect on irc.libera.chat or on Telegram, contributions and feedback are warmly welcomed.\n\nFor bug reporting, please use KDE's Bugzilla. Please do not use the issue tracker in GitLab since we want to keep everything in one place.\n\nPlease know that all translations for all KDE apps are handled by the localization team. If you would like to submit a translation, that should be done by working with the proper team for that language.\n\nIf you are reading this from Github, you should know that this is just a mirror of the KDE Project repo."

The only way I can currently pair the phone and computer is by connecting my phone via USB, enabling USB tethering, and connecting my Windows device to the network through my phone. However, as soon as I disconnect my phone from the USB cable, KDE says it's become unreachable. I'm usually hooked up to my network using an ethernet connection, so this workaround is far from ideal.

Otherwise, make sure your network is not blocking UDP broadcast packets. \"\n\n\n\nStrange thing is, I had these ports open....\n\nWell, have disabled the firewall completely, configured KDE Connect and enabled the firewall again.\n\nNow the connection is established.\n\nI just dunno why it did not work despitec the ports were open....\n\nCan confirm that having firewall (UFW) enabled, even with the 1714-1764 port range open for both TCP and UDP, the devices don't pair. In my case, the smartphone wouldn't see the computer, while the computer saw the phone, but wouldn't pair.\n\nAs soon as UFW was disabled, the smartphone saw the computer and they paired normally.\n\nRe-enabling UFW after the initial setup did not break connection.\n\nThis is true for both KDE Connect on KDE and for GSConnect on Gnome. Maybe in other environments too.\n\nCan't connect phone (Android 9) to laptop (Ubuntu-18.04) with indicator-kde\n\nFirewall is not enabled (sudo ufw status ==> Status: inactive)\n\nThe laptop is on a LAN. tried setting its IP in the phone app - didn't help\n\nSwitched the laptop to WIFI (the same network as the phone) - didn't work as well\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOpen gufw from app launcher\n\nGo to the Rules tab\n\nClick the [+] button to add a new rule\n\nSelect the direction \"Both\"\n\nSelect category \"Network:\n\nSelect Application \"KDE connect\"\n\nClick \"Add\"\n\n\n\nProblem solved. Working fine. I confirm that this issue can be solved using,Open gufw from app launcherGo to the Rules tabClick the [+] button to add a new ruleSelect the direction \"Both\"Select category \"Network:Select Application \"KDE connect\"Click \"Add\"Problem solved. Working fine."

        "document": "I installed KDE Connect yesterday. Used it last night with no problems. Today I set it up the same way and do all the same things. Thought I’d share a bigger batch of files from my iPhone to my PC. At first it was slow and kept stalling. I cancelled the transfer, closed the app (on my phone) and program (on my PC) and went to eat some food. Came back and tried again. This time, it won’t initiate a file transfer at all. Not even for a single file. If I click on one to send, the app makes this error-type beeping sound and does nothing. I tried shutting down the programs and restarting them. No dice. It just won’t send files anymore. Any ideas why this is happening or what I can try?\n\nThere is the ping feature in kdeconnect, does that work to indicate you even have network traffic or connecting at all during the times showing problems? I’d check your wifi isn’t being spotty or not connecting at all. If nothing else, restart kdeconnectd (killall -9 kdeconnectd && /usr/lib/kdeconnectd 2>&1 &) and see if it just got hung up. Check also journalctl -f logs to see if anything interesting there.\n\nUpdate: this is still a significant issue for me. KDE Connect constantly fails while attempting to send files. Right now I sent a handful of files and it’s been stuck at 99% for about 10 minutes and just can’t seem to send that last 0.8MB. But the main issue is that it keeps losing the connection between my phone and PC. Often when that happens, I have to reboot my phone to make KDE Connect work again. Every day I manage, through great effort and frustration, to send a few files. At this rate, it will take months to send the 4GB of files I need copied off my phone. I’m grateful that KDE Connect exists as a tool, otherwise I would have no way of backing up my music at all, but there’s got to be a way to make it work better for me. I am indeed able to ping, when the devices are connected. journalctl -f revealed nothing that I found interesting, but I know very little about modern computers. My spotty wifi may be an issue. I am trying to get that diagnosed on the Ubuntu forums."
