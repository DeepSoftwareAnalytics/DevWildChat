        "document": "Communication theory is a proposed description of communication phenomena, the relationships among them, a storyline describing these relationships, and an argument for these three elements. Communication theory provides a way of talking about and analyzing key events, processes, and commitments that together form communication. Theory can be seen as a way to map the world and make it navigable; communication theory gives us tools to answer empirical, conceptual, or practical communication questions.[1]\n\nCommunication is defined in both commonsense and specialized ways. Communication theory emphasizes its symbolic and social process aspects as seen from two perspectives—as exchange of information (the transmission perspective), and as work done to connect and thus enable that exchange (the ritual perspective).[2]\n\nSociolinguistic research in the 1950s and 1960s demonstrated that the level to which people change their formality of their language depends on the social context that they are in. This had been explained in terms of social norms that dictated language use. The way that we use language differs from person to person.[3]\n\nCommunication theories have emerged from multiple historical points of origin, including classical traditions of oratory and rhetoric, Enlightenment-era conceptions of society and the mind, and post-World War II efforts to understand propaganda and relationships between media and society.[4][5][6] Prominent historical and modern foundational communication theorists include Kurt Lewin, Harold Lasswell, Paul Lazarsfeld, Carl Hovland, James Carey, Elihu Katz, Kenneth Burke, John Dewey, Jurgen Habermas, Marshall McLuhan, Theodor Adorno, Antonio Gramsci, Jean-Luc Nancy, Robert E. Park, George Herbert Mead, Joseph Walther, Claude Shannon,Stuart Hall and Harold Innis–although some of these theorists may not explicitly associate themselves with communication as a discipline or field of study.[4][6][7][8]\n\nOne key activity in communication theory is the development of models and concepts used to describe communication. In the Linear Model, communication works in one direction: a sender encodes some message and sends it through a channel for a receiver to decode. In comparison, the Interactional Model of communication is bidirectional. People send and receive messages in a cooperative fashion as they continuously encode and decode information. The Transactional Model assumes that information is sent and received simultaneously through a noisy channel, and further considers a frame of reference or experience each person brings to the interaction.[9]\n\nSome of the basic elements of communication studied in communication theory are:[10]\n• Source: Shannon calls this element the \"information source\", which \"produces a message or sequence of messages to be communicated to the receiving terminal.\" 11\n• Sender: Shannon calls this element the \"transmitter\", which \"operates on the message in some way to produce a signal suitable for transmission over the channel.\" 11 In Aristotle, this element is the \"speaker\" (orator). 12\n• Channel: For Shannon, the channel is \"merely the medium used to transmit the signal from transmitter to receiver.\" 11\n• Receiver: For Shannon, the receiver \"performs the inverse operation of that done by the transmitter, reconstructing the message from the signal.\" 11\n• Destination: For Shannon, the destination is \"the person (or thing) for whom the message is intended\". 11\n• Message: from Latin mittere, \"to send\". The message is a concept, information, communication, or statement that is sent in a verbal, written, recorded, or visual form to the recipient.\n\nCommunication theories vary substantially in their epistemology, and articulating this philosophical commitment is part of the theorizing process.[1] Although the various epistemic positions used in communication theories can vary, one categorization scheme distinguishes among interpretive empirical, metric empirical or post-positivist, rhetorical, and critical epistemologies.[13] Communication theories may also fall within or vary by distinct domains of interest, including information theory, rhetoric and speech, interpersonal communication, organizational communication, sociocultural communication, political communication, computer-mediated communication, and critical perspectives on media and communication.\n\nInterpretive empirical epistemology or interpretivism seeks to develop subjective insight and understanding of communication phenomena through the grounded study of local interactions. When developing or applying an interpretivist theory, the researcher themself is a vital instrument. Theories characteristic of this epistemology include structuration and symbolic interactionism, and frequently associated methods include discourse analysis and ethnography.[13]\n\nA metric empirical or post-positivist epistemology takes an axiomatic and sometimes causal view of phenomena, developing evidence about association or making predictions, and using methods oriented to measurement of communication phenomena.[13] Post-positivist theories are generally evaluated by their accuracy, consistency, fruitfulness, and parsimoniousness.[1] Theories characteristic of a post-positivist epistemology may originate from a wide range of perspectives, including pragmatist, behaviorist, cognitivist, structuralist, or functionalist.[14][13] Although post-positivist work may be qualitative or quantitative, statistical analysis is a common form of evidence and scholars taking this approach often seek to develop results that can be reproduced by others.\n\nA rhetorical epistemology lays out a formal, logical, and global view of phenomena with particular concern for persuasion through speech. A rhetorical epistemology often draws from Greco-Roman foundations such as the works of Aristotle and Cicero although recent work also draws from Michel Foucault, Kenneth Burke, Marxism, second-wave feminism, and cultural studies.[13] Rhetoric has changed overtime. Fields of rhetoric and composition have grown to become more interested in alternative types of rhetoric.[15]\n\nA critical epistemology is explicitly political and intentional with respect to its standpoint, articulating an ideology and criticizing phenomena with respect to this ideology. A critical epistemology is driven by its values and oriented to social and political change. Communication theories associated with this epistemology include deconstructionism, cultural Marxism, third-wave feminism, and resistance studies.[13]\n\nDuring the mid-1970's, presiding paradigm had passed in regards to the development in communication. More specifically the increase in a participatory approach which challenged studies like diffusionism which had dominated the 1950s.[16] There is no valid reason for studying people as an aggregation of specific individuals that have their social experience unified and cancelled out with the means of allowing only the attributes of socio-economic status, age and sex, representative of them except by assuming that the audience is a mass.[17]\n\nApproaches to theory also vary by perspective or subdiscipline. The communication theory as a field model proposed by Robert Craig has been an influential approach to breaking down the field of communication theory into perspectives, each with its own strengths, weaknesses, and trade-offs.\n\nIn information theory, communication theories examine the technical process of information exchange while typically using mathematics. [11] This perspective on communication theory originated from the development of information theory in the early 1920s.[18] Limited information-theoretic ideas had been developed at Bell Labs, all implicitly assuming events of equal probability. The history of information theory as a form of communication theory can be traced through a series of key papers during this time. Harry Nyquist's 1924 paper, Certain Factors Affecting Telegraph Speed, contains a theoretical section quantifying \"intelligence\" and the \"line speed\" at which it can be transmitted by a communication system. Ralph Hartley's 1928 paper, Transmission of Information, uses the word \"information\" as a measurable quantity, reflecting the receiver's ability to distinguish one sequence of symbols from any other. The natural unit of information was therefore the decimal digit, much later renamed the hartley in his honour as a unit or scale or measure of information. Alan Turing in 1940 used similar ideas as part of the statistical analysis of the breaking of the German second world war Enigma ciphers. The main landmark event that opened the way to the development of the information theory form of communication theory was the publication of an article by Claude Shannon (1916–2001) in the Bell System Technical Journal in July and October 1948 under the title \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\".[11] Shannon focused on the problem of how best to encode the information that a sender wants to transmit. He also used tools in probability theory, developed by Norbert Wiener.\n\nThey marked the nascent stages of applied communication theory at that time. Shannon developed information entropy as a measure for the uncertainty in a message while essentially inventing the field of information theory. \"The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point.\"[11] In 1949, in a declassified version of Shannon's wartime work on the mathematical theory of cryptography (\"Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems\"), he proved that all theoretically unbreakable ciphers must have the same requirements as the one-time pad. He is also credited with the introduction of sampling theory, which is concerned with representing a continuous-time signal from a (uniform) discrete set of samples. This theory was essential in enabling telecommunications to move from analog to digital transmissions systems in the 1960s and later. In 1951, Shannon made his fundamental contribution to natural language processing and computational linguistics with his article \"Prediction and Entropy of Printed English\" (1951), providing a clear quantifiable link between cultural practice and probabilistic cognition.\n\nTheories in interpersonal communication are concerned with the ways in which very small groups of people communicate with one another. It also provides the framework in which we view the world around us. Although interpersonal communication theories have their origin in mass communication studies of attitude and response to messages, since the 1970s, interpersonal communication theories have taken on a distinctly personal focus. Interpersonal theories examine relationships and their development, non-verbal communication, how we adapt to one another during conversation, how we develop the messages we seek to convey, and how deception works.[19][20]\n\nOrganizational communication theories address not only the ways in which people use communication in organizations, but also how they use communication to constitute that organization, developing structures, relationships, and practices to achieve their goals. Although early organization communication theories were characterized by a so-called container model (the idea that an organization is a clearly bounded object inside which communication happens in a straightforward manner following hierarchical lines), more recent theories have viewed the organization as a more fluid entity with fuzzy boundaries.[21] Studies within the field of organizational communication mention communication as a facilitating act and a precursor to organizational activity as cooperative systems.[22][23]\n\nGiven that its object of study is the organization, it is perhaps not surprising that organization communication scholarship has important connections to theories of management, with Management Communication Quarterly serving as a key venue for disseminating scholarly work.[24] However, theories in organizational communication retain a distinct identity through their critical perspective toward power and attention to the needs and interests of workers, rather than privileging the will of management.\n\nOrganizational communication can be distinguished by its orientation to four key problematics: voice (who can speak within an organization), rationality (how decisions are made and whose ends are served), organization (how is the organization itself structured and how does it function), and the organization-society relationship (how the organization may alternately serve, exploit, and reflect society as a whole).[25]\n\nThis line of theory examines how social order is both produced and reproduced through communication. Communication problems in the sociocultural tradition may be theorized in terms of misalignment, conflict, or coordination failure. Theories in this domain explore dynamics such as micro and macro level phenomena, structure versus agency, the local versus the global, and communication problems which emerge due to gaps of space and time, sharing some kinship with sociological and anthropological perspectives but distinguished by keen attention to communication as constructed and constitutive.[26]\n\nPolitical communication theories are concerned with the public exchange of messages among political actors of all kinds. This scope is in contrast to theories of political science which look inside political institutions to understand decision-making processes.[27] Early political communication theories examined the roles of mass communication (i.e. television and newspapers) and political parties on political discourse.[28] However, as the conduct of political discourse has expanded, theories of political communication have likewise developed, to now include models of deliberation and sensemaking, and discourses about a wide range of political topics: the role of the media (e.g. as a gatekeeper, framer, and agenda-setter); forms of government (e.g. democracy, populism, and autocracy); social change (e.g. activism and protests); economic order (e.g. capitalism, neoliberalism and socialism); human values (e.g. rights, norms, freedom, and authority.); and propaganda, disinformation, and trust.[29][30][27] Two of the important emerging areas for theorizing about political communication are the examination of civic engagement and international comparative work (given that much of political communication has been done in the United States).[27]\n\nTheories of computer-mediated communication or CMC emerged as a direct response to the rapid emergence of novel mediating communication technologies in the form of computers. CMC scholars inquire as to what may be lost and what may be gained when we shift many of our formerly unmediated and entrained practices (that is, activities that were necessarily conducted in a synchronized, ordered, dependent fashion) into mediated and disentrained modes. For example, a discussion that once required a meeting can now be an e-mail thread, an appointment confirmation that once involved a live phone call can now be a click on a text message, a collaborative writing project that once required an elaborate plan for drafting, circulating, and annotating can now take place in a shared document.\n\nCMC theories fall into three categories: cues-filtered-out theories, experiential/perceptual theories, and adaptation to/exploitation of media. Cues-filtered-out theories have often treated face-to-face interaction as the gold standard against which mediated communication should be compared, and includes such theories as social presence theory, media richness theory, and the Social Identity model of Deindividuation Effects (SIDE). Experiential/perceptual theories are concerned with how individuals perceive the capacity of technologies, such as whether the technology creates psychological closeness (electronic propinquity theory).[31] Adaptation/exploitation theories consider how people may creatively expand or make use of the limitations in CMC systems, including social information processing theory (SIP) and the idea of the hyperpersonal (when people make use of the limitations of the mediated channel to create a selective view of themselves with their communication partner, developing an impression that exceeds reality).[32][31] Theoretical work from Joseph Walther has been highly influential in the development of CMC. Theories in this area often examine the limitations and capabilities of new technologies, taking up an 'affordances' perspective inquiring what the technology may \"request, demand, encourage, discourage, refuse, and allow.\"[33] Recently the theoretical and empirical focus of CMC has shifted more explicitly away from the 'C' (i.e. Computer) and toward the 'M' (i.e. Mediation).[34]\n\nTheories in rhetoric and speech are often concerned with discourse as an art, including practical consideration of the power of words and our ability to improve our skills through practice.[26] Rhetorical theories provide a way of analyzing speeches when read in an exegetical manner (close, repeated reading to extract themes, metaphors, techniques, argument, meaning, etc.); for example with respect to their relationship to power or justice, or their persuasion, emotional appeal, or logic.[35][36]\n\nCritical social theory in communication, while sharing some traditions with rhetoric, is explicitly oriented toward \"articulating, questioning, and transcending presuppositions that are judged to be untrue, dishonest, or unjust.\"[26](p. 147) Some work bridges this distinction to form critical rhetoric.[37] Critical theories have their roots in the Frankfurt School, which brought together anti-establishment thinkers alarmed by the rise of Nazism and propaganda, including the work of Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno.[38] Modern critical perspectives often engage with emergent social movements such as post-colonialism and queer theory, seeking to be reflective and emancipatory.[39] One of the influential bodies of theory in this area comes from the work of Stuart Hall, who questioned traditional assumptions about the monolithic functioning of mass communication with his Encoding/Decoding Model of Communication and offered significant expansions of theories of discourse, semiotics, and power through media criticism and explorations of linguistic codes and cultural identity.[40][41]\n\nAxiology is concerned with how values inform research and theory development. Most communication theory is guided by one of three axiological approaches.[43] The first approach recognizes that values will influence theorists' interests but suggests that those values must be set aside once actual research begins. Outside replication of research findings is particularly important in this approach to prevent individual researchers' values from contaminating their findings and interpretations. The second approach rejects the idea that values can be eliminated from any stage of theory development. Within this approach, theorists do not try to divorce their values from inquiry. Instead, they remain mindful of their values so that they understand how those values contextualize, influence or skew their findings. The third approach not only rejects the idea that values can be separated from research and theory, but rejects the idea that they should be separated. This approach is often adopted by critical theorists who believe that the role of communication theory is to identify oppression and produce social change. In this axiological approach, theorists embrace their values and work to reproduce those values in their research and theory development.\n• Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication"

        "document": "Communication is a complex process, and it is difficult to determine where or with whom a communication encounter starts and ends. It can sometimes be helpful to consider different communication models. Below are some questions to help guide you through this chapter.\n\nModels of communication simplify the process by providing a visual representation of the various aspects of a communication encounter. Some models explain communication in more detail than others, but even the most complex model still doesn’t recreate what we experience in even a moment of a communication encounter. Models still serve a valuable purpose for students of communication because they allow us to see specific concepts and steps within the process of communication, define communication, and apply communication concepts. When you become aware of how communication functions, you can think more deliberately through your communication encounters, which can help you better prepare for future communication and learn from your previous communication. The three models of communication we will discuss are the transmission, interaction, and transaction models.\n\nAlthough these models of communication differ, they contain some common elements. The first two models we will discuss, the transmission model and the interaction model, include the following parts: participants, messages, encoding, decoding, and channels. In communication models, the participants are the senders and/or receivers of messages in a communication encounter. The message is the verbal or nonverbal content being conveyed from sender to receiver. For example, when you say “Hello!” to your friend, you are sending a message of greeting that will be received by your friend.\n\nThe internal cognitive process that allows participants to send, receive, and understand messages is the encoding and decoding process. Encoding is the process of turning thoughts into communication. As we will learn later, the level of conscious thought that goes into encoding messages varies. Decoding is the process of turning communication into thoughts. For example, you may realize you’re hungry and encode the following message to send to your roommate: “I’m hungry. Do you want to get pizza tonight?” As your roommate receives the message, they decode your communication and turn it back into thoughts in order to make meaning out of it. Of course, we don’t just communicate verbally—we have various options, or channels for communication. Encoded messages are sent through a channel, or a sensory route on which a message travels, to the receiver for decoding. While communication can be sent and received using any sensory route (sight, smell, touch, taste, or sound), most communication occurs through visual (sight) and/or auditory (sound) channels. If your roommate has headphones on and is engrossed in a video game, you may need to get their attention by waving your hands before you can ask them about dinner.\n\nThe linear or transmission model of communication, as shown in Figure 2.2.1, describes communication as a linear, one-way process in which a sender intentionally transmits a message to a receiver (Ellis & McClintock, 1990). This model focuses on the sender and message within a communication encounter. Although the receiver is included in the model, this role is viewed as more of a target or end point rather than part of an ongoing process. We are left to presume that the receiver either successfully receives and understands the message or does not. The scholars who designed this model extended on a linear model proposed by Aristotle centuries before that included a speaker, message, and hearer. They were also influenced by the advent and spread of new communication technologies of the time such as telegraphy and radio, and you can probably see these technical influences within the model (Shannon & Weaver, 1949). Think of how a radio message is sent from a person in the radio studio to you listening in your car. The sender is the radio announcer who encodes a verbal message that is transmitted by a radio tower through electromagnetic waves (the channel) and eventually reaches your (the receiver’s) ears via an antenna and speakers in order to be decoded. The radio announcer doesn’t really know if you receive their message or not, but if the equipment is working and the channel is free of static, then there is a good chance that the message was successfully received.\n\nAlthough the transmission model may seem simple or even underdeveloped to us today, the creation of this model allowed scholars to examine the communication process in new ways, which eventually led to more complex models and theories of communication. The interactive or interaction model of communication, as shown in Figure 2.2.2, describes communication as a process in which participants alternate positions as sender and receiver and generate meaning by sending messages and receiving feedback within physical and psychological contexts (Schramm, 1997). Rather than illustrating communication as a linear, one-way process, the interactive model incorporates feedback, which makes communication a more interactive, two-way process. Feedback includes messages sent in response to other messages. For example, your instructor may respond to a point you raise during class discussion or you may point to the sofa when your roommate asks you where the remote control is. The inclusion of a feedback loop also leads to a more complex understanding of the roles of participants in a communication encounter. Rather than having one sender, one message, and one receiver, this model has two sender-receivers who exchange messages. Each participant alternates roles as sender and receiver in order to keep a communication encounter going. Although this seems like a perceptible and deliberate process, we alternate between the roles of sender and receiver very quickly and often without conscious thought. The interactive model is also less message focused and more interaction focused. While the linear model focused on how a message was transmitted and whether or not it was received, the interactive model is more concerned with the communication process itself. In fact, this model acknowledges that there are so many messages being sent at one time that many of them may not even be received. Some messages are also unintentionally sent. Therefore, communication isn’t judged effective or ineffective in this model based on whether or not a single message was successfully transmitted and received. The interactive model takes physical and psychological context into account. Physical context includes the environmental factors in a communication encounter. The size, layout, temperature, and lighting of a space influence our communication. Imagine the different physical contexts in which job interviews take place and how that may affect your communication. I have had job interviews over the phone, crowded around a table with eight interviewers, and sitting with few people around an extra large conference table. I’ve also been walked around an office to unexpectedly interview one-on-one, in succession, with multiple members of a search committee over a period of three hours. Whether it’s the size of the room or other environmental factors, it’s important to consider the role that physical context plays in our communication. Psychological context includes the mental and emotional factors in a communication encounter. Stress, anxiety, and emotions are just some examples of psychological influences that can affect our communication. Seemingly positive psychological states, like experiencing the emotion of love, can also affect communication. Feedback and context help make the interaction model a more useful illustration of the communication process, but the transaction model views communication as a powerful tool that shapes our realities beyond individual communication encounters. As the study of communication progressed, models expanded to account for more of the communication process. Many scholars view communication as more than a process that is used to carry on conversations and convey meaning. We don’t send messages like computers, and we don’t neatly alternate between the roles of sender and receiver as an interaction unfolds. We also can’t consciously decide to stop communicating because communication is more than sending and receiving messages. The transaction model differs from the transmission and interaction models in significant ways, including the conceptualization of communication, the role of sender and receiver, and the role of context (Barnlund, 1970). The transaction model of communication describes communication as a process in which communicators generate social realities within social, relational, and cultural contexts. In this model, which is shown in Figure 2.2.3, we don’t just communicate to exchange messages; we communicate to create relationships, form intercultural alliances, shape our self-concepts, and engage with others in dialogue to create communities. The roles of sender and receiver in the transaction model of communication differ significantly from the other models. Instead of labeling participants as senders and receivers, the people in a communication encounter are referred to as communicators. Unlike the interactive model, which suggests that participants alternate positions as sender and receiver, the transaction model suggests that we are simultaneously senders and receivers. This is an important addition to the model because it allows us to understand how we are able to adapt our communication—for example, a verbal message—in the middle of sending it based on the communication we are simultaneously receiving from our communication partner. The transaction model also includes a more complex understanding of context. The interaction model portrays context as physical and psychological influences that enhance or impede communication. While these contexts are important, they focus on message transmission and reception. Since the transaction model of communication views communication as a force that shapes our realities before and after specific interactions occur, it must account for contextual influences outside of a single interaction. To do this, the transaction model considers how social, relational, and cultural contexts frame and influence our communication encounters. Social context refers to the stated rules or unstated norms that guide communication. Norms are social conventions that we pick up on through observation, practice, and trial and error. We may not even know we are breaking a social norm until we notice people looking at us strangely or someone corrects or teases us. Relational context includes the previous interpersonal history and type of relationship we have with a person. We communicate differently with someone we just met versus someone we’ve known for a long time. Initial interactions with people tend to be more highly scripted and governed by established norms and rules, but when we have an established relational context, we may be able to bend or break social norms and rules more easily. Cultural context includes various aspects of identities such as race, gender, nationality, ethnicity, sexual orientation, class, and ability. We all have multiple cultural identities that influence our communication. Some people, especially those with identities that have been historically marginalized, are regularly aware of how their cultural identities influence their communication and influence how others communicate with them. Conversely, people with identities that are dominant or in the majority may rarely, if ever, think about the role their cultural identities play in their communication. Cultural context is influenced by numerous aspects of our identities and is not limited to race or ethnicity. Barnlund, D. C. (1970). A transactional model of communication in K.K. Sereno and C.D.

        "document": "Effective communication between IT teams and the rest of the organization has become a critical success factor as organizations increasingly rely on digital technologies. Misunderstandings can expose the company to cyberattacks, delay projects and ultimately hinder overall business growth.\n\nExplore these strategies for bridging the gap between technical expertise and everyday business operations to facilitate more effective organizational interactions.\n\nTechnical jargon can quickly overwhelm nontechnical staff. Elementary terms like “cloud computing” and “server downtime” seem straightforward, but things start to get tricky with lingo like “blockchain interoperability” and “homomorphic encryption.”\n\nComplex language will only lead to confusion and frustration. The goal should be to pass the message along in the simplest way possible when discussing IT-related projects or issues. Including an easy-access glossary for staff members to look up unfamiliar terms may be ideal when jargon is unavoidable.\n\nHaving dedicated channels for IT-related communications is crucial. Without designated spaces for discussions, important information can get lost in the shuffle of emails or team chats. Many platforms allow users to create channels for specific subjects so everyone knows where to turn for help.\n\nFor example, a dedicated Slack channel called #IT-support can allow employees to post their technical issues and receive real-time assistance from IT staff. Imagine a sales department frequently encountering issues with its customer relationship management software. Having a direct line of communication with the IT team helps them quickly resolve problems without lengthy email threads.\n\nIndustry data show well-informed employees are up to 77% more efficient than their less-informed colleagues. This statistic underscores the significance of assessing the audience's familiarity with technology and tailoring technical information accordingly.\n\nAn effective approach is to prioritize communicating a product's or process's key benefits over extraneous details. For example, when presenting a new tool to the marketing team, focus on how it will enhance their workflows rather than discussing technical specifications.\n\nScheduled meetings between IT and other departments provide the perfect opportunity to discuss ongoing projects and challenges. They’re also great for deliberating and planning upcoming campaigns requiring technical support, as well as addressing roadblocks individuals may be facing.\n\nFurthermore, these inter-team huddles may be ideal for promoting cross-training initiatives where employees can gain insights into each other’s work. This approach facilitates improved communication by bridging the knowledge gap between diverse IT domains and the rest of the organization.\n\nEmploying visual communication tools such as infographics, charts and dashboards can simplify complex IT information and convey it more clearly. For instance, when explaining system downtime statistics, use a graph to show trends over time instead of just listing numbers.\n\nResearch indicates the human brain processes visuals 60,000 times faster than text and can remember 65% of the information better. Transforming raw technical data into engaging illustrations makes communication more interactive and interesting, boosting the chances of effective retention.\n\nEstablish structured feedback loops where other departments can share their experiences with IT services, tools or projects. Conducting regular surveys or Q&A sessions can provide insights into how well IT is meeting the needs of other teams and identify improvement areas. For instance, after a presentation on cybersecurity measures, invite people to ask questions or share their concerns about potential vulnerabilities in their departments.\n\nA key aspect of this strategy is creating an open environment where employees feel comfortable asking questions without fear of being ridiculed. This approach promotes a culture of support and continuous improvement within the organization.\n\nInformation silos represent a major IT operational gap, leading to conflicting priorities and redundancies, ultimately affecting all business areas. Eliminating these silos requires transparency in decision-making processes related to technology changes or implementations.\n\nClearly communicate the rationale behind decisions made by the IT department so other teams understand how these choices align with organizational goals. Transparency also makes it easier for internal stakeholders to trust the IT department, ensuring various business units work together to achieve shared objectives.\n\n8. Develop IT Liaisons in Each Department\n\nFor larger organizations with diversified teams and functions, identifying and training IT ambassadors within each department can help streamline communications. This person becomes the go-to resource for disseminating technical information and updates in a way employees can easily understand.\n\nImproving communication between IT teams and the rest of the organization provides several key benefits that make the process worth the investment.\n\nWhen IT teams communicate effectively with other departments, it leads to better collaboration on projects and initiatives. Clear communication ensures everyone is aligned on goals, timelines and expectations, minimizing delays.\n\nStrong cybersecurity awareness is paramount as more employees work remotely. Effective communication between IT and other departments helps circulate crucial information about cyberthreats and best practices so they know how to protect sensitive data. Phishing remains a critical concern, with 13% of remote employees admitting to falling for these attacks, exposing their organizations to costly remediations.\n\nOpen lines of communication encourage a culture where employees feel comfortable asking questions and seeking help from IT. This environment promotes continuous learning and professional development across the organization, leading to more knowledgeable staff who can contribute effectively.\n\nIT teams that maintain good communication with other departments can quickly identify and resolve technical issues before they escalate into significant problems. This proactive approach minimizes downtime and keeps operations running smoothly.\n\nToday’s organizations must be agile and adaptable. Effective communication between IT teams and other departments allows for quicker adjustments to new technologies or processes, ensuring all employees are on board with changes.\n\nStreamline Communications Between IT and Other Teams\n\nThe role of IT departments in the modern workplace extends far beyond just managing systems and troubleshooting issues. They must be able to convey information in a way that resonates with the intended audience and facilitates cross-functional engagement. Thoughtfully implementing these proven strategies can help bridge communication gaps and create a culture of mutual respect across the company."

They build on each other's ideas and create stronger solutions.\n\nListening carefully to clients helps developers nail their needs. The result? Products that hit the mark.\n\nIn software development, clear communication is crucial. Long, complex messages can cause confusion. Here's how to keep it simple:\n\nBreak down tough concepts. When explaining a new feature to non-techies:\n\nBefore you speak or write:\n\nThis keeps you on track and makes your message easier to follow.\n\nThe goal? Understanding, not showing off.\n• Make it relevant to them\n• Be specific: Don't say \"it's not working.\" Say what \"it\" is and describe the problem\n\n3. Pick the Right Way to Communicate\n\nChoosing the right communication tool can make or break your software project. Let's dive into how to pick the best method for your team.\n\nThe situation dictates whether to use instant or delayed communication:\n\nSlack's great for quick chats. Use it for:\n\nBut don't ditch email. It's still king for:\n\nBarbara Pachter, a business communications coach, warns: \"Be careful of your wording.\" This is crucial for written communication where tone can be tricky.\n\nWhen choosing a communication tool, think about:\n\nTake ClickUp, for example. It's free for unlimited users - perfect for big teams on a budget. Plus, you can turn chat messages into tasks with one click. No more lost ideas in chat threads!\n\nA combo of real-time and delayed communication often works best:\n• Go real-time for urgent stuff or when you need instant feedback\n• Use delayed comms for different time zones or when people need time to think\n\nRemember: The right tool at the right time can make all the difference in your project's success.\n\nLet's break down how devs talk: email, chat, and face-to-face. Each has its ups and downs.\n\nWhen to use what:\n\nGo for email when you need a record or detailed info. It's perfect for:\n\nTools like Slack or Teams are great for:\n\nPick the right tool for the job. As Barbara Pachter, a biz comms pro, says:\n\nThis applies to both email and chat. Choose wisely!\n\nYour body language can make or break your communication as a software developer. It affects how others see your ideas and skills, even when you're not talking.\n\nHere's how to use body language to your advantage:\n\nStand tall and own your space\n\nGood posture isn't just for your back. Standing or sitting straight with shoulders back shows confidence. It's key in presentations and team meetings.\n\nIn work chats, aim for eye contact 50-60% of the time. It shows you're engaged and trustworthy. But don't stare - it's creepy.\n\nKeep your arms uncrossed and use open palms when talking. It shows you're open and honest. Avoid pointing or chopping motions - they can seem aggressive.\n\nYour face often gives away your true feelings. Practice keeping a neutral or positive expression, especially during tough conversations or feedback sessions.\n\nWhen someone's talking, lean in slightly. It shows you're listening. But respect personal space - don't get too close!\n\nYour nonverbal cues can back up or contradict your words. As Derald Wing Sue from Columbia University notes, some body language can come across as \"microaggressions\", affecting how others see you.\n\nSeeing things from your team's perspective is crucial in software development. It's not just about listening - it's about really getting where others are coming from.\n\nWhy? It builds trust, leads to better problem-solving, and helps create products users actually want.\n\nHere's how to do it:\n• Listen actively: Focus on understanding, not just waiting to speak.\n• Consider different roles: Think about how decisions affect various team members.\n• Use empathy in code reviews: Try to understand the reasoning behind the code.\n\nHave team members switch roles for a day. A developer might try UX design, while a project manager codes.\n\nCreate detailed profiles of your end users. It keeps everyone focused on the user.\n\nHold regular meetings where everyone shares their perspective on recent work.\n\nMatch people from different specialties to work on tasks together.\n\nIn software development, writing things down and sharing knowledge is crucial. Here's why it matters and how to do it effectively:\n\nUse both notebooks and digital apps. Alex Hyett, a software developer, combines Moleskine notebooks for quick ideas with Notion for team project tracking.\n\nSet aside time to review and refresh your notes.\n\nAssign colors to different concepts for easy scanning.\n\nUse a central system for important info. Atlassian uses Confluence as their knowledge repository.\n\nIf you repeat something three times, document it.\n\nEncourage team members to share their expertise. Westpac created a platform where employees both learn and teach.\n\nFeedback is crucial for developers. It boosts work quality and team bonds. Here's how to nail it:\n\nHe suggests framing feedback as a team effort to improve the codebase.\n\nRemember: Good feedback is a two-way street. Give it thoughtfully, receive it openly, and watch your team thrive.\n\nTalking to non-tech teammates can be tough for developers. But it's crucial. Here's how to nail it:\n\nDitch the jargon: Use plain English. Instead of \"We're implementing a new API\", say \"We're building a tool to connect our systems\".\n\nUse analogies: Compare tech to everyday stuff. Like this:\n\nFocus on results: Non-tech folks care about outcomes, not how you get there. Explain how your work solves problems.\n\nShow, don't tell: Use diagrams or flowcharts for complex ideas.\n\nCheck in: Ask questions. If someone looks lost, try explaining differently.\n\nBe patient: It might take a few tries. That's fine. Keep calm and keep explaining.\n\nRemember, it's not about dumbing down. It's about making ideas accessible. As one dev put it:\n\nDisagreements happen in dev teams. They can be about tech, communication, or work styles. Here's how to handle them:\n\nCatch it early: Watch for signs like tense meetings or less teamwork. Barry O'Kane says:\n\nFind the real issue: Use the 5 Whys to dig deeper. What looks like a tech problem might be about unclear goals.\n\nListen well: Focus on understanding, not just responding. Repeat what others say to check you've got it.\n\nBe open to others' ideas when it's not critical. This builds trust for when you need to stand firm.\n\nTake a break: If things get heated, pause. Come back when everyone's calmer.\n\nHave a decider: For tech debates that won't end, let a lead make the call. It keeps things moving.\n\nLearn from it: After solving an issue, talk about it as a team. How can you do better next time?\n\nGood communication is key for software dev teams. These 9 tips can boost teamwork, cut errors, and up productivity.\n\nThese skills need practice. Start small - pick one or two areas to work on. Try active listening in your next meeting by repeating key points.\n\nGood communication isn't just talking. It's about shared understanding. As Barry O'Kane said, \"If something feels 'off', speak up.\" This can stop small issues from blowing up.\n\nDon't ignore these soft skills. A McKinsey study found 84% of devs struggle with remote comms. By improving, you're making your whole team stronger.\n\nSo, use these tips. Your projects will run smoother, and your team will work better together. Go for it!\n\nHow can you communicate better during software installation?\n\nWant to boost communication during software installation? Here's how:\n\nMap out the installation process step-by-step. Share it with your team. Everyone should know what's happening and when.\n\nDitch the jargon. Explain tech stuff in plain English. Break down complex ideas into bite-sized chunks.\n\n3. Ask the right questions\n\nGet your team talking. Ask things like, \"What bumps in the road do you see ahead?\" It'll help you spot issues before they blow up.\n\nDon't wait to involve your developers. Their know-how can make the installation smoother from the get-go.\n\nChoose communication tools that fit your team like a glove.

        "document": "Software implementation is a critical phase in the lifecycle of any project, as it determines the successful integration of a new software system into an organization’s operations. This process involves transitioning from the planning and development stages to the practical use of the software. Effective software implementation is essential to achieve the desired outcomes and maximize the return on investment (ROI). However, the road to successful implementation is often fraught with challenges. These challenges can include user resistance, technical issues, data migration complications, and disruptions to ongoing business operations.\n\nBefore embarking on the software implementation journey, it’s imperative to establish clear and well-defined objectives and requirements. These objectives should align closely with the organization’s strategic goals and operational needs. Setting specific and measurable goals provides a roadmap for the implementation process, ensuring that all stakeholders share a common understanding of the desired outcomes. This approach safeguards against scope creep and prevents confusion during implementation. When objectives are unambiguous, the implementation team can work cohesively towards achieving them.\n\nThe success of software implementation heavily relies on the skills and coordination of the implementation team. This team typically consists of individuals with diverse expertise, including project managers, software developers, subject matter experts, and end-users. Each member plays a crucial role in ensuring a smooth transition. Collaboration among team members is paramount; effective communication and a shared sense of responsibility ensure that tasks are completed efficiently. A strong implementation team possesses technical proficiency, understands the organization’s goals, and can translate them into actionable steps.\n\nA comprehensive implementation plan serves as a roadmap for the entire process. It outlines the sequence of tasks, assigns responsibilities, and sets achievable milestones and timelines. A well-structured plan considers potential risks and includes contingencies to address unforeseen challenges. Establishing a realistic timeline allows you to manage stakeholders’ expectations and provide a clear overview of the project’s progression. A carefully crafted plan guides the implementation team and facilitates stakeholder communication about the project’s status.\n\nSelecting the right software solution is a pivotal decision in the implementation process. Thoroughly evaluating different software options involves assessing their features, functionalities, scalability, and compatibility with existing systems. The selected software should align with the organisation’s specific needs, offering solutions to existing challenges and potential growth areas. Careful evaluation reduces the likelihood of investing in a solution that exceeds expectations.\n\nWhile software customisation can tailor the solution to fit specific requirements, striking a balance is essential. Extensive customisation can lead to complexities during future upgrades and maintenance. Carefully consider whether customisation is necessary for achieving the desired outcomes. In cases where customisation is essential, focus on modifying elements that directly impact business processes. Balancing customisation with the software’s inherent capabilities ensures long-term usability without sacrificing flexibility.\n\nTransparent communication is the backbone of successful software implementation. Regular updates and open dialogue with stakeholders, including end-users, management, and IT teams, foster a shared understanding of the implementation’s progress and challenges. This transparency helps mitigate misunderstandings, align expectations, and build stakeholder trust. Through open communication, you can proactively address concerns and adapt to changing requirements.\n\nIntroducing a new software system often requires a cultural shift within an organisation. End-users and support staff must be adequately trained to ensure a seamless transition. Proper training not only familiarises users with the software’s functionalities but also emphasises its benefits to their daily tasks. Ongoing support is equally crucial, as it helps users troubleshoot issues and maximises their efficiency. Investing in training and support minimises resistance to change and accelerates user adoption.\n\nMigrating data from existing systems to the new software can be complex and challenging. The integrity and accuracy of data must be maintained throughout the migration process. A well-defined data migration strategy includes data mapping, cleansing, and validation. By proactively identifying potential pitfalls and addressing data-related concerns, you ensure that critical business information is preserved during the transition.\n\nComprehensive testing is integral to identifying and rectifying issues before they impact the organisation’s operations. This includes unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing. Testing not only validates the software’s functionality but also ensures its compatibility with different systems and environments. By rigorously testing the software, you reduce the likelihood of costly post-implementation fixes and optimise its performance from the outset.\n\nResistance to change is a common hurdle in software implementation. Identifying potential sources of resistance—such as fear of the unknown, concerns about job security, or reluctance to adapt to new processes—allows you to develop strategies to address these challenges. Engaging stakeholders early and involving them in decision-making can mitigate resistance. Clear communication about the new software’s benefits and transparently addressing concerns can foster buy-in and support.\n\nRather than a sudden switch, a phased implementation approach can smooth the transition. Implement the software incrementally, starting with a smaller group of users. This approach allows for real-world testing and the incorporation of user feedback into subsequent phases. Feedback from end-users is invaluable for identifying areas that require refinement and enhancement. Gradual rollout and feedback incorporation promote a sense of ownership among users and enhance the software’s usability.\n\nPost-implementation monitoring is crucial for assessing the software’s performance against established KPIs. Tracking metrics such as user adoption rates, system uptime, and process efficiency provides insights into the software’s impact on the organisation. Monitoring helps identify areas that require further optimisation and guides decision-making for future upgrades or enhancements.\n\nThe journey doesn’t end with implementation; continuous improvement is an ongoing process. Iterative refinement involves analysing user feedback, monitoring performance, and addressing emerging challenges. Regular updates, feature enhancements, and bug fixes contribute to the software’s evolution, ensuring that it remains aligned with the organisation’s evolving needs. This approach enhances user satisfaction and supports the organisation’s long-term goals.\n\nSuccessful software implementation goes beyond technical execution; it requires a holistic approach that encompasses careful planning, effective communication, and ongoing refinement. By adhering to these best practices, organisations can navigate the challenges of implementation and achieve their desired outcomes. A well-implemented software system has the potential to transform operations, enhance efficiency, and contribute to the organisation’s overall success.\n\nTo further enhance your business’s path to success, consider partnering with Ubique Digital Solutions.

        "document": "When it comes to customer experience, communication and engagement are two factors that heavily influence overall success. It’s important to keep this in mind so your campaigns don’t fall flat. For example, implementing a new business technology, like a customer engagement platform, can be a complex process that affects staff and customers. But a well-designed communication campaign that includes effective customer engagement and organizational change management activities can help the implementation go smoothly.\n\nUtilities often underestimate the importance of stakeholder communication and education, so we’ve pulled together five tips to help your team implement a successful communication strategy that will support a variety of activities and programs that may be on your horizon.\n\nBefore we dive into our tips, it’s important to establish the key components of a thorough campaign strategy. While some of the elements can change depending on the project, we recommend taking the following steps to create a comprehensive strategy:\n• Facilitate the development of the overall branding\n• Establish the means to measure the success of the campaign\n• Develop a schedule to serve as the living guide for project deliverables\n\nOur first and possibly most important tip for designing an effective communication campaign is also our recommended first step in designing a communication strategy. It serves as the foundation that determines the direction for the rest of the strategy and influences the long-term outcomes. Let’s break down each element:\n• Goals. Create specific communication goals and objectives rather than relying on the overall project goals to keep you on track.\n• Risks. Identify risks during the planning phase so you’re prepared to take a proactive approach in mitigating any pushback or concerns along the way.\n• Benefits. Identify the benefits so you are prepared to answer the common stakeholder question, What’s in it for me? Focus on benefits to individual stakeholders. For example, how will the change make a staff member’s job easier? Or how will it help a customer save money or access their account information faster?\n\nOrganizational change management ( ) is the collection of tools, techniques, and mindsets that help organizations make sure people are ready to engage, willing to commit, and able to do what it takes to realize the full potential of solutions.\n\nThere are several ways to incorporate best practices to support your staff during a transformational utility program or technology implementation:\n• Analyze stakeholders. It can be a tedious process, but it’s important to listen to and validate stakeholders’ concerns. Make sure you understand their communication preferences.\n• Educate and engage staff. A successful communication strategy should focus inward too. For example, if a customer calls with questions about your new program, contact center staff need to be able to provide accurate information and assistance. We suggest outlining a new program’s benefits and clearly communicating them to all necessary stakeholders. Take it to the next level by conducting training and education sessions, making sure all departments understand the program’s impact and can address customer inquiries.\n• Involve sponsors. Engage with your sponsors early on to make sure they’re actively participating throughout the project and serving as advocates for your vision.\n• Undertake reinforcement planning. Reinforcement becomes important toward the end of (and even after) implementation to ensure long-term success. For example, a rewards and recognition program can keep the momentum going.\n\nIf you need help building understanding and buy-in for a new technology or other change, our consulting team can help you develop a custom strategy that will resonate with stakeholders. Our approach applies processes, tools, and techniques to help your staff effectively transition from business as usual to utility dream team. Contact us today to get started.\n\nKeep customers informed about new technologies that affect them\n\nLet’s stick with our new business technology implementation example. If your utility is upgrading its customer information system ( ) or rolling out advanced metering infrastructure ( ), your customers (and your staff) will need to be engaged and prepared. There are many ways to keep customers in the loop.\n\nTo reach your entire customer base, we recommend using multiple channels, including your website, social media, mailed notices, door hangers, brochures, press releases, and community events.\n\nTo reach your entire customer base, we recommend using multiple channels, including your website, social media, mailed notices, door hangers, brochures, press releases, and community events. Spread the news—and critical information—far and wide to prevent confusion, disruption, and stress.\n\nWe covered these strategies and more in our recent webinar Successful strategies for technology implementation communications, now available to watch on demand.\n\nUse storytelling to educate in an entertaining way\n\nMany utilities struggle to engage customers with their content across various platforms. Don’t underestimate the power of storytelling. It’s an important tool to help you connect with your residential and business customers’ values, senses, and emotions.\n\nBy presenting your company and its offerings in a story narrative—easily executed in emails, ads, and social media posts—you can entertain your customers and help them better remember your offerings. Effective storytelling frameworks include:\n• Hero’s journey. The hero’s journey typically features a main character who sets out on a journey to make a change. They run into a problem but ultimately triumph, usually with a little help. It’s can be an effective storytelling approach for utilities because you can show all the ways you help customers overcome obstacles with your programs, products, or services.\n• Wake-up call. The wake-up call starts the scene in the middle of the conflict. Your customer is pulled into the drama, investigates the origin of the problem, and determines how they can solve it. You can present a product or program as the solution, serving as a wake-up call for the customer.\n• Before-and-after. The before-and-after approach shows your customer in their current reality compared to their ideal reality. This approach helps you market your products or programs as ways to make customers’ dreams become reality. This approach helps you market your products or programs as ways to make customers’ dreams become reality.\n\nFor more frameworks, check out our e-book 8 storytelling frameworks for utilities. It includes effective storytelling examples that will influence how people feel about your utility’s brand and highlight your unique value.\n\nGet social and involved in the community to spread the word\n\nIf you need help getting the word out, lean on your local community and use social media. We recommend building partnerships with organizations and businesses in your community to expand the reach of your marketing campaigns.\n\nThink about the organizations your customers interact with and the businesses they patronize. For example, ask grocery stores to display a flyer about your program or ask schools to send students home with a handout for their caregivers. Partnering with community organizations is a good way to reach specific customers and show you’re involved in the community.\n\nAnother great way to spread the word is via social media. Utilities are engaging with customers on social media more than ever, meeting customers where they are. The most popular social media platforms for utilities are:\n\nBut don’t be intimidated by social media trends. New platforms like are an opportunity to connect with even more customers.
