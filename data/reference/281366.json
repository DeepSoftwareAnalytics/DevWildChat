        "document": "Tools like ADUC and ADAC enable Sysadmins to create a new user in an Active Directory quite easily, but they has certain limitations when it comes to bulk user creation. PowerShell is a powerful and flexible tool for creating Active Directory accounts, and much more at scale.\n\nThis blog reviews the process to create a new Active Directory user with PowerShell cmdlet New-ADUser. We’ll cover the top use cases for this cmdlet and provides its full syntax so you can explore it further.\n\nUsing ADUC and ADAC, it is simple to add a single user, but they both lack the functionality to create users in bulk. PowerShell offers multiple ways to not only create a single user but to create Active Directory user objects in bulk. Let’s start by reviewing the syntax and parameters of the cmdlet we’ll use: New-ADUser.\n\nYou can use certain parameters with the New-ADUser command to populate the most common user properties.\n• Using the OtherAttributes parameter, you can change property values that are not related to cmdlet parameters. Make sure to enclose the attribute name in single quotes when using this parameter.\n• To create a user, you must give the SamAccountName parameter.\n• The container or organizational unit (OU) for the new user is specified by the Path parameter. When the Path option is not used, the cmdlet creates a user object in the domain’s default user object container.\n\nThe following techniques describe various ways to build an object using this cmdlet:\n• With the New-ADUser command, provide the commonly used parameters and values and set any additional values by using the OtherAttributes parameter.\n• You can also create a new user from a template. Use the Instance parameter to create a new user or copy an existing one to the new object. The object used in the Instance parameter is used as a template.\n• To create Active Directory user objects in bulk, combine the Import-Csv cmdlet with the New-ADUser cmdlet.\n• Import a CSV file with a list of object properties to construct custom objects using the Import-Csv cmdlet.\n• The New-ADUser cmdlet can then be used to construct user objects by passing these objects through its pipeline.\n\nBefore we get started, we need to enable the Active Directory PowerShell module built into Microsoft Windows Server 2008R2/2012 and above by running this command:\n\nNow let’s review the syntax of the New-ADUser cmdlet:\n\nHere is the same information in a format that you can copy and modify according to your needs:\n\nThe New-ADUser cmdlet offers more than 60 parameters, but you don’t need to know them all right away. Here are the ones most commonly used to create AD user accounts:\n\nNow let’s walk through some of the primary ways you might use PowerShell to provision user accounts:\n• Create a user and set attributes not covered by the cmdlet’s parameters.\n• Create a new user based on an existing AD user.\n• Create users in bulk by importing their attributes from a CSV file.\n\nExample 1: Specify only the account name\n\nLet’s start with the simplest case: creating a new user account by specifying only its name attribute. For example:\n\nRunning this will create the user but won’t show any output. To check whether the user was added successfully, we can list all Active Directory users using the following script:\n\nThere it is, the last one in the list!\n\nHowever, note that the user we just created has more attributes than just a name; the following attributes are set by default:\n• The account is created in the “Users” container.\n• The account is a member of the Domain Users group.\n• The user must reset the password at the first logon.\n\nMany desired attributes are not populated. In particular, no password is set.\n\nAccordingly, let’s make a new account that’s actually usable by specifying more attributes:\n\nThe Read-Host parameter will ask you to input a new password. Note that the password should meet the length, complexity and history requirements of your domain security policy.\n\nNow let’s take a look at the results by running the following cmdlet:\n\nExample 3: Specify even more attributes\n\nTo create a full-fledged user account with even more attributes, use the following command.\n\nLet’s look at just a few of the new user’s attributes:\n\nAs noted above, by default, the New-ADUser cmdlet creates the new user in the “Users” container in the domain. To create the user in a different OU, use the -Path parameter with the distinguished name of the desired OU:\n\nThe New-ADUser cmdlet’s 60+ parameters cover the common attributes of a new user, but there are still plenty of less commonly used attributes. You can populate them using the -OtherAttributes parameter. In this example, we populate extensionattribute1 and the custom attribute carlicense:\n\nLet’s verify the results using the Get-ADUser command, as shown below.\n\nMost user objects in Active Directory have the class user. But you can also create user objects with the class inetOrgPerson, which has user as a parent class. The inetOrgPerson class facilitates integration with certain applications and simplifies the migration of certain user objects into Active Directory.\n\nTo create an inetOrgPerson user account, simply include the -Type parameter and specify inetOrgPerson as its value:\n\nIn the following screenshot, notice the type of the new user Benedict Cumberbatch and the type of the user Jason Bourne that we created earlier:\n\nAccounts are created with the following default properties:\n• Account is created in the “Users” container.\n• User must reset the password at the first logon.\n\nTherefore, to make a new account that’s actually usable, we need to enable it using the Enable-ADAccount cmdlet and give it a password using the Set-ADAccountPassword cmdlet.\n\nSo let’s create a new account with the following attributes:\n\nThe Read-Host parameter will ask you to input new password. Note that the password should meet the length, complexity and history requirements of your domain security policy.\n\nNow let’s take a look at the results by running the following cmdlet:\n\nCreate a New User Based on an Existing User\n\nSometimes, you want to create a new user that has nearly all the same properties of an existing user. First, we need to create a template based on the existing user. Here, we create a template with 5 properties of the user Benedict Cumberbatch. The second line sets the value for userPrincipalName to null because that attribute is unique forest-wide. The template is stored in the $temp_UserAccount variable.\n\nNow we can create a new user that will have the 5 attributes from our template (by specifying the Instance parameter with the value $temp_UserAccount), plus several other attributes we specify:\n\nWe can use the Get-ADUser command to see the new user:\n\nNotice that the properties we listed are the same for the new user and Benedict Cumberbatch:\n\nNow, let’s use a PowerShell script to create ten similar Active Directory accounts in bulk. They will all have nearly the same username, except for a number at the end that is incremented for each user. We will set the same default password (P@ssw0rd) for each of them, sending it in a protected state by using the ConvertTo-SecureString parameter. Here’s the script to use and the first two users that it creates:\n\nNow let’s make our script more flexible by adding the Read-Host parameter, which will prompt us for the stem username to use and the number of users to be created:\n\nCreate Users in Bulk with a CSV Import using PowerShell\n\nAnother option for creating users in bulk is to import their attributes from a CSV file. This option is great when you have a list of users with predefined personal details such as their name, department, and OU.\n\nThe CSV file must be in UTF8 encoding and look like this:\n\nThe following script will create enabled user objects for any users in the CSV that do not already have accounts in Active Directory. The “Reset password at the next logon” option will be enabled for the new accounts, so you can use your default password:\n\nAfter executing the script, we have two new users, Edward Franklin and Bill Jackson, in our Active Directory domain:\n\nOften, users need to be created on a daily or weekly basis. Suppose your HR department provides you with the details for each user in a CSV file that looks like this:\n\nTo create users from this file, we first import the CSV file into the variable $import_users, with each record as a separate line:\n\nThen we create the users using the script below. Note that it takes each user’s password from the source file, converts it into a secure string and encrypts it.\n\nWe can use the following command to review the new users and their properties:\n\nHow Netwrix Can Help with Creating Users in Active Directory\n\nUser provisioning is a never-ending task. Every day, organizations need to:\n• Update user accounts as users change their names, switch departments and so on.\n• Add users to and remove users from security groups to ensure they have the right permissions.\n• Deprovision and disable accounts when users leave the organization.\n\nMoreover, to ensure strong security and user productivity, all of these tasks need to be completed accurately, reliably and promptly.\n\nNetwrix GroupID simplifies group and user management for Active Directory, Azure AD, and Microsoft 365. In particular, you can provision and deprovision AD users through an automated, bi-directional data sync with your HR systems, such as SQL or Oracle databases. .Let’s look at a few screenshots depicting the Synchronize GUI.\n• The following screenshot shows the providers that can be used as a data source in a Synchronize job.\n• The following screenshot shows that Active Directory is selected as the destination provider for creating user, contact, mailbox, and external mail-enabled user objects. As a source provider, we can use simple (e.g., text or CSV) to complex (e.g., Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle Server) data stores.\n• The following screenshot shows that you can choose to create different objects (such as mailbox-enabled users, mail-enabled users, and contacts) at the destination. You can also update these objects at the destination when there is a change in the source provider.\n• The Create option button enables you to create the respective objects at the destination.\n• The Skip option button enables you to update the respective objects at the destination.\n\nNow that you have seen how to create users in Active Directory using PowerShell, try out the commands and scripts shown here in your own environment, and explore the many other parameters of the New -ADUser cmdlet.\n\nThen be sure to check out Netwrix GroupID. It combines the benefits of ADAC and PowerShell by offering a user-friendly GUI for performing and automating your user provisioning and deprovisioning tasks.\n\nQ: What is new-ADUser in Active Directory?\n\nA: New-ADUser is a PowerShell command for creating an Active Directory user.\n\nQ: How do I use the new-ADUser PowerShell cmdlet?\n\nA: To use New-ADUser, specify as many parameters as you need, as in this sample command:\n\nQ: How do I create a new user in Active Directory?\n\nA: You can create a new user easily using Active Directory Users and Computers, but you might not be able to populate all the user properties you need and you can’t create user accounts in bulk. A more powerful and flexible alternative is PowerShell. Here is an example of how you can use the New-ADUser cmdlet to create a user in Active Directory and populate many common attributes:\n\nQ: How can I create 1,000 users in Active Directory?\n\nA: You can use the PowerShell cmdlet New-ADUser to create many user accounts based on a CSV file containing the details for each user. An even easier option is to use Netwrix GroupID, which provides an easy-to-use wizard and accepts input from not just CSV files but SQL Server and Oracle databases."

PowerShell offers multiple ways to not only create a single user but to create Active Directory user objects in bulk. The CMDlet New-ADUser doesn’t have many mandatory parameters but you can use optional parameters while creating a new user.\n• Using the OtherAttributes parameter, you can change property values that are not related to cmdlet parameters. The attribute name needs to be enclosed in single quotes when using this parameter.\n• To create a user, you must give the SamAccountName parameter.\n• The container or organizational unit (OU) for the new user is specified using the Path parameter. When the Path option is not used, the cmdlet creates a user object in the domain’s default user object container. The following techniques describe various ways to build an object using this cmdlet:\n• With the New-ADUser command, use the OtherAttributes parameter to specify the parameters and values and to set any additional values.\n• A new user can be created from a template.

The following shows examples of the different parameters that can be used: Below are the descriptions of parameters used in the above CMDlet: Select the authentication type when running the command Prevent the account owner from changing the password (usually used for service accounts) Force the user to change the account password at the next login Specify the city for the user account Specify the company for the user account Get a confirmation prompt to run the cmdlet Specify the country for the user account Specify a description for the user account Specify the display name of the account Create a user account based on an existing account, such as one with the same department and title properties as the account you are creating Specify the manager of the user account Specify the office attribute of the user account Specify the value for an attribute for which there is no corresponding parameter in the cmdlet, such as the extensionAttribute1 to 15 attributes Force the account’s password to never expire Specify that the account, such as a service account, does not require a password Specify the OU path to create the user account in Specify the account’s SAMAccountName attribute, a logon name used to support clients and servers running earlier versions of Windows, such as Windows NT 4.0, Windows 95 or LAN Manager Connect to an alternate DC while running the command Specify the user’s US state Specify the user object’s type, such as a normal user or an inetOrgPerson user Specify the account’s userPrincipalName (UPN), which is typically the name that the user will use to log on/td>\n\n See what the output of the cmdlet would be without actually running it After executing the command, PowerShell will ask for the password. Enter the password and the user will be created.\n\nBefore creating the bulk users through PowerShell using the Import-CSV CMDlet, you will need to create a CSV file. The following is an example of the CSV file required: Now, execute the following command to create bulk users in AD. The Import-CSV provides pipeline input to the New-ADUser CMDlet. It processes the values of the CSV file to create the new users. Executing this command will load the Active Directory module first. After completing the action, you’ll return to the same prompt.\n\nExamples where Users would be Created with PowerShell Here are some examples of where you may want to use PowerShell to add user accounts:\n• Create a user and set attributes not covered by the cmdlet’s parameters.\n• Create a new user based on an existing AD user.\n• Create users in bulk by importing their attributes from a CSV file. Specify only the account name. The simplest example is creating a new user account by specifying only its name attribute: Running this will create the user but won’t show any output. To check whether the user was added successfully, we can list all Active Directory users using the following: However, the user we just created has more attributes than just a name; the following attributes are set by default:\n• The account is created in the ‘Users’ container.\n• The account is a member of the Domain Users group.\n• The user must reset the password at the first logon. Note that many attributes are not populated including the password attribute meaning that no password is set To resolve this, we can a new account that is usable by specifying more attributes: The Read-Host parameter will ask you to input a new password. Note that the password should meet the length, complexity and history requirements of your domain security policy. Let’s now see the results by running the following cmdlet: To create a user account with even more attributes, use the following command: To see a few of the new user’s attributes, use the following:\n\nUse the Set-ADUser CMDlet to modify the user in AD. Some of the available parameters for this CMDlet are listed below. Specifies the location of the user in the Active Directory. Its value can be in the following format.-Identity “CN=Username,CN=Users,DC=www,DC=doc,DC=com” Specifies whether the account password will never expire. Specifies whether a password is required or not. Specifies the SAM Account name of the user. Specifies the workstations, on which the user can logon. Its values have to be provided in the following format.-LogonWorkstations “workstation1,workstation2.www.domain.com”\n\nYou can reset the password of a user with Set-ADAccountPassword CMDlet. Some of the acceptable parameters for this CMDlet are listed below. Specifies the location of the user in the Active Directory. Its value can be in the following format.-Identity “CN=Username,CN=Users,DC=www,DC=doc,DC=com” Both OldPassword and NewPassword have to be provided as the Secure String, therefore, their values should be in the following format. After executing the command, PowerShell will ask for the new password. Enter the new password and hit Enter key to apply the change.\n\nMost user objects in Active Directory have the class of user. But you can also create user objects with the class inetOrgPerson, which has user as a parent class. The inetOrgPerson class facilitates integration with certain applications and simplifies the migration of certain user objects into Active Directory. To create an inetOrgPerson user account, simply include the -Type parameter and specify inetOrgPerson as its value:"

        "document": "Creating new users in the Active Directory is a common task for system administrators. You can do this manually in the ADUC, but a better and faster way is to use the New-ADUser cmdlet in PowerShell.\n\nThis cmdlet allows you to create a new user with all the required properties. I prefer to use an onboarding script to create new users. This allows you not only to create the user but also assign groups and licenses for example.\n\nIn this article, we will look at how to use the New-ADUser cmdlet and I will explain how you can create your own PowerShell script to create new users, including a free script to start with.\n\nTo create a new AD user with PowerShell you will need to have the Active Directory PowerShell module installed. This module is installed by default on the domain controllers, but you can also install it on your own workstation. Check out this article for more information on how to install it.\n\nThe New-ADUser cmdlet comes with a lot of options. We can basically set every property of the user while we create a new account. Now you don’t need to specify every property, you could even create a new user account by just specifying the name:\n\nBut this will create the user account in the default Users OU, without any attributes. So this is not really a realistic option.\n\nIn the example below, we have hardcoded the information, but we can also use a Read-Host cmdlet to make it a bit more dynamic of course. I recommend using a hashtable and splatting to make the code a bit more readable:\n\nNormally when you create a user account, you also want to enter details like contact information, which can be used in email signatures, for example, the manager of the user and probably group memberships.\n\nThe cmdlet allows you to specify all the properties that you need when creating a user account. You can for example enter all the address details and phone numbers of the user by adding the related parameters:\n\nThe cmdlet allows you to enter the commonly used parameters directly, but a user account in the Active Directory also can have extension or custom attributes. These can also be populated through PowerShell, by using the parameter.\n\nTo enter information in the extensionattribute1, for example, we can add the following parameter:\n\nAdding the manager to a user account in the Active Directory allows you, but also your users, to see a person’s manager and the manager’s direct reports in organization views for example. To add a manager to a new user account we first need to get the from the manager.\n\nThe easiest option is to find the manager based on the full name. This way we can simply add the SamAccountName to the manager parameter when creating a new account:\n\nInstead of supplying all the properties when creating a new user account, we can also use an existing user account as a template. This way we only need to supply the properties that are changing and don’t need to reenter the address information or group membership for example.\n\nThe first step is to get the user account that you want to use as a template. You will need to specify which properties you want to copy by using the parameter.\n\nNext, we are going to create a new user account. We will need to supply the minimum information that I mentioned before in the article, including the OU (Path). You can then use the -Instance parameter to specify the template user where you want to copy the information from:\n\nEven though this method does sound nice, I don’t really like it. You still need to supply the main information and select every field you want to copy. It’s better to spend some time creating a proper script that will do the most work for you.\n\nWhen you need to create new user accounts quite often, it’s best to spend some time and create a good PowerShell script. The advantage of using a script is that you can automate every step that needs to be taken to fully onboard a new user.\n\nEvery organization is different, so I don’t think my script will work for you out of the box. This means that you will need to modify the script to your needs. That’s why I will first explain what the script exactly does, and explain some of the important steps. You can then download the script and modify it.\n\nSo when creating a new user account, we need the following to be done:\n• Get the personal details of the new user. We only need the name, phone number, job title, company (in case of multiple offices) and manager\n• Get address information etc from a config file\n• Copy the group membership from an existing user that has the same job title, and works for the same company\n• Force the Microsoft Entra Sync (if you have a hybrid environment)\n• Send an email to the manager that the account has been created\n\nAs you can see in the steps above, we are using a config file. This is nothing more than a JSON file with all the static information. It allows us to define multiple branch offices, each with its own address information. We also use it to define some of the settings, like passwords.\n\nAs you can see in the JSON, we are also defining two mail templates and an attachment. The attachments are instructions on how to get started, what they need to know, etc.\n\nThe first step is to get the personal information of the new user. The script is intended to create a single user at a time, but you could also modify it for bulk creating, using the Import-CSV cmdlet.\n\nWe are using a couple of Read-Host cmdlets, and using the Write-Host cmdlets to give some guides:\n\nIf you are working in a large environment you often have to deal with different branch offices or departments. In the JSON file, we can define multiple companies, each with their own address details, etc.\n\nWe want to select one of those companies. To do this, we are building a choice menu that allows the user (you), to select one of the options.\n\nThe last piece of information that we need is the manager of the user. We select the manager by simply searching for the manager’s name. This can be the first name, last name, or full name. Now there is always a chance that we find multiple users with the same name.\n\nWe deal with this problem in the function . I am not going to show the full code of the function here, you can check that here on Github, but if we find multiple users, then the script will create another choice menu, so you can select the correct manager.\n\nWith the information that we now have, we can create the SamAccountName and the UserPrincipalName. The SamAccountName has some requirements that we need to keep in mind. It can’t be longer than 20 characters for example, and you want to define your format.\n\nI prefer to keep the logon name (SamAccountName) the same format as in the email addresses. The current principal for the name is + . So for example:\n\nThe SamAccountName also has to be unique within the Active Directory. If the name already exists, it will create the following alternative:\n\nNow you can change this of course to match your environment.\n\nIf the SamAccountName is created, we can use the name to create the . This is SamAccountName + the company domain name.\n\nThe job title might look like a simple property, but we need to make sure that the job title exists within the OU that we are going to create the user. The reason for this is, that we are going to copy the group memberships later on based on the job title and OU of the user.\n\nSo we ask for the job title in the script and check if it exists in the function . This also prevents multiple variations (and typos) of the same title. If the script can’t find a matching job title, then it will return all job titles from the users within the same OU and allow you to select one.\n\nWith all the information collected, we can create the new user account. The script supports a test mode (WhatIf), so you can try it out without creating an actual user.\n\nThe function New-DomainUserAccount is a custom function, but it does nothing special. It uses a splatted hashtable, as I have shown you at the beginning of the article, and the cmdlet to create the user.\n\nWith the user account created, we need to set the group membership of the new user. The best way to do this is to copy it from an existing user which has the same job title and works for the same company (department/branch office).\n\nThe first step is to get the newly created user account and the user to copy from. The function will search the Active Directory for all users based on the job title and in the same OU. It will of course exclude the newly created user.\n\nIt only returns one user, selecting the last created account and asking for confirmation before it copies the group membership.\n\nA part of the process of creating a new user account is also to inform the manager that the account is created. You can expand this to even the HR department and helpdesk if needed.\n\nTo send the emails, we are using an email template, which is a HTML file with placeholders in it. We can get the contents of the HTML file and by using the string replace function in PowerShell, we can modify the content with the details of the new user account.\n\nThe last step is to force the Entra Connect Sync so that the new user account is immediately synced to Microsoft 365. Depending on where you are running the script, we can use the Start-AdSynSyncCyle cmdlet or use the Invoke-Command to run the command on the domain controller.\n\nCreating a new user account with the New ADUser cmdlet is pretty easy, but it does require entering a lot of information. Therefore the true power of this cmdlet comes when using it in an onboarding script.\n\nYou can use my script as a starting point for your own environment. Make sure that you run it in test mode the first couple of times. The script will output what it does, so you can check every step.\n\nHope you liked this article, if you have any questions, just drop a comment below."

        "document": "Now we are ready to begin iterating over each line of the CSV file. To do this we will use a ForEach loop, which will read the CSV as an array of objects that we use to access each column of each line. In this for loop, we will define each line as \"$user\". For example, to access the column \"Organizational Unit\", we would access it by calling $user.'Organizational Unit'.\n\nWhen it comes to formatting multiple columns together, we can wrap variables inside of the parenthesis \"$()\" sub expression operator. For example, we could combine the first name and last name into a single variable like so: We are going to use this logic to create a username in the first.last format based on the first and last name columns in our CSV:\n\nNow let's generate a secure password BASED on the information that we have in the spreadsheet. For example, let's make one in the following format: [First Name Initial] + [Last Name] + [Employee ID] + [Special Characters] For the special characters, we can just define them as \"!@#\". We already have the other information stored in our spreadsheet, so let's generate this password! To create an AD user password, we need to use the command \"ConvertTo-SecureString\". Inside of this we are going to use sub expression operators to combine the different columns of the CSV file like so: [Last Name] = $user.'Last Name' Since we are going to be wrapping this into a quote, we will need to use a sub expression operator to ensure we parse the data correctly... So it will look like this:\n\nYou will notice for -Enabled we used a System.Convert to convert that column to a boolean. This is because the New-ADUser command connot accept a string for -Enabled and it must be a boolean instead. We use the $([System.Convert]::ToBoolean() command to convert the value of our column from a string to a boolean. Now we just need to add logic to add the user to each group that we specified in the spreadsheet. We can do that by splitting the group column and then iterating with another foreach loop over each split value:"

For the past hour and a half, I’ve tried importing the .csv file into Active Directory using a Power Shell script I made, but the script looks like it runs, but it doesn’t actually do anything. I’ll be the first to admit that I’m not the best at scripting, so if anyone can take a look at my script and/or .csv file, that would be awesome!\n\nAlso, is there a way in the Power Shell script that I can generate a user’s logon name as well? I tried to do it in the script, but I’m not sure if it’s correct."
