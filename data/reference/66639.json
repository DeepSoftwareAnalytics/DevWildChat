Also, I'm not quite sure what the means. I mean the range is from -29.5 to 29.5 with step 1. When I set this to 0.1 or 0.01 my pulse is better. Why does this affect my output?\n\nNote that the second thing I have to do is to create a periodic sequence of clock pulses. I don't know if this affects the way I must implement my initial rectangular pulse."
