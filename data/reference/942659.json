        "document": "This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other. Use the Get-Mailbox cmdlet to view mailbox objects and attributes, populate property pages, or supply mailbox information to other tasks. Note: In Exchange Online PowerShell, we recommend that you use the Get-EXOMailbox cmdlet instead of this cmdlet. For more information, see Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell. For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see Exchange cmdlet syntax.\n\nWhen you use the Get-Mailbox cmdlet in on-premises Exchange environments to view the quota settings for a mailbox, you first need to check the value of the UseDatabaseQuotaDefaults property. The value True means per-mailbox quota settings are ignored, and you need to use the Get-MailboxDatabase cmdlet to see the actual values. If the UseDatabaseQuotaDefaults property is False, the per-mailbox quota settings are used, so what you see with the Get-Mailbox cmdlet are the actual quota values for the mailbox. You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet.\n\nThis parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange. The Arbitration switch specifies whether to return only arbitration mailboxes in the results. You don't need to specify a value with this switch. Arbitration mailboxes are system mailboxes that are used for storing different types of system data and for managing messaging approval workflow. To return arbitration mailboxes that are used to store audit log settings or data, don't use this switch. Instead, use the AuditLog or AuxAuditLog switches.\n\nThis parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange. The Credential parameter specifies the username and password that's used to run this command. Typically, you use this parameter in scripts or when you need to provide different credentials that have the required permissions. A value for this parameter requires the Get-Credential cmdlet. To pause this command and receive a prompt for credentials, use the value . Or, before you run this command, store the credentials in a variable (for example, ) and then use the variable name ( ) for this parameter. For more information, see Get-Credential.\n\nThis parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange. The Server parameter filters the results by Exchange server. When you use this parameter, only mailboxes on the specified Exchange server are included in the results. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the server. For example: You can't use this parameter with the Anr, Database, or Identity parameters. The ServerName and ServerLegacyDN properties for a mailbox may not be updated immediately after a mailbox move within a database availability group (DAG). To get the most up-to-date values for these mailbox properties, run the command . Note: The result from this parameter could be a legacy value before migration. For better results, use the Database parameter instead.\n\nThe SortBy parameter specifies the property to sort the results by. You can sort by only one property at a time. The results are sorted in ascending order. If the default view doesn't include the property you're sorting by, you can append the command with . to create a new view that contains all of the properties that you want to see. Wildcards (*) in the property names are supported. You can sort by the following properties:"

        "document": "The Get-Mailbox cmdlet is a key command in the Exchange Management Shell (for Exchange Server) and in the Exchange Online PowerShell module (for Office 365). It is used to retrieve information about mailboxes in an Exchange environment. Whether you are dealing with user mailboxes, linked mailboxes, shared mailboxes, or resource mailboxes, with Get-Mailbox administrators can list all mailboxes within a specified scope, such as a database, server, or organizational unit, or retrieve detailed properties for a single mailbox. You can also filter results to return only the mailboxes that meet specific criteria.\n\nThe PowerShell Get-Mailbox cmdlet supports many parameters which can be used to customize the information returned. Parameters like -Properties allow for a comprehensive detail of mailbox attributes. The output of Get-Mailbox can be easily exported to CSV or JSON formats, facilitating integration with other tools and platforms. The Get-Mailbox cmdlet also provides the flexibility of PowerShell scripting in Exchange environments.\n\nAvailability in both on-premises Exchange and cloud-based service\n\nThe Get-Mailbox PowerShell cmdlet is available in both on-premises Exchange Server environments and Exchange Online (Office 365), though there are differences in implementation and available features. Introduced as part of Exchange Management Shell in Exchange Server 2007.\n\nGet-Mailbox is available in Exchange Server 2010, 2013, 2016, and 2019. Get-Mailbox is used via the Exchange Management Shell (EMS) in on-premises Exchange or via PowerShell loading the Exchange module. It includes parameters for filtering by database, organizational unit, recipient type, and more. Outputs various mailbox properties such as name, email address, and mailbox database.\n\nGet-Mailbox via PowerShell can be used for Exchange Online, which is accessed via remote PowerShell connections. This module provides cloud-based management capabilities and is accessed remotely. Like on-premises Exchange but may include additional parameters or features optimized for the cloud environment. Output includes properties relevant to cloud management.\n\nRecommendation for using Get-EXOMailbox cmdlet in Exchange Online\n\nThe Get-EXOMailbox cmdlet is part of the Exchange Online PowerShell module and is used to retrieve information about mailboxes in Exchange Online (part of Office 365). This cmdlet is an alternative to Get-Mailbox with enhancements for Exchange Online. Get-EXOMailbox is optimized for cloud environments and may provide better performance and additional features designed for Office 365. This cmdlet offers more advanced filtering and querying options that are specifically useful in a cloud-based setup and is better integration with other Office 365 services and features.\n• When working in Exchange Online, use Get-EXOMailbox rather than Get-Mailbox for optimized performance and cloud-specific features.\n• Use the -Filter parameter to efficiently retrieve subsets of mailboxes based on specific criteria, reducing the load and improving query performance.\n• For large organizations, use -ResultSize Unlimited to ensure you capture all relevant mailboxes. Be mindful of performance implications with very large data sets.\n• Use Get-EXOMailbox into PowerShell scripts for automated reporting, management, and maintenance tasks in Exchange Online.\n\nThe Get-Mailbox cmdlet in Exchange Server and Exchange Online is used to retrieve detailed information about mailboxes. The cmdlet does not modify any data, its primary function is to gather and display mailbox properties and configurations, this includes data about mailbox sizes, quotas, the number of items, last accessed time, and much more. The cmdlet provides flexibility in targeting specific mailboxes, sets of mailboxes, or all mailboxes, depending on the parameters used.\n\nThe Get-Mailbox cmdlet retrieves information about mailboxes, including user mailboxes, shared mailboxes, resource mailboxes (like room, shared and equipment mailboxes), and others. It provides details such as mailbox properties, location, and configuration.\n\nGenerate lists of mailboxes for reporting purposes, such as auditing mailbox types, locations, and attributes. Retrieve details needed for mailbox management tasks, like configuring mailbox settings or performing bulk operations. Help diagnose issues by providing mailbox-specific information related to configurations, quotas, and more.\n\nWhen you execute the Get-Mailbox cmdlet, it queries the Exchange directory services, Active Directory in on-premises environments, or Exchange Online directory in Office 365, to retrieve mailbox information. The cmdlet fetches data from the mailbox database or directories and presents it based on the specified parameters. This includes properties like email addresses, mailbox sizes, and more.\n\nBy default, Get-Mailbox displays a set of common properties such as DisplayName, PrimarySmtpAddress, Database, and Recipient Type. The output can be customized using the Select-Object to display additional or specific properties.\n\nParameters like -Identity, -Database, -OrganizationalUnit, and -Filter allow you to narrow down the search to specific mailboxes or sets of mailboxes based on criteria such as database location, organizational unit, or custom attributes. -ResultSize lets you control the number of results returned, which is helpful for managing performance and focusing on relevant subsets of data. Get-Mailbox supports many other parameters for more tasks.\n\nSpecific permissions are required to run the Get-Mailbox cmdlet in Exchange Server and Exchange Online. These permissions determine who can execute the cmdlet to retrieve mailbox information. These permissions are typically assigned through role-based access control (RBAC) in Exchange. These roles typically include “Recipient Management,” “Organization Management” or “View-Only Organization Management.” Below is a detailed overview of the permissions required for running the Get-Mailbox cmdlet.\n\nIn an on-premises Exchange Server environment, permissions typically granted through role-based access control (RBAC). RBAC roles can be assigned at several scopes, from organization-wide to specific mailbox databases.\n\nFor general mailbox management, including running Get-Mailbox, users are typically added to the “Recipient Management” role group. This role group includes roles that allow for creating, managing, and removing mailboxes, among other recipient-related tasks.\n\nFor high level administrative privileges, including the ability to run all mailbox-related cmdlets, the “Organization Management” role group can be used, that grant permissions across the entire Exchange organization.\n\nThis role provides read-only access to organizational settings, including the ability to run Get-Mailbox but without the ability to modify settings.\n\nYou can also create custom roles that specifically include the Get-Mailbox cmdlet, customizing the permissions to specific needs without granting broader access than necessary.\n\nIn Exchange Online for Get-Mailbox, permissions are similarly managed through RBAC, part of the overall Office 365 permissions structure, all above mentioned roles for on-premises Exchange server are also available, but there are some more high-level roles mentioned below, which also have permissions to run Get-Mailbox cmdlet.\n\nUsers with the Global Administrator role have the permissions to run Get-Mailbox alongside other administrative cmdlets across the entire Exchange Online organization.\n\nSpecific to Exchange Online, the Exchange Administrator role provides necessary permissions to manage Exchange settings, objects management, including executing Get-Mailbox.\n\nOffice 365 allows for the creation of customized administrator roles, like Exchange on-premises. A custom role can include the Get-Mailbox cmdlet specifically, along with any other required cmdlets, offering precise control over permissions.\n\nThe most straightforward use of the Get-Mailbox cmdlet is to get all mailboxes using PowerShell. The cmdlet returns a summary list of all mailboxes when used without any parameters, including primary attributes like DisplayName, Alias, ServerName, ProhibitSendQuota, and others depending on the environment.\n\nThe general structure of the Get-Mailbox with several parameters is as follows.\n\nBelow is general syntax with one parameter\n\nThe following are commonly used Get-Mailbox parameters:\n\nLet’s look at each of them\n\nThe -Identity parameter specifies the mailbox to be retrieved. It can accept several forms of identifiers such as the mailbox GUID, Distinguished Name (DN), Domain\\Username, User Principal Name (UPN), Legacy Exchange DN, SMTP address, or Alias. This parameter can be used to quickly access information about a specific mailbox.\n\nThe -Filter parameter allows for more complex queries. It is used to define conditions that pinpoint the exact set of mailboxes you are interested in, based on attributes such as department, custom attributes, or mailbox size.\n\nThe -Database parameter filters mailboxes based on the database in which they are stored. It is useful for operations targeting specific databases, such as during migrations or for database-specific reporting.\n\nThe -OrganizationalUnit parameter narrows down the search to mailboxes located within a specific Active Directory organizational unit. This is particularly handy in large organizations with a structured OU hierarchy.\n\nThe -Arbitration switch parameter retrieves arbitration mailboxes, which are system mailboxes used for storing organizational data, such as administrator audit logs, eDiscovery information, and other system-related tasks.\n\nThe -AuditLog switch parameter is used to retrieve audit log mailboxes, which contain audit logs for actions taken by administrators and users. This is important for compliance and monitoring purposes.\n\nThis parameter allows filtering of the mailboxes based on their type, such as UserMailbox, SharedMailbox, RoomMailbox, or EquipmentMailbox, among others. It facilitates operations aimed specifically at managing particular types of mailboxes.\n\nThe -ResultSize parameter limits the number of results returned by the cmdlet. By default, Get-Mailbox retrieves up to 1000 mailboxes. Setting this parameter to “Unlimited” allows fetching details for all mailboxes without truncation or setting it to a less number e.g. 50 will bring results according to value provided.\n\nRetrieve mailboxes that have been soft deleted but not permanently removed, this parameter is only available for Exchange Online (Office365).\n\nThe -Anr (Ambiguous Name Resolution) parameter is used in conjunction with the -Identity parameter to search for a mailbox where the specified string is close or similar to the actual identity of the mailbox. It is helpful when the exact name or alias of the mailbox is not known.\n\nThis parameter specifies the property by which the results should be sorted. For instance, using -SortBy DisplayName, organizes the returned mailbox list alphabetically by the display name of the mailboxes.\n\nLike other cmdlets in PowerShell Get-Mailbox supports common parameters like -Verbose, -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -WarningAction, -WarningVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, and -OutVariable. These parameters can help control cmdlet messaging, handle errors and warnings, and manage output in scripts and functions.\n\nOther Parameters available for cmdlet\n\nYou can combine multiple parameters to refine your query. Following are some examples.\n• Below cmdlet retrieves all user mailboxes in a specific database with recipient type as “user”.\n• Below cmdlet will get all the mailboxes with a specific custom attribute, with all the results using -ResultSize.\n\nBy piping the Get-Mailbox cmdlet output into the Select-Object cmdlet, below example cmdlets retrieves customized list showing the display name, primary SMTP address, and send quota for each mailbox from a specific OU. This format is particularly useful for generating reports or audits.\n• Retrieve mailboxes in a specific OU and show only their display names and email addresses.\n• More complex example shown below, combines multiple cmdlets to identify mailboxes that have not been accessed in the last 90 days.\n\nGet-Mailbox combined with its parameters, enables a wide range of uses and scenarios that can facilitate effective email system management, compliance, reporting, and troubleshooting. Below are some use cases and scenarios.\n\nGenerating reports on mailbox sizes, quotas, and usage to ensure compliance with organizational policies. Below cmdlet does not produce any results, you can go to the location provided in Export-CSV cmdlet and open the CSV file, it will look like below screenshot.\n\nFinding mailboxes that have not been accessed for a specific period, which might indicate inactive or orphaned mailboxes. This scenario helps in cleaning up the mail system, potentially freeing up resources and licenses by identifying mailboxes that are no longer in use.\n\nListing mailboxes with certain configurations, such as forwarding enabled or specific mailbox features.\n\nPerform bulk operations, such as moving mailboxes or applying mailbox settings to multiple mailboxes at once. Move all mailboxes from one database to another as part of a maintenance task.\n\nFinding all shared or delegate mailboxes and reviewing their delegated users for audit purposes.\n\nIf you want to set send and receive quota according to your need, below cmdlet will be able set the quota with value of 5GB, you can use your own value as required.\n\nAbove cmdlet will not produce any output but will set the value, you can use the below cmdlet to check the desired output you set using above cmdlet.\n\nDiagnose and troubleshoot issues related to mailboxes, such as identifying mailboxes with exceeded quotas. Identify mailboxes that have exceeded their send quotas to address potential performance issues.\n\nManage mailboxes within a specific organizational unit (OU), such as applying specific settings or configurations. Retrieve and apply a configuration change to all mailboxes in the “HR” OU.\n\nAbove cmdlet will not produce any results but will assign the value for maximum send size for messages, for all users within the OU specified, use the below cmdlet to confirm.\n\nDelegate access to mailboxes for administrative or support purposes. Grant full access permissions to a support mailbox for all mailboxes in a specific mailbox database.\n\nChecking mailbox quota settings is important, as it helps ensure that users do not exceed the storage limits set by the organization, potentially impacting email functionality.\n\nMailbox quotas are used to limit the amount of storage space a mailbox can use. These quotas include as below.\n• Issue Warning Quota: The threshold at which users are warned that their mailbox is approaching its storage limit.\n• Prohibit Send Quota: The threshold at which users are prevented from sending new messages.\n• Prohibit Send and Receive Quota: The threshold at which users are prevented from sending or receiving new messages.\n\nTo check the quota settings for a specific mailbox, you can use the Get-Mailbox cmdlet followed by the mailbox identity. This will return various properties of the mailbox, including the quota settings.\n\nIf you need to review the quota settings across multiple or all mailboxes within your environment, you can use the Get-Mailbox cmdlet without specifying an identity and output the relevant quota properties, and exports the data to a CSV file, making it easier to analyze and report on quota configurations.\n\nTo return a summary list of all mailboxes in Exchange Online or Exchange Server using PowerShell, use the below cmdlet.\n\nBelow command will output a table to your PowerShell console containing a summary of all mailboxes with their display names, aliases, UPNs, creation dates, and primary email addresses. This summary provides a quick overview, useful for reports, audits, or simply getting an insight into the mailboxes currently established in your Exchange environment.\n\nBelow cmdlet will use some more properties e.g. Database, ProhibitSendQuota, ProhibitSendReceiveQuota, IssueWarningQuota, along with display name and primary smtp address.\n\nTo return a summary list of archive mailboxes located within a specific database using PowerShell in Exchange Online or Exchange Server, you can use a combination of the “Get-Mailbox and” and “Get-MailboxStatistics” cmdlets. This combination allows you to filter mailboxes by their hosting database and then check each for an archive. Below is how you can accomplish this.\n\nCombining the Get-Mailbox cmdlet with other PowerShell cmdlets like Get-Member, Select-Object, and Format-List can help you retrieve, view, and format mailbox information more effectively.\n\nThe Get-Member cmdlet is used to inspect the properties and methods of objects returned by Get-Mailbox. This is particularly useful for discovering which properties are available for selection or formatting.\n\nThe Select-Object cmdlet allows you to specify which properties you want to include in your output. This is useful for creating a tailored view of mailbox information.\n\nThe Format-List cmdlet formats output as a list, showing all properties and their values. This is useful for a detailed view of a mailbox object’s properties.\n\nYou want to update mailbox settings for multiple mailboxes, such as setting a specific mailbox quota or enabling/disabling archiving.\n\nBelow command finds all mailboxes in “Test3” and sets their quota settings. It updates the ProhibitSendQuota, ProhibitSendReceiveQuota, and IssueWarningQuota for each mailbox.\n\nWhen working with large sets of information, you can narrow down the dataset to exactly what you need, and sorting helps organize the output for better analysis or reporting. Below cmdlets will show how to use filtering and sorting mechanisms with Get-Mailbox.\n\nFiltering cmdlets allow you to specify criteria to include only the objects that match those criteria in the command’s output, you can apply filters directly in cmdlets that support the -Filter parameter or use the “Where-Object” cmdlet for more complex or unsupported filtering scenarios.\n\nSorting helps in organizing your data in a meaningful order, making it easier to read and analyze. You can use the “Sort-Object” cmdlet for sorting purposes. This command retrieves all mailboxes and sorts them alphabetically by their display name.\n\nTo export results to a CSV file, PowerShell offers the “Export-Csv” cmdlet, which takes input from the pipeline and writes it to a specified CSV file. For example, if you want to export a list of Exchange mailboxes along with their sizes and usage details, you can use the below cmdlet. You need to specify the path and filename for your CSV file in -Path parameter.\n\nGrouping and formatting results significantly enhance the readability of your data output. PowerShell provides cmdlets such as Group-Object, Format-Table, Format-List, etc., which can be used for these purposes.\n\nThe Group-Object cmdlet is for categorizing objects based on property values. This can be particularly useful for sorting mailboxes by attributes, like department or custom attributes.\n\nAfter the data is grouped or when presenting any data, proper formatting can make the output more accessible. Format-Table, often abbreviated as “ft”, displays data in a table format. It is ideal for when you want to see your results in columns. You can specify the properties to display and even control the column width.\n\nFormat-List, abbreviated as “fl”, displays each property of an object on a new line, making it suitable for detailed viewing of fewer objects or when the object has many properties that would not fit well in a table.\n\nGet-Mailbox cmdlet behaves slightly differently in Exchange online compared to its usage in on-premises Exchange. These differences are primarily from the cloud-based architecture of Exchange Online and the multi-tenant setup, which impacts how administrators interact with mailboxes and the scope of the cmdlets. Below are some key differences.\n• In Exchange Online, cmdlet operations can be subject to throttling to maintain overall service performance, might take longer or require batch processing in larger environments to avoid throttling limits.\n• Exchange Online includes more recipient types and details to accommodate the variety of services in Office 365, you might encounter recipient types that are specific to the cloud environment that do not exist in on-premises Exchange.\n• Some properties and attributes available in on-premises Exchange might not be present or accessible in Exchange Online due to the nature of the hosted environment. Exchange Online mailboxes might have additional properties related to the cloud environment, like licensing information and mailbox plans.\n• The default output in Exchange Online is different for cloud management, providing information more relevant to cloud administrators. The set of properties displayed by default and the built-in filters might differ from those in an on-premises Exchange.\n• Due to the multi-tenant architecture of Exchange Online, the scope of Get-Mailbox is limited to the organization’s mailboxes. In a hybrid environment, to manage on-premises mailboxes, administrators need to use the on-premises Exchange Management Shell.\n• Exchange Online integrates closely with other Office 365 services, offering advanced security and compliance features. The behavior of Get-Mailbox might reflect these integrations, such as flags or properties related to litigation hold, eDiscovery, or Advanced Threat Protection.\n\nUsing Get-EXOMailbox for better performance\n\nGet-EXOMailbox is a cmdlet designed for use in Exchange Online environments. It offers improved performance and specific functionalities to the cloud-based nature of Exchange Online compared to the traditional Get-Mailbox cmdlet. Get-EXOMailbox is optimized for faster execution over remote connections, making it more efficient for retrieving mailbox information from Exchange Online. Connection requires modern authentication, potentially including multi-factor authentication (MFA), depending on your environment’s configuration.\n\nBelow are a couple of examples showing how “Get-EXOMailbox” can be used for common administrative tasks.\n\nArchiving in Office 365 is a premium feature, I have used the ArchiveStatus to None to show the output as below, the above cmdlet will work if there will be mailboxes with archiving enabled.\n\nGet-Mailbox cmdlet includes parameters that are exclusive to Exchange Online or have relevance in a cloud-hosted environment compared to an on-premises Exchange Server setup. These exclusive parameters provide unique characteristics of managing mailboxes in the cloud, such as dealing with licensing, listing inactive mailboxes or retrieving soft deleted mailboxes.\n\nYou can choose whether to limit the results to only inactive mailboxes by using the -InactiveMailboxOnly parameter. This switch does not require a value to be specified.\n\nA mailbox that is put on litigation hold or in-place hold prior to being soft-deleted is considered inactive.\n\nThis parameter is filtering the mailboxes returned by the command to only those that are associated with a specific mailbox plan. This feature is especially useful in environments where multiple mailbox plans are in place, such as different plans for different departments or roles within an organization.\n\nThis parameter includes inactive mailboxes in the results. Inactive mailboxes are usually related to deleted or deprovisioned users but are retained for data retention purposes, especially important for compliance and eDiscovery.\n\nThis parameter includes mailboxes in the results that have been soft deleted. Soft deleted mailboxes occur when a mailbox is deleted through the Office 365 admin center or via PowerShell, but it is retained for a period to allow for recovery.\n\nWhen it comes to managing mailboxes in a Microsoft Exchange environment using Get-Mailbox cmdlet, adhering to best practices ensure optimal performance, security, and manageability. Below are some key best practices to consider.\n\nLimit the Scope of Your Queries\n\nUse filters to narrow down the results to only the mailboxes you are interested in. This reduces the load on your system and gets you the information more quickly. When running “Get-Mailbox”, especially in large environments, try to limit the scope of the command to the necessary mailboxes. Use parameters like “-RecipientTypeDetails” or “-OrganizationalUnit” to narrow down the results and reduce load on your Exchange server.\n\nWhenever possible, use cmdlet parameters that perform filtering on the server side instead of bringing all objects into memory and filtering client-side with “Where-Object”. This improves performance and efficiency. Leverage the “-Filter” parameter to perform server-side filtering. This approach is more efficient and reduces the amount of data transmitted over the network.\n\nBe cautious with the “-ResultSize Unlimited” parameter, especially in large environments. While it is necessary for comprehensive operations, it can lead to performance issues. Consider breaking down large operations into smaller chunks.\n\nBy default, Get-Mailbox retrieves a lot of properties for each mailbox, which may not always be necessary. Use the “-Properties” parameter to specify only the properties you need, or use “Select-Object” to trim down the results. This can significantly improve performance.\n\nWhen using wildcards (*) in filters, be aware that they can lead to performance issues if used excessively or inefficiently. Place wildcards carefully within your queries to ensure they are as efficient as possible.\n\nOften, “Get-Mailbox” is used in conjunction with other cmdlets for tasks such as mailbox modifications or reports. When piping “Get-Mailbox” into other cmdlets, ensure that the initial “Get-Mailbox” command is as targeted as possible to avoid unnecessary processing.\n\nThis parameter is incredibly useful for targeting specific types of mailboxes (e.g., UserMailbox, SharedMailbox, etc.). Understanding and using this parameter effectively can help in executing more precise operations.\n\nWhen running “Get-Mailbox” scripts or commands that might expose sensitive information, ensure that you are in compliance with your organization’s security policies. Limit access to these scripts and their output to authorized personnel only.\n\nBefore running a script that makes changes based on “Get-Mailbox” output, especially in a production environment, thoroughly test your script in a non-production environment. Validate the selection of mailboxes and the intended changes to avoid unintended impacts.\n\nAs your Exchange environment evolves, so too should your scripts and commands. Regularly review and update them to ensure they are using the most efficient methods and are aligned with current best practices.\n\nEnsure your PowerShell session or module for Exchange is up to date. Microsoft regularly updates PowerShell cmdlets for Exchange Online, introducing new features and improvements that can enhance your scripting capabilities.\n\nYou might encounter several issues or unexpected behaviors when working with Get-Mailbox cmdlet. Below are some common issues along with troubleshooting steps and solutions to resolve them effectively.\n\nYou may receive an error message indicating that “Get-Mailbox” is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.\n• Ensure you are running the cmdlet in the Exchange Management Shell (for Exchange Server) or have connected to Exchange Online PowerShell using “Connect-ExchangeOnline” (for Exchange Online).\n• For Exchange Online, ensure the Exchange Online PowerShell Module is installed and up to date.\n• Check your PowerShell session, you might be in a session that does not load the Exchange cmdlets by default.\n\nYou are connected to Exchange Online or Exchange Server but receiving permission-related errors when attempting to execute “Get-Mailbox”.\n• Verify the account you are using has the necessary permissions (e.g., Exchange Admin role for Exchange Online or appropriate RBAC roles in Exchange Server).\n• For Exchange Online, ensure that you have multi-factor authentication (MFA) set up correctly if your account requires it.\n• In Exchange Server, check that the account is explicitly granted access to use “Get-Mailbox” or added in a role that permit the operation, e.g. Recipient Management role.\n\nThe “Get-Mailbox” cmdlet executes without errors but returns incomplete or unexpected results.\n• Use the “-ResultSize” parameter to ensure all expected mailboxes are being queried. The default might not return all mailboxes.\n• Refine your query using the “-Filter” parameter to ensure it accurately reflects the criteria you want to apply.\n• Check if there are any server-side or client-side filtering options that might be limiting the results.\n• For Exchange Online, throttling policies can sometimes delay command execution, consider retrying after a brief interval.\n\nThe cmdlet takes a long time to execute, especially in environments with a large number of mailboxes.\n• Limit your query scope using “-ResultSize”, “-Filter”, or other specific parameters like “-OrganizationalUnit” to narrow down the results and improve performance.\n• Consider breaking down your task into smaller batches if you are processing a large number of mailboxes.\n• For Exchange Online, ensure you are using the latest version of the Exchange Online Management Module which is optimized for large datasets.\n\nYou experience connectivity issues when trying to use “Get-Mailbox” in Exchange Online.\n• Confirm that there are no ongoing service incidents affecting Exchange Online by checking the Office 365 Service Health dashboard.\n• Re-establish your PowerShell session to Exchange Online using “Connect-ExchangeOnline”, as session timeouts or network changes can disrupt connectivity.\n\nYou encounter restrictions related to PowerShell script execution policy when running scripts that include the “Get-Mailbox” cmdlet.\n• Use “Get-ExecutionPolicy” to check your current PowerShell execution policy.\n• If necessary, adjust the policy using “Set-ExecutionPolicy” with an appropriate level (e.g., RemoteSigned) that allows your script to run, considering the security implications.\n\nWhat does get-mailbox do?\n\nGet-Mailbox retrieve the mailbox information from an on-premises Exchange or Exchange Online (Office 365).\n\nWhat is the difference between get-mailbox and get-EXOMailbox?\n\nThe difference between Get-Mailbox and Get-EXOMailbox primarily relates to the environments they are used in and the type of mailboxes they target. Get-Mailbox is used in on-premises Exchange environments but can also be used with Exchange online. Get-EXOMailbox is specifically used in Exchange Online. It is part of the Exchange Online PowerShell module, which is specifically designed for managing Exchange Online.\n\nWhat is the get-mailbox statistics command?\n\nThe Get-MailboxStatistics command in PowerShell is used to retrieve statistical information about mailboxes in an Exchange environment. This command provides details such as, total item count, total size of the mailbox, last logon time etc. This command is useful for administrators to monitor mailbox usage and performance.\n\nHow to get-mailbox details in PowerShell?\n\nTo get mailbox details in PowerShell, you can use the Get-Mailbox command. This command allows you to retrieve several properties of mailboxes in both on-premises Exchange and Exchange Online environments.\n\nWhat is the command to get-mailbox database in PowerShell?\n\nTo get mailbox database details in PowerShell, you can use the Get-MailboxDatabase command in an on-premises Exchange environment. For Exchange Online, this command is not applicable since it operates differently.\n\nHow to get-mailbox folder list in PowerShell?\n\nTo get a list of mailbox folders in PowerShell, you can use the Get-MailboxFolderStatistics command. This command provides details about the folders within a specific mailbox, including their names, sizes, and item counts.\n\nHow do I get the properties of a mailbox in PowerShell?\n\nYou can use the Get-Mailbox to show all properties of a mailbox in an on-premises Exchange or the Exchange Online.\n\nThis will display all available properties for the specified mailbox."

PowerShell on your client computer doesn't need Basic authentication in WinRM.\n• More reliable: Transient failures use built-in retries, so failures or delays are minimized. For example:\n• Delays due to large queries that take a long time to complete.\n\nThe benefits of cmdlets in REST API connections are described in the following table:\n\nREST API cmdlets have the same cmdlet names and work just like their remote PowerShell equivalents, so you don't need to update cmdlet names or parameters in older scripts.\n\nBasic authentication (remote PowerShell) connections are deprecated in Exchange Online PowerShell and Security & Compliance PowerShell. For more information, see here and here.\n\nA few cmdlets in Exchange Online PowerShell have been updated with the experimental UseCustomRouting switch in REST API connections. This switch routes the command directly to the required Mailbox server, and might improve overall performance. Use the UseCustomRouting switch experimentally.\n• None When you use the UseCustomRouting switch, you can use only the following values for identity of the mailbox:\n• None The UseCustomRouting switch is available only on the following Exchange Online PowerShell cmdlets in REST API connections:\n• None Use the Get-ConnectionInformation cmdlet to get information about REST API connections to Exchange Online PowerShell and Security & Compliance PowerShell. This cmdlet is required because the Get-PSSession cmdlet in Windows PowerShell doesn't return information for REST API connections. Scenarios where you can use Get-ConnectionInformation are described in the following table: Run after Connect-ExchangeOnline or Connect-IPPSSession commands for REST API connections. Run after multiple Connect-ExchangeOnline or Connect-IPPSSession commands for REST API connections.\n• None Use the SkipLoadingFormatData switch on the Connect-ExchangeOnline cmdlet to avoid loading format data and to run Connect-ExchangeOnline commands faster.\n• None Cmdlets backed by the REST API have a 15-minute timeout, which can affect bulk operations. For example, the following Update-DistributionGroupMember command to update 10,000 members of a distribution group might time out: Instead, use the Update-DistributionGroupMember command to update fewer members, and then add the remaining members individually using an Add-DistributionGroupMember command. For example:\n\nFor more information about what's new in the EXO V3 module, see the Release notes section later in this article.\n\nReport bugs and issues for Preview versions of the Exchange Online PowerShell module\n\nFor Preview versions of the module, use to report any issues that you might encounter.

To generate the log files, replace <Path> with an output folder, and then run the following command:\n\nThe EXO module contains nine exclusive Get-EXO* cmdlets that are optimized for speed in bulk data retrieval scenarios (thousands and thousands of objects) in Exchange Online PowerShell. The improved cmdlets in the module are listed in the following table:\n\nThe connection-related cmdlets in the module are listed in the following table:\n\nMiscellaneous Exchange Online cmdlets that happen to be in the module are listed in the following table:\n\nYou download the module from the PowerShell gallery at https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ExchangeOnlineManagement/.\n\nThe procedures in this section explain how to install, update, and uninstall the module.\n\nThe latest versions of the module are officially supported in PowerShell 7 on Windows, Linux, and Apple macOS.\n\nSpecifically, version 2.0.4 or later is supported in PowerShell 7.0.3 or later.\n\nFor more information about PowerShell 7, see Announcing PowerShell 7.0.\n\nThe module is supported in the following versions of macOS:\n\nFor instructions on installing PowerShell 7 on macOS, see Installing PowerShell on macOS.\n\nAs described in the installation article, you need to install OpenSSL, which is required for WSMan.\n\nAfter you install PowerShell 7 and OpenSSL, do the following steps:\n• None In the PowerShell superuser session, run the following commands: If prompted, accept PSGallery as the source for the cmdlets.\n\nNow you can do the regular PowerShell prerequisites and install the Exchange Online PowerShell module.\n\nThe module is officially supported in the following distributions of Linux:\n\nFor instructions on installing PowerShell 7 on Linux, see Installing PowerShell on Linux.\n\nAfter you install PowerShell 7, do the following steps:\n• None In the PowerShell superuser session, run the following commands: If prompted, accept PSGallery as the source for the cmdlets.\n\nNow you can do the regular PowerShell prerequisites and install the Exchange Online PowerShell module.\n\nAll versions of the module are supported in Windows PowerShell 5.1.\n\nPowerShell 7 on Windows requires version 2.0.4 or later.\n\nVersion 2.0.5 or later of the module requires the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7.2 or later to connect. Otherwise, you get a error. This requirement shouldn't be an issue in current versions of Windows. For more information about versions of Windows that support the .NET Framework 4.7.2, see this article.\n\nWindows PowerShell requirements and module support in older versions of Windows are described in the following list:\n• None ¹ PowerShell 7 on this version of Windows requires the Windows 10 Universal C Runtime (CRT).\n• None ² Support for this version of Windows has ended, and is now supported only in Azure virtual machines.\n• None ³ This version of Windows supports only v2.0.3 or earlier versions of the module.\n• None ⁴ Windows PowerShell 5.1 on this version of Windows requires the .NET Framework 4.5 or later and the Windows Management Framework 5.1. For more information, see Windows Management Framework 5.1.\n\nPowerShell needs to be configured to run scripts, and by default, it isn't.

We don't send the username and password combination. The Basic authentication header is required to send the session's OAuth token, because the client-side implementation of WinRM doesn't support OAuth.\n\nTo verify that Basic authentication is enabled for WinRM, run the following command in a Command Prompt or Windows PowerShell:\n\nIf you don't see the value , you need to run one of the following commands to enable Basic authentication for WinRM:\n• None In Windows PowerShell to modify the registry:\n\nIf Basic authentication for WinRM is disabled, you get one of the following errors when you try to connect using a Basic authentication (remote PowerShell) connection:\n\nREST API connections in Windows require the PowerShellGet module, and by dependency, the PackageManagement module. Consideration for these modules is more for PowerShell 5.1 than PowerShell 7, but all versions of PowerShell benefit from having the latest versions of the modules installed. For installation and update instructions, see Installing PowerShellGet on Windows.\n\nIf you don't have PowerShellGet installed when you try to create a REST API connection, you get the following error when you try to connect:\n\nTo install the module for the first time, complete the following steps:\n• None Install or update the PowerShellGet module as described in Installing PowerShellGet.\n• None Now you can use the Install-Module cmdlet to install the module from the PowerShell Gallery.

This behavior causes degraded performance (more server computation and added network load). You rarely (if ever) need the full complement of properties in the cmdlet output.\n\nThe Get-EXO* cmdlets in the module have categorized output properties. Instead of giving all properties equal importance and returning them in all scenarios, we categorized specific related properties into property sets. These property sets are buckets of two or more related properties on the cmdlet.\n\nThe biggest and most used Get-EXO* cmdlets use property sets:\n\nIn those cmdlets, property sets are controlled by the following parameters:\n• PropertySets: This parameter accepts one or more available property set names separated by commas. The available property sets are described in Property sets in Exchange Online PowerShell module cmdlets.\n• Properties: This parameter accepts one or more property names separated by commas.\n\nYou can use the PropertySets and Properties parameters together in the same command.\n\nWe also included a Minimum property set that includes a bare minimum set of required properties for the cmdlet output (for example, identity properties). The properties in the Minimum property sets are also described in Property sets in Exchange Online PowerShell module cmdlets.\n• If you don't use the PropertySets or Properties parameters, you automatically get the properties in the Minimum property set.\n• If you use the PropertySets or Properties parameters, you get the specified properties and the properties in the Minimum property set.\n\nEither way, the cmdlet output contains far fewer properties, and the results are returned much faster.\n\nFor example, after you connect to Exchange Online PowerShell, the following example returns only the properties in the Minimum property set for the first 10 mailboxes.\n\nIn contrast, the output of the same Get-Mailbox command would return at least 230 properties for each of the first 10 mailboxes.\n\nFor more information about filtering in the module, see Filters in the Exchange Online PowerShell module.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the current release of the Exchange Online PowerShell module contains all features of previous releases.\n• Added a new property named to the output of Get-EXOMailbox that's similar to the property in the output of Get-Mailbox.\n• Added new cmdlets to support the Viva Org Insights Delegation feature:\n• Command line help for Exchange Online PowerShell cmdlets is no longer loaded by default. Use the LoadCmdletHelp parameter in the Connect-ExchangeOnline command so help for Exchange Online PowerShell cmdlets is available to the Get-Help cmdlet.\n• Fixed connection issues with app only authentication in Security & Compliance PowerShell.\n• Get-VivaModuleFeature now returns information about the kinds of identities that the feature supports creating policies for (for example, users, groups, or the entire tenant).\n• Added fix for compatibility issue with the Microsoft.Graph module.\n• The module has been upgraded to run on .NET 8, replacing the previous version based on .NET 6.\n• Added support for policy operations at the category level in Viva Feature Access Management (VFAM).\n• New IsFeatureEnabledByDefault property in the output of Get-VivaModuleFeaturePolicy. The value of this property shows the default enablement state for users in the tenant when no tenant or user/group policies were created.\n• The SigningCertificate parameter in Connect-ExchangeOnline now supports Constrained Language Mode (CLM).\n• SkipLoadingCmdletHelp parameter on Connect-ExchangeOnline to support skip loading cmdlet help files.\n• Global variable is available to check the status of the last cmdlet that was run.\n• IsUserControlEnabled parameter on Add-VivaModuleFeaturePolicy and Update-VivaModuleFeaturePolicy to support the enablement of user controls by policy for features that are onboarded to Viva feature access management.\n• SigningCertificate parameter on Connect-ExchangeOnline allows you to sign the format files (*.Format.ps1xml) or script module files (.psm1) in the temporary module that Connect-ExchangeOnline creates with a client certificate to use in all PowerShell execution policies.\n• Bug fix in Connect-IPPSSession for connecting to Security & Compliance PowerShell using CertificateThumbprint.\n• Features already described in the REST API connections in the EXO V3 module section:\n• Certificate based authentication for Security & Compliance PowerShell (version 2.0.6-Preview5 or later).\n• The Get-ConnectionInformation cmdlet for REST-based connections (version 2.0.6-Preview7 or later).\n• The SkipLoadingFormatData switch on the Connect-ExchangeOnline cmdlet for REST-based connections (version 2.0.6-Preview8 or later).\n• The DelegatedOrganization parameter works in the Connect-IPPSSession cmdlet as long as you also use the AzureADAuthorizationEndpointUri parameter in the command.\n• Certain cmdlets that used to prompt for confirmation in specific scenarios no longer do so. By default, the cmdlet runs to completion.\n• The format of the error returned from failed cmdlet execution is slightly modified. The exception now contains more data (for example, the exception type), and the doesn't contain the . The format of the error is subject to further modification.\n• None New Get-OwnerlessGroupPolicy and Set-OwnerlessGroupPolicy cmdlets to manage ownerless Microsoft 365 groups. Although the cmdlets are available in the module, the feature is only available to members of a Private Preview.\n• None New Get-VivaInsightsSettings and Set-VivaInsightsSettings cmdlets to control user access to Headspace features in Viva Insights.\n• None PowerShell 7 is officially supported in Windows, Linux, and Apple macOS as described in the Prerequisites for the Exchange Online PowerShell module section in this article.\n• None The module in PowerShell 7 supports browser-based single sign-on (SSO) and other sign in methods. For more information, see PowerShell 7 exclusive connection methods.\n• None The Get-UserAnalyticsConfig and Set-UserAnalyticsConfig cmdlets were replaced by the Get-MyAnalyticsConfig and Set-MyAnalyticsConfig. Additionally, you can configure access at feature level. For more information, see Configure MyAnalytics.\n• None Real-time policy and security enforcement in all user based authentication. Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE) is enabled in the module. Read more about CAE here.\n• None The LastUserActionTime and LastInteractionTime properties are now available in the output of the Get-EXOMailboxStatistics cmdlet.\n• None The interactive sign-in process now uses a more secure method to fetch access tokens using safe reply URLs.\n• General availability of certificate based authentication (CBA), which enables using modern authentication in unattended scripting or background automation scenarios. The available certificate storage locations are:\n• Remote in the Azure Key Value (the Certificate) parameter. This option enhances security by fetching the certificate only at runtime.\n• Local in the CurrentUser or LocalMachine certificate store (the CertificateThumbprint parameter).\n• Local in an exported certificate file (the CertificateFilePath and CertificatePassword parameters). For more information, see the parameter descriptions in Connect-ExchangeOnline and App-only authentication for unattended scripts in the Exchange Online PowerShell module.\n• Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell and Security & Compliance PowerShell simultaneously in a single PowerShell window.\n• The new CommandName parameter allows you to specify and restrict the Exchange Online PowerShell cmdlets that are imported in a session. This option reduces the memory footprint for high usage PowerShell applications.\n• Get-EXOMailboxFolderPermission now supports ExternalDirectoryObjectID in the Identity parameter.\n• Optimized latency of the first V2 cmdlet call. Lab results show the first call latency has been reduced from 8 seconds to approximately 1 second. Actual results depend on the cmdlet result size and the tenant environment.\n• General Availability (GA) version of the EXO V2 module. It's stable and ready for use in production environments.\n• Improved reliability of session auto-reconnect in certain cases where a script was running for ~50 minutes and threw a \"Cmdlet not found\" error due to a bug in auto-reconnect logic.\n• Fixed data-type issues of two commonly used \"User\" and \"MailboxFolderUser\" attributes for easy migration of scripts.\n• Enhanced support for filters as it now supports four more operators: EndsWith, Contains, Not and NotLike support. Check Filters in the Exchange Online PowerShell module for attributes that aren't supported in filters.\n• Added support for configuring the Briefing Email for your organization at the user level with Set-UserBriefingConfig and Get-UserBriefingConfig cmdlets.\n• Support for session cleanup using Disconnect-ExchangeOnline cmdlet. This cmdlet is the V2 equivalent of . In addition to cleaning up session object and local files, it also removes the access token from cache, which is used for authenticating against V2 cmdlets.\n• You can now use as an identity parameter in Get-EXOMailboxFolderPermission. You can get the value using Get-MailboxFolder. For example:\n• Improved reliability of Get-EXOMailboxStatistics as certain request routing errors that led to failures have been resolved.\n• Optimized memory usage when a session is created by re-using any existing module with a new session instead of creating a new one every time a session is imported.\n• Added support for Security & Compliance PowerShell cmdlets using the Connect-IPPSSession cmdlet.\n• Hiding the announcement banner is available using the ShowBanner switch ( ).\n• Remote PowerShell contained various complex data types that were intentionally not supported in EXO cmdlets to improve performance. Differences in non-complex data types between remote PowerShell cmdlets and V2 cmdlets have been resolved to allow seamless migration of management scripts.\n• Support for prefix during session creation:\n• You can create only one session at a time that contains prefixed cmdlets.\n• EXO V2 cmdlets aren't prefixed because they already have the prefix EXO, so don't use as a prefix.\n• Use EXO V2 cmdlets even if WinRM Basic Auth is disabled on client machine. Remote PowerShell connections require WinRM Basic Auth, and remote PowerShell cmdlets aren't available if Basic Auth is disabled in WinRM.\n• Identity parameter for V2 cmdlets now supports Name and Alias. Using Alias or Name slows down the performance of V2 cmdlets, so we don't recommend using them.\n• Fixed issue where the data type of attributes returned by V2 cmdlet was different from remote PowerShell cmdlets. We still have few attributes with differing data types, and we plan to handle them in coming months.\n• Fixed bug: Frequent sessions reconnect issue when Connect-ExchangeOnline was invoked with Credentials or UserPrincipalName\n• Fixed a bug where piped cmdlets were failing with the following error due to an authentication issue: Cannot invoke the pipeline because the runspace isn't in the Opened state. Current state of the runspace is 'Closed'.\n• Fixed an issue in Get-Help where the Online parameter was redirecting to a nonexistent page with error code 400.\n• Added support for managing Exchange for a different tenant using delegation flow.\n• Works in tandem with other PowerShell modules in a single PowerShell window.\n• Sessions created internal to EXO V2 Module now have names (naming pattern: ExchangeOnlineInternalSession_%SomeNumber%).\n• Bug fix: Remote PowerShell cmdlets intermittently failing due to time the difference between token expiry and the Session going idle."

Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.\n\nUse the Get-Mailbox cmdlet to view mailbox objects and attributes, populate property pages, or supply mailbox information to other tasks.\n\nNote: In Exchange Online PowerShell, we recommend that you use the Get-EXOMailbox cmdlet instead of this cmdlet. For more information, see Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell.\n\nFor information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see Exchange cmdlet syntax.\n\nWhen you use the Get-Mailbox cmdlet in on-premises Exchange environments to view the quota settings for a mailbox, you first need to check the value of the UseDatabaseQuotaDefaults property. The value True means per-mailbox quota settings are ignored, and you need to use the Get-MailboxDatabase cmdlet to see the actual values. If the UseDatabaseQuotaDefaults property is False, the per-mailbox quota settings are used, so what you see with the Get-Mailbox cmdlet are the actual quota values for the mailbox.\n\nYou need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet.\n\nThis example returns a summary list of all the mailboxes in your organization.\n\nThis example returns a list of all the mailboxes in your organization in the Users OU.\n\nThis example returns all the mailboxes that resolve from the ambiguous name resolution search on the string \"Chr\". This example returns mailboxes for users such as Chris Ashton, Christian Hess, and Christa Geller.\n\nThis example returns a summary list of all archive mailboxes in the database named MBXDB01.\n\nThis example returns information about the remote archive mailbox for the user ed@contoso.com.\n\nThe Identity parameter specifies the mailbox that you want to view. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the mailbox. For example:\n\nYou can't use this parameter with the Anr, Database, MailboxPlan or Server parameters.\n\nThe Anr parameter specifies a string on which to perform an ambiguous name resolution (ANR) search. You can specify a partial string and search for objects with an attribute that matches that string. The default attributes searched are:\n\nThis parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.\n\nThe Arbitration switch specifies whether to return only arbitration mailboxes in the results. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.\n\nArbitration mailboxes are system mailboxes that are used for storing different types of system data and for managing messaging approval workflow.\n\nTo return arbitration mailboxes that are used to store audit log settings or data, don't use this switch. Instead, use the AuditLog or AuxAuditLog switches.\n\nThe Archive switch specifies whether to return only mailboxes that have an archive enabled in the results. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.\n\nThis parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.\n\nThe AuditLog switch specifies whether to return only audit log mailboxes in the results. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.\n\nAudit log mailboxes are arbitration mailboxes that are used to store audit log settings.\n\nTo return other types of arbitration mailboxes, don't use this switch.

Instead, use the Arbitration switch.\n\nThis parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.\n\nThe Credential parameter specifies the username and password that's used to run this command. Typically, you use this parameter in scripts or when you need to provide different credentials that have the required permissions.\n\nA value for this parameter requires the Get-Credential cmdlet. To pause this command and receive a prompt for credentials, use the value . Or, before you run this command, store the credentials in a variable (for example, ) and then use the variable name ( ) for this parameter. For more information, see Get-Credential.\n\nThis parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.\n\nThe Database parameter filters the results by mailbox database. When you use this parameter, only mailboxes on the specified database are included in the results. You can any value that uniquely identifies the database. For example:\n\nYou can't use this parameter with the Anr, Identity, or Server parameters.\n\nThis parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.\n\nThe DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.\n\nThe Filter parameter uses OPATH syntax to filter the results by the specified properties and values. The search criteria uses the syntax .\n• Enclose the whole OPATH filter in double quotation marks \" \". If the filter contains system values (for example, , , or ), use single quotation marks ' ' instead. Although this parameter is a string (not a system block), you can also use braces { }, but only if the filter doesn't contain variables.\n• Property is a filterable property. For more information about the filterable properties, see Filterable properties for the Filter parameter.\n• ComparisonOperator is an OPATH comparison operator (for example for equals and for string comparison). For more information about comparison operators, see about_Comparison_Operators.\n• Value is the property value to search for. Enclose text values and variables in single quotation marks ( or ). If a variable value contains single quotation marks, you need to identify (escape) the single quotation marks to expand the variable correctly. For example, instead of , use . Don't enclose integers or system values in quotation marks (for example, use , , , or instead).\n\nYou can chain multiple search criteria together using the logical operators and . For example, or .\n\nFor detailed information about OPATH filters in Exchange, see Additional OPATH syntax information.\n\nThe GroupMailbox switch specifies whether to return only Microsoft 365 Groups in the results. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.\n\nThis parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.\n\nThe IgnoreDefaultScope switch tells the command to ignore the default recipient scope setting for the Exchange PowerShell session, and to use the entire forest as the scope. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.\n\nThis switch enables the command to access Active Directory objects that aren't currently available in the default scope, but also introduces the following restrictions:\n• You can't use the DomainController parameter. The command uses an appropriate global catalog server automatically.\n• You can only use the DN for the Identity parameter. Other forms of identification, such as alias or GUID, aren't accepted.\n\nThis parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.\n\nThe InactiveMailboxOnly switch specifies whether to return only inactive mailboxes in the results. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.\n\nAn inactive mailbox is a mailbox that's placed on Litigation Hold or In-Place Hold before it's soft-deleted. The contents of an inactive mailbox are preserved until the hold is removed.\n\nTo include active and inactive mailboxes in the results, don't use this switch. Instead, use the IncludeInactiveMailbox switch.\n\nThis parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.\n\nThis parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.\n\nThis parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.\n\nThis parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.\n\nThis parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.\n\nThis parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.\n\nThe IncludeInactiveMailbox switch specifies whether to include inactive mailboxes in the results. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.\n\nAn inactive mailbox is a mailbox that's placed on Litigation Hold or In-Place Hold before it's soft-deleted. The contents of an inactive mailbox are preserved until the hold is removed.\n\nTo return only inactive mailboxes in the results, don't use this switch. Instead, use the InactiveMailboxOnly switch.\n\nThis parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.\n\nThe MailboxPlan parameter filters the results by mailbox plan. When you use this parameter, only mailboxes that are assigned the specified mailbox plan are returned in the results. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the mailbox plan. For example:\n\nA mailbox plan specifies the permissions and features available to a mailbox user in cloud-based organizations. You can see the available mailbox plans by using the Get-MailboxPlan cmdlet.\n\nYou can't use this parameter with the Anr or Identity parameters.\n\nThe Migration switch specifies whether to return only migration mailboxes in the results. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.\n\nThis parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.\n\nThe Monitoring switch specifies whether to return only monitoring mailboxes in the results. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.\n\nMonitoring mailboxes are associated with managed availability and the Exchange Health Manager service, and have a RecipientTypeDetails property value of MonitoringMailbox.\n\nThe OrganizationalUnit parameter filters the results based on the object's location in Active Directory. Only objects that exist in the specified location are returned. Valid input for this parameter is an organizational unit (OU) or domain that's returned by the Get-OrganizationalUnit cmdlet. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the OU or domain. For example:\n\nThe PublicFolder switch specifies whether to return only public folder mailboxes in the results. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.\n\nPublic folder mailboxes are specially designed mailboxes that store the hierarchy and content of public folders.\n\nThis parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.\n\nThe ReadFromDomainController switch specifies that information should be read from a domain controller in the user's domain. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.\n\nThe command: to include all objects in the forest requires the ReadFromDomainController switch. Otherwise, the command might use a global catalog that contains outdated information. Also, you might need to run multiple iterations of the command with the ReadFromDomainController switch to get the information.\n\nBy default, the recipient scope is set to the domain that hosts your Exchange servers.\n\nThe RecipientTypeDetails parameter filters the results by the specified mailbox subtype. Valid values are:\n• GroupMailbox (Exchange 2013 or later and cloud)\n• LinkedRoomMailbox (Exchange 2013 or later and cloud)\n• SchedulingMailbox (Exchange 2016 or later and cloud)\n• TeamMailbox (Exchange 2013 or later and cloud)\n\nYou can specify multiple values separated by commas.\n\nThis parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.\n\nThe RemoteArchive switch specifies whether to return only remote archive mailboxes in the results. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.\n\nRemote archive mailboxes are archive mailboxes in the cloud-based service that are associated with mailbox users in on-premises Exchange organizations.\n\nThe ResultSize parameter specifies the maximum number of results to return. If you want to return all requests that match the query, use unlimited for the value of this parameter. The default value is 1000.\n\nThis parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.\n\nThe Server parameter filters the results by Exchange server. When you use this parameter, only mailboxes on the specified Exchange server are included in the results.\n\nYou can use any value that uniquely identifies the server. For example:\n\nYou can't use this parameter with the Anr, Database, or Identity parameters.\n\nThe ServerName and ServerLegacyDN properties for a mailbox may not be updated immediately after a mailbox move within a database availability group (DAG). To get the most up-to-date values for these mailbox properties, run the command .\n\nNote: The result from this parameter could be a legacy value before migration. For better results, use the Database parameter instead.\n\nThis parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.\n\nThe SoftDeletedMailbox switch specifies whether to return only soft-deleted mailboxes in the results. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.\n\nSoft-deleted mailboxes are deleted mailboxes that are still recoverable.\n\nThe SortBy parameter specifies the property to sort the results by. You can sort by only one property at a time. The results are sorted in ascending order.\n\nIf the default view doesn't include the property you're sorting by, you can append the command with . to create a new view that contains all of the properties that you want to see. Wildcards (*) in the property names are supported.\n\nYou can sort by the following properties:\n\nThis parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.\n\nThis parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.\n\nThis cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see about_CommonParameters.\n\nTo see the input types that this cmdlet accepts, see Cmdlet Input and Output Types. If the Input Type field for a cmdlet is blank, the cmdlet doesn't accept input data.\n\nTo see the return types, which are also known as output types, that this cmdlet accepts, see Cmdlet Input and Output Types.

        "document": "This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange. Use the New-MailboxExportRequest cmdlet to begin the process of exporting contents of a primary mailbox or archive to a .pst file. This cmdlet is available only in the Mailbox Import Export role, and by default, the role isn't assigned to any role groups. To use this cmdlet, you need to add the Mailbox Import Export role to a role group (for example, to the Organization Management role group). For more information, see Add a role to a role group. For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see Exchange cmdlet syntax.\n\nYou can create more than one mailbox export request per mailbox, and each mailbox export request must have a unique name. Microsoft Exchange automatically generates up to 10 unique names for a mailbox export request. However, to create more than 10 export requests for a mailbox, you need to specify a unique name when creating the export request. You can remove existing export requests with the Remove-MailboxExportRequest cmdlet before starting a new request with the default request name (where X = 0-9). You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet. You need to grant the following permission to the group Exchange Trusted Subsystem to the network share where you want to export or import PST files:\n• To import PST files from the share: Read permission\n• To save exported PST files to the share: Read/Write permission. If you don't grant this permission, you will receive an error message stating that Exchange is unable to establish a connection to the PST file on the network share.\n\nThe AcceptLargeDataLoss switch specifies the request should continue even if a large number of items in the source mailbox can't be copied to the target mailbox. You don't need to specify a value with this switch. In Exchange 2013 or later, you need to use this switch if you set the LargeItemLimit parameter to a value of 51 or higher. Otherwise, the command will fail. In Exchange 2010, you need to use this switch if you set the BadItemLimit parameter to a value of 51 or higher. Otherwise, the command will fail.\n\nThe BadItemLimit parameter specifies the maximum number of bad items that are allowed before the request fails. A bad item is a corrupt item in the source mailbox that can't be copied to the target mailbox. Also included in the bad item limit are missing items. Missing items are items in the source mailbox that can't be found in the target mailbox when the request is ready to complete. Valid input for this parameter is an integer or the value unlimited. The default value is 0, which means the request will fail if any bad items are detected. If you are OK with leaving a few bad items behind, you can set this parameter to a reasonable value (we recommend 10 or lower) so the request can proceed. If too many bad items are detected, consider using the New-MailboxRepairRequest cmdlet to attempt to fix corrupted items in the source mailbox, and try the request again. In Exchange 2010, if you set this value to 51 or higher, you also need to use the AcceptLargeDataLoss switch. Otherwise, the command will fail.\n\nImportant: You can't use this parameter to export between two dates. If you try, you'll get system convert errors. You can export from a specific date, or export to a specific date, but not both. The ContentFilter parameter uses OPATH filter syntax to filter the results by the specified properties and values. Only contents that match the ContentFilter parameter will be exported into the .pst file. The search criteria uses the syntax .\n• Enclose the whole OPATH filter in double quotation marks \" \". If the filter contains system values (for example, , , or ), use single quotation marks ' ' instead. Although this parameter is a string (not a system block), you can also use braces { }, but only if the filter doesn't contain variables.\n• Property is a filterable property. For filterable properties, see Filterable properties for the ContentFilter parameter.\n• ComparisonOperator is an OPATH comparison operator (for example for equals and for string comparison). For more information about comparison operators, see about_Comparison_Operators.\n• Value is the property value to search for. Enclose text values and variables in single quotation marks ( or ). If a variable value contains single quotation marks, you need to identify (escape) the single quotation marks to expand the variable correctly. For example, instead of , use . Don't enclose integers or system values in quotation marks (for example, use , , , or instead). You can chain multiple search criteria together using the logical operators and . For example, or . For detailed information about OPATH filters in Exchange, see Additional OPATH syntax information.\n\nThe ExcludeFolders parameter specifies the list of folders to exclude during the export. Folder names aren't case-sensitive, and there are no character restrictions. Use the following syntax: : Use this syntax to denote a personal folder under the folder specified in the SourceRootFolder parameter, for example, \"MyProjects\" or \"MyProjects/FY2010\". : Use this syntax to denote a well-known folder regardless of the folder's name in another language. For example, #Inbox# denotes the Inbox folder even if the Inbox is localized in Turkish, which is Gelen Kutusu. Well-known folders include the following types: If the user creates a personal folder with the same name as a well-known folder and the # symbol surrounding it, you can use a backslash (\\) as an escape character to specify that folder. For example, if a user creates a folder named #Notes# and you want to specify that folder instead of the well-known Notes folder, use the following syntax: . Wildcard characters can't be used in folder names. To exclude the Recoverable Items folder, you must use the ExcludeDumpster parameter.\n\nThe IncludeFolders parameter specifies the list of folders to include during the export. Folder names aren't case-sensitive, and there are no character restrictions. Use the following syntax: : Use this syntax to denote a personal folder under the folder specified in the SourceRootFolder parameter, for example, \"MyProjects\" or \"MyProjects/FY2010\". : Use this syntax to denote a well-known folder regardless of the folder's name in another language. For example, #Inbox# denotes the Inbox folder even if the Inbox is localized in Turkish, which is Gelen Kutusu. Well-known folders include the following types: If the user creates a personal folder with the same name as a well-known folder and the # symbol surrounding it, you can use a backslash (\\) as an escape character to specify that folder. For example, if a user creates a folder named #Notes# and you want to specify that folder instead of the well-known Notes folder, use the following syntax: . Wildcard characters can't be used in folder names. The Recoverable Items folder is always included if you don't use the ExcludeDumpster parameter, regardless of the list of folders you provide.\n\nThe LargeItemLimit parameter specifies the maximum number of large items that are allowed before the request fails. A large item is a message in the source mailbox that exceeds the maximum message size that's allowed in the target mailbox. If the target mailbox doesn't have a specifically configured maximum message size value, the organization-wide value is used. For more information about maximum message size values, see the following topics: Valid input for this parameter is an integer or the value unlimited. The default value is 0, which means the request will fail if any large items are detected. If you are OK with leaving a few large items behind, you can set this parameter to a reasonable value (we recommend 10 or lower) so the request can proceed. If you set this value to 51 or higher, you also need to use the AcceptLargeDataLoss switch. Otherwise, the command will fail."

For more information, see Mailbox imports and exports in Exchange Server.\n\nThis topic shows you how to:\n\nWhat do you need to know before you begin?\n• None You need to export mailboxes to .pst files on a UNC network share (\\ <Server>\\ <Share>\\ or \\ <LocalServerName>\\c$). The Exchange Trusted Subsystem security group requires the Read/Write permission to the network share. If the share doesn't have this permission, you'll get errors when you try to export mailboxes to .pst files.\n• None You can create mailbox export requests in the Exchange admin center (EAC) or in the Exchange Management Shell. All other procedures can only be done in the Exchange Management Shell. For more information about accessing and using the EAC, see Exchange admin center in Exchange Server. To learn how to open the Exchange Management Shell in your on-premises Exchange organization, see Open the Exchange Management Shell.\n• None For information about keyboard shortcuts that may apply to the procedures in this topic, see Keyboard shortcuts in the Exchange admin center.\n\nUse the EAC to create a mailbox export request\n• None In the EAC, go to Recipients > Mailboxes > click More options , and select Export to a PST file.\n• None The Export to a .pst file wizard opens.

The unique identity of the mailbox export request is (X is either not present, or has the value 0 to 9).\n• None Content and folders: Content in all folder paths in the source mailbox is replicated in the target .pst file.\n• None Priority: , because we aren't using the Priority parameter.\n\nThis example creates a new mailbox export request with these settings:\n• None Mailbox export request name: The custom name Kathleen Reiter Export is specified by the Name parameter. Specifying a custom name allows more than 10 mailbox export requests for the mailbox. The unique identity value of the mailbox export request is (for example, ).\n• None Source mailbox: The archive mailbox for Kathleen Reiter (Kathleen's primary mailbox alias is kreiter).\n• None Content and folders: Only content in the Inbox folder of the mailbox is exported (regardless of the localized name of the folder).\n\nFor detailed syntax and parameter information, see New-MailboxExportRequest.\n\nHow do you know this worked?\n\nTo verify that you've successfully created a mailbox export request, do any of these steps:\n• None In the EAC, click the notification viewer to view the status of the request.\n• None If you created the mailbox export request in the EAC, and selected the option to send notification email messages, check the notification messages.

        "document": "Exchange Server administrators, sometimes, need to export mailboxes from Exchange Server to PST files. Some common reasons include archiving old/unwanted mailboxes, taking backup of mailbox of an employee leaving the organization, and others. To export mailboxes to PST, Exchange Server (2010 SP1 onwards) provides the New-MailboxExportRequest PowerShell command. This cmdlet is used with various parameters and switches to export some specific emails from the mailbox to PST. In this article, we will see how to use the New-MailboxExportRequest PowerShell command to export Exchange mailboxes to PST files.\n\nTo use the New-MailboxExportRequest cmdlet, the user account that you will be using must be assigned with the Mailbox Import Export role. This role is not assigned to any user (role group) by default. You can use the Exchange Admin Center (EAC) to assign the required roles and permissions. Follow the given steps:\n• Open the Exchange Admin Center (EAC). After login, click on Permissions and then admin roles.\n• Enter the name for the group.\n• Click the Add (+) button, under the Roles.\n• Find Mailbox Import Export and double-click on it to add it to the list. Click OK.\n• Add the user account to be used to export data in the Members area and click Save.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the following PowerShell cmdlet in the Exchange Management Shell (EMS) to assign the Mailbox Import Export role.\n\nYou can also assign the newly created role to the user or group by using the below command.\n\nNow, you have to create a share folder where you want to export the PST files and give the right permissions (read and write) on it. After creating the folder, you need to share this folder with the users that have the Import/Export role. You also need to add the Exchange Trusted Sub System to the permissions. These users must have full permissions on the folder.\n\nUsing the New-MailboxExportRequest Cmdlet in Exchange Server\n\nLet us see how to use the New-MailboxExportRequest cmdlet.\n\nTo export a single mailbox to PST, you can use the cmdlet as given below:\n\nIn the above command, “Anubhuti” is the mailbox name and \\\\SERVER01\\PSTFiles\\Anubhuti.pst is the file path where the PST will be exported. Depending on the size of mailbox, it may take some time to finish.\n\nYou can also export multiple mailboxes at once. For this, you can run the cmdlet with a ForEach loop (see the below example):\n\nThis command will export all the mailboxes in your organization to PST files.\n\nYou can see the progress of the export by using the Get-MailboxExportRequest cmdlet. It will show the status of export as Completed, Failed, or In-Progress.\n\nMoreover, you can use various parameters or switches with the New-MailboxExportRequest cmdlet to filter or export specific folders/items from the mailboxes. Here are some parameters or switches that you can use with this cmdlet.\n\nTo export specific folder(s) from the mailbox, you can use the IncludeFolders switch with the cmdlet (see the below example).\n\nTo exclude some particular folders while exporting the mailbox, you can use the ExcludeFolders switch (see the below command).\n\nBy using the ContentFilter parameter, you can export mailbox items to PST based on a specific date or a date range.\n\nTo export items till a particular date, you can use the command as given below:\n\nThe above command will export all the mailbox items till 1st January 2018.\n\nTo export items from a date onwards, you can use the gt switch with the cmdlet (see the below example).\n\nTo export mailbox data for a date range, you can combine the gt and lt switches (see the below example).\n\nAbove, we have explained how to use the New-MailboxExportRequest cmdlet to export mailboxes to PST in Exchange Server. However, it has some limitations, such as mailbox database must be online/mounted, export must be done one-by-one, running script to export all the mailboxes hinders the server performance, and no option to see the export progress.\n\nTo overcome such limitations, you can use Stellar Converter for EDB - an ideal tool to export mailboxes from Exchange database (EDB) file to PST format. It can open any type of EDB file (online/offline) and from any version of Exchange Server - from Exchange 2007 till Exchange 2019. It can export user mailboxes, archives, public folders, and other EDB file items. It can also directly export the mailboxes and other data to a live Exchange Server or Microsoft 365 tenant. The tool also shows real-time progress of the export."

        "document": "There are many reasons why you (as an administrator) need to export Exchange mailboxes or other resources to PST. Let’s go through the list of possible reasons.\n• You need to decommission the server after migration to another server or Office 365. The mailboxes need to be exported and archived for historical purposes.\n• A user has left the company and the mailbox needs to be removed. The data needs to be extracted and archived for future references.\n• The user needs to archive all the data to PST file so as to reduce the mailbox size.\n• Before migration to Office 365 or a newer Exchange Server, some mailboxes will not be needed anymore and an archive must be kept.\n• The management like to reduce the number of mailboxes or spring clean old mailboxes which are not used anymore and archiving of such mailboxes is needed. In this article, we will be going through different methods with stepwise process to export mailboxes from the Exchange Server database to the PST file format. Below, we will discuss the step-by-step process to export Exchange mailboxes to PST using the PowerShell commands, Exchange Admin Center (EAC), and a third-party EDB to PST converter tool. You can use PowerShell commands in Exchange Management Shell (EMS) to export mailboxes to PST. This method comes in handy when you need to export several mailboxes as you can create scripts to export multiple mailboxes at once. However, you must consider the expertise needed to execute the commands and the performance of the server. Before going ahead with the export, you need to fulfil some prerequisites. You need to ensure that the user must have the right roles and permissions assigned. To assign the required roles and permissions, you can use the Exchange Admin Center (EAC) or PowerShell commands. To assign the roles from the Exchange Admin Center (EAC),\n• Log into the portal and click on Permissions and Admin Roles.\n\nIt is to be noted that you cannot store the PST files on a drive. The destination must be a network share. You need to create a folder and share it with the respective user and the Exchange Trusted Subsystem (see the below image).\n\nThis is a simple command to export a mailbox to PST with no criteria. You can also apply some criteria when exporting. For example, to include specific folders to export, you can use the below command.\n\nTo export emails based on dates, you can use the command with the Content Filter option using the lt (less than) and gt (greater than) parameters. To export emails older than a particular date, use the below command:\n\nFor quick and hassle-free export, you can use a third-party EDB to PST converter tool, like Stellar Converter for EDB. This tool can open Hosted Exchange databases and offline databases of any Exchange Server version. It doesn’t require any special permissions to export the mailboxes. You just need to select the database file and follow some simple steps to complete the export process. Once you select and open the Exchange database, you can browse through the datastore in an Outlook-like interface."
