        "document": "If you participate in competitive programming, you might be familiar with the fact that questions related to Prime numbers are one of the choices of the problem setter. Here, we will discuss how to optimize your function which checks for the Prime number in the given set of ranges, and will also calculate the timings to execute them.\n\nGoing by definition, a Prime number is a positive integer that is divisible only by itself and 1. For example: 2,3,5,7. But if a number can be factored into smaller numbers, it is called a Composite number. For example: 4=2*2, 6=2*3\n\nAnd the integer 1 is neither a prime number nor a composite number. Checking that a number is prime is easy but efficiently checking needs some effort.\n\nLet us now go with the very first function to check whether a number, say n, is prime or not. In this method, we will test all divisors from 2 to n-1. We will skip 1 and n. If n is divisible by any of the divisor, the function will return False, else True. Following are the steps used in this method:\n• If the integer is less than equal to 1, it returns False.\n• If the given number is divisible by any of the numbers from 2 to n, the function will return False\n• Else it will return True\n\nIn the above code, we check all the numbers from 1 to 100000 whether those numbers are prime or not. It has a huge runtime as shown. It takes around 1 minute to run. This is a simple approach but takes a lot of time to run. So, it is not preferred in competitive programming.\n\n\n\nIn this method, we use a simple trick by reducing the number of divisors we check for. We have found that there is a fine line which acts as the mirror as shows the factorization below the line and factorization above the line just in reverse order. The line which divided the factors into two halves is the line of the square root of the number. If the number is a perfect square, we can shift the line by 1 and if we can get the integer value of the line which divides.\n\nIn this function, we calculate an integer, say max_div, which is the square root of the number and get its floor value using the math library of Python. In the last example, we iterate from 2 to n-1. But in this, we reduce the divisors by half as shown. You need to import the math module to get the floor and sqrt function. \n\nFollowing are the steps used in this method:\n• If the integer is less than equal to 1, it returns False.\n• Now, we reduce the numbers which needs to be checked to the square root of the given number.\n• If the given number is divisible by any of the numbers from 2 to the square root of the number, the function will return False\n• Else it will return True\n\nIn the above code, we check all the numbers from 1 to 100000 whether those numbers are prime or not. It takes comparatively lesser time than the previous method. This is a bit tricky approach but makes a huge difference in the runtime of the code. So, it is more preferred in competitive programming. \n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we will optimize our code to next level which takes lesser time than the previous method. You might have noticed that in the last example, we iterated through every even number up to the limit which was a waste. The thing to notice is that all the even numbers except two can not be prime number. In this method, we kick out all the even numbers to optimize our code and will check only the odd divisors. \n\nFollowing are the steps used in this method:\n• If the integer is less than equal to 1, it returns False.\n• If the number is divisible by 2, it will return True if the number is equal to 2 else false.\n• Now, we have checked all the even numbers. Now, look for the odd numbers.\n• If the given number is divisible by any of the numbers from 3 to the square root of the number skipping all the even numbers, the function will return False\n• Else it will return True\n\nIn the above code, we check all the numbers from 1 to 100000 whether those numbers are prime or not. It takes comparatively lesser time than all the previous methods for running the program. It is most efficient and quickest way to check for the prime number. Therefore, it is most preferred in competitive programming. Next time while attempting any question in competitive programming, use this method for best results.\n\n\n\nThis method prints all the primes smaller than or equal to a given number, n. For example, if n is 10, the output should be “2, 3, 5, 7”. If n is 20, the output should be “2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19”. \n\nThis method is considered to be the most efficient method to generate all the primes smaller than the given number, n. It is considered as the fastest method of all to generate a list of prime numbers. This method is not suited to check for a particular number. This method is preferred for generating the list of all the prime numbers.\n\nNote : Time required for all the procedures may vary depending on the compiler but the order of time required by the different methods will remain same."

        "document": "P.s. I am very inexperienced and have just been introduced to programming a month ago.\n\nBut my question really is how to do it, but WHY. I understand that 1 is not considered a \"prime\" number even though it is, and I understand that if it divides by ANYTHING within the range it is automatically not a prime thus the return False statement. but my question is what role does the square-rooting the \"n\" play here ?\n\nSo I was able to solve this problem with a little bit of help from the internet and this is what I got:\n\nOf many prime number tests floating around the Internet, consider the following Python function: def is_prime(n): if n == 2 or n == 3: return True if n < 2 or n%2 == 0: return False if n < 9: return True if n%3 == 0: return False r = int(n**0.5) # since all primes > 3 are of the form 6n ± 1 # start with f=5 (which is prime) # and test f, f+2 for being prime # then loop by 6. f = 5 while f <= r: print('\\t',f) if n % f == 0: return False if n % (f+2) == 0: return False f += 6 return True Since all primes > 3 are of the form 6n ± 1, once we eliminate that is:\n• not 2 or 3 (which are prime) and\n• not even (with ) and\n• not divisible by 3 (with ) then we can test every 6th n ± 1. The line evaluates to 70 (the square root of 5003 is 70.7318881411 and truncates this value) Consider the next odd number (since all even numbers other than 2 are not prime) of 5005, same thing prints: The limit is the square root since The function only has to go 1 loop to find that 5005 is divisible by 5 and therefore not prime. Since (and both are 5005), we do not need to go all the way to 1001 in the loop to know what we know at 5! Now, let's look at the algorithm you have: def isPrime(n): for i in range(2, int(n**0.5)+1): if n % i == 0: return False return True\n• It does not test if is less than 2, and there are no primes less than 2;\n• It tests every number between 2 and n**0.5 including all even and all odd numbers. Since every number greater than 2 that is divisible by 2 is not prime, we can speed it up a little by only testing odd numbers greater than 2. def isPrime2(n): if n==2 or n==3: return True if n%2==0 or n<2: return False for i in range(3, int(n**0.5)+1, 2): # only odd numbers if n%i==0: return False return True OK -- that speeds it up by about 30% (I benchmarked it...) The algorithm I used is about 2x times faster still, since only every 6th integer is looping through the loop. (Once again, I benchmarked it.) Side note 2: primality testing is an interesting problem in computer science.\n\nWith , you are not squaring n, but taking the square root. Consider the number 20; the integer factors are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20. When you divide 20 by 2 and get 10, you know that it is also divisible by 10, without having to check. When you divide it by 4 and get 5, you know it is divisible by both 4 and 5, without having to check for 5. After reaching this halfway point in the factors, you will have no more numbers to check which you haven't already recognized as factors earlier. Therefore, you only need to go halfway to see if something is prime, and this halfway point can be found by taking the number's square root. Also, the reason 1 isn't a prime number is because prime numbers are defined as having 2 factors, 1 and itself. i.e 2 is 1*2, 3 is 1*3, 5 is 1*5. But 1 (1*1) only has 1 factor, itself. Therefore, it doesn't meet this definition.\n\nimport math def isPrime(n): 'Returns True if n is prime, False if n is not prime. Will not work if n is 0 or 1' # Make sure n is a positive integer n = abs(int(n)) # Case 1: the number is 2 (prime) if n == 2: return True # Case 2: the number is even (not prime) if n % 2 == 0: return False # Case 3: the number is odd (could be prime or not) # Check odd numbers less than the square root for possible factors r = math.sqrt(n) x = 3 while x <= r: if n % x == 0: return False # A factor was found, so number is not prime x += 2 # Increment to the next odd number # No factors found, so number is prime return True To answer the original question, n**0.5 is the same as the square of root of n. You can stop checking for factors after this number because a composite number will always have a factor less than or equal to its square root. This is faster than say just checking all of the factors between 2 and n for every n, because we check fewer numbers, which saves more time as n grows.\n\nI don't know if I am late but I will leave this here to help someone in future. We use the square root of (n) i.e int(n**0.5) to reduce the range of numbers your program will be forced to calculate. For example, we can do a trial division to test the primality of 100. Let's look at all the divisors of 100: 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50 Here we see that the largest factor is 100/2 = 50. This is true for all n: all divisors are less than or equal to n/2. If we take a closer look at the divisors, we will see that some of them are redundant. If we write the list differently: 100 = 2 × 50 = 4 × 25 = 5 × 20 = 10 × 10 = 20 × 5 = 25 × 4 = 50 × 2 the redundancy becomes obvious. Once we reach 10, which is √100, the divisors just flip around and repeat. Therefore, we can further eliminate testing divisors greater than √n. Take another number like 16. You can note that after reaching 4, which is the square root of 16, we repeated 8 * 2 which we had already done as 2*8. This pattern is true for all numbers. To avoid repeating ourselves, we thus test for primality up to the square root of a number n. So we convert the square root to int because we do not want a range with floating numbers. Read the primality test on wikipedia for more info.\n\nWe know natural numbers starting from 2: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ...} are considered prime if they are only divisible by 1 and themselves. The first and only even prime is 2. The next prime numbers are: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, ..., and infinitely many more primes. Programmatically, there are many algorithms involving prime numbers. The most simple and inefficient way (naive version) is to test by definition, i.e., test if N is divisible by divisor 2 [2..N-1]. This works but runs in O(N) in terms of the number of divisions. This is not the best way, and there are several possible improvements. The first improvement is to test if N is divisible by a divisor 2 [2..sqrt(N)], i.e., we stop when the divisor is greater than sqrt(N). We claim that if a * b = N, then a <= sqrt(N) or b <= sqrt(N). Quick proof by contradiction: Let’s suppose that it is not the case, i.e., a > sqrt(N) and b > sqrt(N). This implies that a * b > sqrt(N) * sqrt(N) or a * b > N. This improvement is O(sqrt(N)), which is already much faster than the previous naive version but can still be improved to be twice as fast. The second improvement is to test if N is divisible by a divisor 2 [3, 5, ..., sqrt(N)], i.e., we only test odd numbers up to sqrt(N). This is because there is only one even prime number, i.e., number 2, which can be tested separately. Here's the code for it, but you can even optimize this code for better performance. def is_prime(number): if number <= 1: return False elif number == 2: return True elif number % 2 == 0: return False else: # Check for divisibility from 3 up to the square root of the number for i in range(3, int(number**0.5) + 1, 2): if number % i == 0: return False return True num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \")) if is_prime(num): print(f\"{num} is a prime number.\") else: print(f\"{num} is not a prime number.\")\n\nRemember kids order of operations is important. Doing it like this eliminates useless branches that costs performance and checks special rare cases only when necessary. there is no need to check if unless is odd. And there is no need to check if unless is not divisible by any positive numbers other than itself and 1 because it's a rare special case. Also checking is slower, atleast in python. That's why I stopped in 3. from math import sqrt def is_prime(n): if not n%2: return n==2 if not n%3: return n==3 for i in range(5,int(sqrt(n))+1,2): if not n%i: return False return n>1 This is even faster solution, which doesn't check numbers that are multipliers of 2 and 3 (in the loop) instead of 2 only. Btw, I stored to prevent the while loop from calculating it every iteration. def is_prime(n): if not n&1: return n==2 if not n%3: return n==3 i,r=5,int(sqrt(n)) while i<=r: if not n%i or not n%(i+2): return False i+=6 return n>1\n\nTo answer the question in the title: use . To answer your question about the \"square-rooting\": to check whether n is prime, it is sufficient to look for factors up to √n, because for any larger factor q, one would have the smaller factor n/q. Concerning the given algorithm, it is extremely inefficient to trial-divide by all numbers from 2 up to √n, because almost all of them (*) are not primes, and it's useless to try those, because if n were a multiple of i = p * q, then it would also be a multiple of the smaller factor p which would have been found much earlier. So one should at least check only the odd numbers i, which is extremely easy: just use with a step size — of course after first checking that n indeed is odd (with ). The \"better\" option to check only prime divisors would be more complicated and maybe not even more efficient, if you don't have/want to create a sufficiently large list of \"precomputed\" primes.) (*) \"almost all\" has precise mathematical meanings (google it), but here it is sufficient to read it as \"the vast majority\" - in particular, all even numbers > 2."

The first few prime numbers are:\n\nA prime number is a number greater than 1 that cannot be expressed as the product of two smaller positive integers. Simply defined as prime numbers are divisible only by 1 and themselves. The sequence of prime numbers starts with 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and so on.\n\nIn this article, we will explore how to check prime numbers in Python, including using the isprime function and writing a prime-checking algorithm.\n\nPrime numbers play a significant role in mathematics, cryptography, and various algorithms. If you are building encryption systems or solving computational problems, checking for prime numbers is a common task. Python Program to Check Prime Number can help you automate this process efficiently. As, It has powerful and flexible features which provides multiple ways to check whether a number is prime or not.\n• 2 is prime as its only divisors are 1 and 2.\n• 3 is prime because it can only be divided by 1 and 3.\n• 5 is prime because it is divisible only by 1 and 5.\n• 11 is prime because it is divisible by 1 and 11.\n\nImportance of Prime Numbers in ProgrammingPrime numbers play a critical role in various fields such as cryptography, hashing algorithms, and primality testing. They are also used in mathematical algorithms to improve the efficiency of computations and enhance data security systems.\n\nOverview of Methods to Check Prime Numbers in Python\n\nPython offers several ways to check if a number is prime. The choice of method depends on the size of the number, the level of optimization required, and the available resources.\n\nBasic methods involve straightforward approaches using loops and conditions. These methods are easy to understand and implement but are not efficient for large numbers.\n\nOptimized techniques aim to reduce the number of iterations needed to check primality. These methods often involve advanced mathematical concepts such as square root reduction and skipping even numbers.\n\nAdvanced approaches include methods like recursion, the math module, and primality tests like the Miller-Rabin test. These approaches are highly efficient, especially for large numbers.\n\nOne simple method to check whether a number is prime is by using a flag variable. This approach involves iterating through all numbers up to the given number and checking for divisibility.\n\nThe program uses a flag variable to assume a number is prime initially. It checks divisibility from 2 to the square root of the number. If a divisor is found, the flag is set to False, indicating the number is not prime. If no divisors are found, the flag remains True, and the number is prime.\n\nA more Pythonic way to check for prime numbers is by using the for-else construct. If a number is divisible by any number between 2 and n-1, it will break the loop and return False. If it doesn't find any divisors, the program returns True.\n\nThe program uses a for loop to check if a number is divisible by any number between 2 and n-1. If a divisor is found, the number is not prime, and the function returns 0. If no divisors are found, it returns 1, indicating the number is prime.\n\nOptimization by Reducing Iterations to number/2 or √n\n\nOne of the most effective optimizations is reducing the range of iterations to sqrt(n). Since any factor of n greater than its square root must have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root, we can limit our checks.\n• To check if a number √n is prime, we attempt to divide it by each integer starting from 2 up to √n. If √n is divisible by any of these integers, it is not a prime.\n• If √n is divisible by some number larger than √n​, the corresponding smaller factor would have already been found. Hence, checking divisibility only up to √n is enough to verify primality.\n• This optimization reduces the number of divisions performed, making the algorithm much faster, especially for large numbers.\n\nIn addition to reducing the range of iterations by checking up to √n, another optimization to improve primality testing is skipping even numbers after checking for divisibility by 2. Since any even number greater than 2 is not prime (as it is divisible by 2), we can avoid unnecessary checks for even numbers, thus further improving efficiency.\n• Before entering the loop, we first check if the number nn is divisible by 2. If it is, and n>2n>2, we immediately return False, since any even number greater than 2 is not prime.\n• After checking divisibility by 2, we can skip all even numbers in the iteration process, starting from 3. We can increment the loop variable by 2, ensuring that only odd numbers are tested for divisibility.\n• By skipping even numbers, we reduce the number of iterations in half, making the primality test faster, especially for large numbers.\n\nFor more advanced or alternative approaches to primality testing, recursion provides a useful technique. Recursive methods can sometimes simplify the logic of primality tests by breaking the problem down into smaller, manageable parts.\n\nRecursion can be employed to check whether a number is prime by repeatedly dividing the number and checking its divisibility with smaller integers. Instead of using loops, the function calls itself to test divisibility, making the code more elegant in certain cases.\n\nThe is_prime function checks if a number n is prime by first handling numbers less than or equal to 1. It then checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of n. If no divisors are found, it returns True, indicating n is prime; otherwise, it returns False.\n\nThe math module in Python provides mathematical functions that can simplify prime number checking. One key function is math.sqrt(), which calculates the square root of a number, making it particularly useful for optimizing primality tests.\n\nThe math.sqrt(n) function returns the square root of a given number √n. In the context of checking for prime numbers, we use this function to limit our divisibility checks up to √n, since any divisor greater than nn​ would have a corresponding smaller divisor already detected below √n. This optimization significantly reduces the number of iterations required in primality testing.\n\nThe code defines a function is_prime that checks if a number n is prime. It first returns False for numbers less than or equal to 1, as they are not prime. Then, it checks divisibility by numbers from 2 up to the square root of n. If a divisor is found, it returns False, indicating that n is not prime. If no divisors are found, the function returns True, meaning n is prime. In the example, the function checks if 29 is prime and prints the result \"29 is prime.\"\n\nUsing the sympy.isprime function in python\n\nThe isprime function in python is used to check whether the number is prime or not. A sympy library is used which provides a straightforward function known as sympy.isprime(). This is a powerful tool, especially for large numbers, as it is optimized and handles a variety of edge cases and special number types.\n\nSymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It includes methods for arithmetic, algebra, calculus, and number theory, among other things. The isprime() function is part of the library and is an efficient way to determine if a number is prime. The function is highly optimized for large integers, which makes it an excellent choice for those needing high-performance primality testing.\n\nTo use sympy, you'll need to install it via pip:\n• The sympy library is imported to access the isprime() function.\n• This function calls sympy.isprime(n) to check if the number is prime and returns the corresponding message.\n• The user is asked to enter a number, and the check_prime() function is used to determine if the number is prime.\n\nThe Miller-Rabin test is a probabilistic algorithm used for primality testing. While it can sometimes give a false positive (i.e., an incorrect determination of primality), it is highly efficient and accurate for large numbers when run multiple times.\n\nThe Miller-Rabin primality test works by testing whether a number n behaves like a prime in a mathematical sense, based on certain conditions derived from modular arithmetic. It performs checks using different random bases to reduce the likelihood of false positives. The more times it is repeated with different bases, the more confident we can be in the result.\n\nGenerating prime numbers efficiently is another common task in number theory and cryptography. Python provides various methods to generate primes, either in a specific range or up to the first n primes.\n\nTo generate prime numbers in a range, we can use a simple loop or even a generator function.\n\nA generator function can be used to yield prime numbers one by one in a range, making it more memory efficient for large ranges.\n\nA typical approach is to find all prime numbers within a given range using loops or generators.\n\nPrime numbers have several important applications in various fields of mathematics, cryptography, computer science, and number theory. Here are some of their major uses:\n• Cryptography: Prime numbers play a crucial role in public-key encryption algorithms like RSA. The difficulty of factoring large numbers into primes is the basis of modern encryption systems.\n• Random Number Generation: Some random number generators use prime numbers to create sequences that are difficult to predict.\n• Hash Functions: Primes are used in creating efficient hash functions for data storage and retrieval, improving the performance of search algorithms.\n• Computer Security: In addition to encryption, prime numbers are used for key generation, digital signatures, and other security protocols.‍\n• Mathematical Research: Prime numbers are at the core of many mathematical theorems and conjectures, and they are often studied for their intrinsic properties and patterns.\n\nWhen testing whether a number is prime, there are various methods with varying performance characteristics. These methods differ in their time complexity, efficiency, and use cases.\n\nEach method of primality testing can be analyzed in terms of its time complexity, which is critical for understanding how it scales with large numbers.\n\nPros and Cons of Each Approach\n\nIn conclusion, Prime numbers are essential in many fields of mathematics and computer science. Understanding how to efficiently check for prime numbers in Python is crucial for optimizing algorithms, especially in areas like cryptography. By using methods like square root optimization, recursion, and libraries like sympy, you can ensure that your program efficiently handles primality testing.\n\n1.

Below are the three variants of .\n\nWhen you pass only one argument to the , it will generate a sequence of integers starting from 0 to .\n• Here, and as a default value.\n• If you set the as a 0 or some negative value, then the range will return an empty sequence.\n• If you want to start the range at 1 use .\n\nWhen you pass two arguments to the , it will generate integers starting from the number to .\n• Here, the as a default value.\n• The range will return an empty sequence if you set the value lesser than the .\n\nWhen you pass all three arguments to the range(), it will return a sequence of numbers, starting from the start number, increments by step number, and stops before a stop number.\n\nHere you can specify a different increment by adding a parameter.\n• Here, the as a default value.\n• Python will raise a exception if you set the to 0.\n• The function only works with the integers, So all arguments must be integers. You can not use float numbers or any other data type as a start, stop, and step value. Please refer to generate a range of float numbers in Python\n• All three arguments can be positive or negative.\n• The value must not be zero. If a , Python will raise a exception.\n\nPython for loop executes a block of code or statement repeatedly for a fixed number of times. We can iterate over a sequence of numbers produced by the range() function using for loop.\n\nLet’s see how to use loop with function to print the odd numbers between 1 and 10. Using this example, we can understand how the iterator variable is getting value when we use range() with for loop.\n\nTo understand what means in Python, we need first to understand the working of the function.\n\nThe function uses the generator to produce numbers. It doesn’t generate all numbers at once.\n\nAs you know range() returns the object. A range object uses the same (small) amount of memory, no matter the size of the range it represents. It only stores the start, stop and step values and calculates individual items and subranges as needed.\n\nI.e., It generates the next value only when for loop iteration asked for it. In each loop iteration, It generates the next value and assigns it to the iterator variable i.\n• As you can see in the output, the variable is not getting the values 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 simultaneously.\n• In the first iteration of the loop value of is the start number of a range.\n• Next, In every subsequent iteration of for loop, the value of is incremented by the step value. The value of is determined by the formula .\n\nSo it means range() produces numbers one by one as the loop moves to the next iteration. It saves lots of memory, which makes range() faster and more efficient.\n\nYou can iterate Python sequence types such as list and string using a and for loop.\n\nWhen you iterate the list only using a loop, you can access only items. When you iterate the list only using a loop, you can only access its items, but when you use range() along with the loop, you can access the index number of each item.\n\nThe advantage of using to iterate a list is that it allows us to access each item’s index number. Using index numbers, we can access as well as modify list items if required.\n\nPass the count of total list items to using a function. The will use it as a argument.\n\nYou can display the sequence of numbers produced by a function by descending order or reverse order.\n\nYou can use the following two ways to get the reverse range of numbers in Python.\n\nUse a negative step value in a function to generate the sequence of numbers in reverse order. For example, will produce numbers like 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1.\n\nI.e., you can reverse a loop by setting the step argument of a to -1. It will cause the loop to iterate in reverse order.\n\nLet’s see how to loop in a reverse iteration or backward iteration to display a range of numbers from 5 to 0.\n\nUsing Python’s built-in function, you can reverse any sequence such as list or range.\n• Pass the as an input to the reversed() function, It returns a that accesses the sequence of numbers provided by in the reverse order.\n• Next, iterate the result provided by function using for loop.\n\nExample 2: reverse range starting from 20 to 10\n\nExample 3: reverse range starting from 20 to 10 with step 2\n\nNote: The returns a that accesses the sequence of numbers provided by in the reverse order.\n\nAlso, If you need the list out of it, you need to convert the output of the function to list. So you can get the reverse list of ranges.\n\nUse to reverse a list by passing the count of list items as a argument and as a -1.\n\nLet’s see the various ways to reverse a list of numbers using a\n\nA step is an optional argument of a range(). It is an integer number that determines the increment between each number in the sequence. i.e., It specifies the incrementation.\n\nYou can also define it as a difference between each preceding and next number in the result sequence. For example, If the step is 2, then the difference between each preceding and following number is 2\n\nThe default value of the step is 1 if not specified explicitly.\n\nYou can also perform lots of operations by using step arguments such as reverse a sequence such as a list and string.\n\nYou can decrement range() by using negative value.\n\nWhen we set the negative value to step, In each iteration, the number will go down until it reaches to stop number.\n\nNote: To decrement the must be greater than . A range() return empty sequence if .\n\nAlso, you can use to generate sequence of numbers multiply of n.\n\nAlso, you will get a if you set .\n\nAlso, you can’t use the decimal value. If you want to use the float/decimal step in the , please refer to generating a range of float numbers.\n\nYou can use negative integers in range().\n\nMost of the time, we use the negative step value to reverse a range. But apart from the step, we can use negative values in the other two arguments (start and stop) of a range() function.\n\nExample: Negative range from -1 to -10\n\nLet’s see the example to print the range of numbers from negative to positive.\n\nLet’s understand the above program, we set –\n• In the 1st iteration of the loop, is -1\n• In the 2nd iteration of for loop, is -2 because , and it will repeat this process till the stop number.\n\nExample: Negative reverse range from -10 to -1\n\nYou can also print the negative reverse using a positive integer.\n\nPython function doesn’t return a type. It returns an immutable sequence of integers.\n\nWe can convert to list using a constructor.\n• Pass the function as an input to the list constructor.\n• The constructor automatically creates a list by enclosing the integers returned by the inside the square brackets.\n\nAlso, you can use to access and modify items.\n• Using a function, you can get a count of list items.\n• Next, use this count as a stop number in and iterate for loop times.\n• In each iteration, you will get the index number of a current list item.\n\nIn this section, we will learn how to generate an inclusive range in Python. By default, The is exclusive, so it doesn’t include the last number in the result. It creates the sequence of numbers from to .\n\nFor example, will produce . The result contains numbers from 0 to up to 5 but not five.\n\nIf you notice, the result contains 5 elements which equal to . Note, the index always starts from 0, not 1.\n\nIf you want to include the end number in the result, i.e., If you want to create an inclusive range, then set the stop argument value as .\n\nThe vs comparison is relevant only if you are using Python 2 and Python 3. If you are not using Python 2 you can skip this comparison.\n\nThe range() function works differently between Python 3 and Python 2. If your application runs on both Python 2 and Python 3, you must use instead of for better code compatibility.\n\nIn Python 2, we have and functions to produce a sequence of numbers.\n\nIn Python 3 is renamed to and original function was removed.\n\nSo in simple terms, is removed from Python 3, and we can use only the function to produce the numbers within a given range.\n\nUse of and\n• In Python 2, returns the object, i.e., It does generate all numbers at once. The will generate a Python list of 499 integers in memory. So It consumes high memory and increases the execution time.\n• : The function doesn’t generate all numbers at once. It produces numbers one by one as the loop moves to the next number. So it consumes less memory and resources.\n\nConcatenating the result of two range()\n\nLet say you want to add . And you want the concatenated range like .\n\nFor example, you want to add the result of two functions to produce another sequence of numbers. You can add/merge the result of multiple functions using .\n\nBuilt-in function is the constructor that returns a object, this range object can also be accessed by its index number using indexing and slicing.\n\nIt is essential to know the attributes when you receive it as input to your function, and you wanted to see the value of the , and argument.\n\nsupports both positive and negative indices.

        "document": "The Python range() function returns a sequence of numbers, in a given range. The most common use of it is to iterate sequences on a sequence of numbers using Python loops.\n\nIn the given example, we are printing the number from 0 to 4.\n\nWhat is the use of the range function in Python\n\nIn simple terms, range() allows the user to generate a series of numbers within a given range. Depending on how many arguments the user is passing to the function, the user can decide where that series of numbers will begin and end, as well as how big the difference will be between one number and the next. Python range() function takes can be initialized in 3 ways.\n\nWhen the user call range() with one argument, the user will get a series of numbers that starts at 0 and includes every whole number up to, but not including, the number that the user has provided as the stop.\n\nIn this example, we are printing the number from 0 to 5. We are using the range function in which we are passing the stopping of the loop.\n\nWhen the user call range() with two arguments, the user gets to decide not only where the series of numbers stops but also where it starts, so the user doesn’t have to start at 0 all the time. Users can use range() to generate a series of numbers from X to Y using range(X, Y).\n\nIn this example, we are printing the number from 5 to 19. We are using the range function in which we are passing the starting and stopping points of the loop.\n\nWhen the user call range() with three arguments, the user can choose not only where the series of numbers will start and stop, but also how big the difference will be between one number and the next. If the user doesn’t provide a step, then range() will automatically behave as if the step is 1. In this example, we are printing even numbers between 0 and 10, so we choose our starting point from 0(start = 0) and stop the series at 10(stop = 10). For printing an even number the difference between one number and the next must be 2 (step = 2) after providing a step we get the following output (0, 2, 4, 8).\n\nIn this example, we are printing the number from 0 to 9 with the jump of 2. We are using the range function in which we are passing the starting and stopping points with the jump of the iterator.\n\nIf a user wants to increment, then the user needs steps to be a positive number.\n\nIf a user wants to decrement, then the user needs steps to be a negative number.\n\nPython range() function doesn’t support float numbers. i.e. user cannot use floating-point or non-integer numbers in any of its arguments. Users can use only integer numbers.\n\nConcatenation of two range() functions using itertools chain() method\n\nThe result from two range() functions can be concatenated by using the chain() method of itertools module. The chain() method is used to print all the values in iterable targets one after another mentioned in its arguments.\n\nAccessing range() with an Index Value\n\nA sequence of numbers is returned by the range() function as its object that can be accessed by its index value. Both positive and negative indexing is supported by its object.\n\nIn this example, we are creating a list and we are printing list elements with the range() in Python.\n\nSome Important points to remember about the Python range() function\n• None The range() function only works with integers, i.e. whole numbers.\n• None All arguments must be integers. Users can not pass a string or float number or any other type in a start stop, step\n• None All three arguments can be positive or negative.\n• step value must not be zero. If a step is zero, python raises a ValueError exception.\n• None Users can access items in a range() by index, just as users do with a list.\n\nWhat Does the\n\nHow to Create a Sequence of Numbers with\n\nWhat Are the Parameters of the\n\nHow to Use a Negative Step in the\n\nHow to Generate a List Using"

        "document": "In Python, the function generates a sequence of numbers, often used in loops for iteration. By default, it creates numbers starting from 0 up to but not including a specified stop value. You can also reverse the sequence with . If you need to count backwards, then you can use a negative step, like , which counts down from to .\n\nThe function is not just about iterating over numbers. It can also be used in various programming scenarios beyond simple loops. By mastering , you can write more efficient and readable Python code. Explore how can simplify your code and when alternatives might be more appropriate.\n\nBy the end of this tutorial, you’ll understand that:\n• A range in Python is an object representing an interval of integers, often used for looping.\n• The function can be used to generate sequences of numbers that can be converted to lists.\n• is a loop that iterates over the numbers from 0 to 4, inclusive.\n• The range parameters , , and define where the sequence begins, ends, and the interval between numbers.\n• Ranges can go backward in Python by using a negative step value and reversed by using .\n\nA range is a Python object that represents an interval of integers. Usually, the numbers are consecutive, but you can also specify that you want to space them out. You can create ranges by calling with one, two, or three arguments, as the following examples show:\n\nIn each example, you use to explicitly list the individual elements of each range. You’ll study these examples in more detail later on.\n\nA range can be an effective tool. However, throughout this tutorial, you’ll also explore alternatives that may work better in some situations. You can click the link below to download the code that you’ll see in this tutorial:\n\nIn Python, is built in. This means that you can always call without doing any preparations first. Calling constructs a range object that you can put to use. Later, you’ll see practical examples of how to use range objects. You can provide with one, two, or three integer arguments. This corresponds to three different use cases: You’ll learn how to use each of these next. When you call with one argument, you create a range that counts from zero and up to, but not including, the number you provided: Here, you’ve created a range from zero to five. To see the individual elements in the range, you can use to convert the range to a list: Inspecting shows that it contains the numbers zero, one, two, three, and four. Five itself is not a part of the range. One nice property of these ranges is that the argument, in this case, is the same as the number of elements in the range. You can call with two arguments. The first value will be the start of the range. As before, the range will count up to, but not include, the second value: The representation of a range object just shows you the arguments that you provided, so it’s not super helpful in this case. You can use to inspect the individual elements: Observe that starts at one and includes the consecutive numbers up to six. Seven is the limit of the range and isn’t included. You can calculate the number of elements in a range by subtracting the start value from the end value. In this example, there are 7 - 1 = 6 elements. Count From Start to Stop While Stepping Over Numbers The final way to construct a is by providing a third argument that specifies the step between elements in the range. By default, the step is one, but you can pass any non-zero integer. For example, you can represent all odd numbers below twenty as follows: Here, you specify that you want a range of numbers from one to twenty that are two apart. Have a look at the numbers that are part of this range: You can confirm that the range contains all odd numbers below twenty. The difference between consecutive elements in the range is two, which is equal to the step value that you provided as the third argument. In these examples, you’ve gotten started using ranges in Python. In the rest of the tutorial, you’ll learn more about how works under the hood, and you’ll see several examples of when you’d want to use objects in your own code.\n\nYou’ve seen the syntax of and how you use one, two, or three arguments to specify different kinds of ranges. In this section, you’ll dig deeper into Python’s function and see how to represent specific ranges. Note: Technically, is not a function. Instead, is a type or class. When you call , you’re calling the constructor of the class to create a new range object. Still, for all practical purposes, you can treat as a function that returns a object. First, note that a range is a lazy sequence. This means that Python doesn’t create the individual elements of a range when you create the range. Instead, it creates each element when you ask for it, for example by iterating over the range. This is different from, say, a list. Lists are eagerly constructed, so that all elements in the list are present in memory immediately when the list is created. That’s why you converted ranges into lists to inspect the individual elements earlier: The object is lazy. In this example, the individual numbers in the range are first referenced when you convert it to a list. Additionally, you don’t exhaust ranges when you iterate over them. You can reuse them as many times as you want. One property of ranges that may seem unintuitive is that the start value of the range is included, but the end value isn’t. Python ranges represent half-open intervals, to use a technical term. Closed intervals, which include both the start and end values, are more common in daily use. For example, a regular dice has values from one to six. However, using half-open intervals in programming has several advantages,which Edsger W. Dijkstra outlines as follows:\n• If the start value isn’t included in the range, then you’d need to use to specify a range running from zero.\n• If the end value is included in the range, then it’s awkward to define an empty range.\n• If the range is defined as a half-open interval, then it’s straightforward to calculate the number of elements in the range. You’ve already seen a few examples of the latter point. Recall that contains six elements which you calculate as 7 - 1 = 6. Next, you’ll explore how to create special kinds of ranges. Probably, most of the ranges that you’ll construct will consist of positive numbers. If you only provide one argument when you create a range, then, as you’ve learned, the range counts from zero and up. However, nothing’s stopping you from using negative numbers in your ranges. For example, you can create the numbers from negative ten to zero: Using negative numbers as arguments works similarly to positive numbers. The first element in the range is the start, while the second one is the end, as usual. You can use negative values for both arguments. Here are the numbers from negative seven to negative three: As always, the end value isn’t included in the range. You can still calculate the number of elements by looking at the difference of the arguments. Just keep track of the negative signs: (-3) - (-7) = 4. You can use any integer as a value for the first two arguments. However, many choices will lead to empty ranges. In particular, if the arguments are equal, then you know that the corresponding range will have zero elements. In other words, it’ll be empty: Here, you construct a range starting at . Since is also the end of the range, it’s not included, so the range is empty. In general, an empty range isn’t particularly useful. You probably won’t create an empty range explicitly. However, if you’re working with ranges with dynamic arguments, then some of those arguments may lead to an empty range. As you’ve learned, there are many ways you can create an empty range. If you need to create one explicitly, then the clearest is probably one counting from zero to zero: You confirm that represents an empty range. If your first argument is larger than the second one, then you’ll typically end up with an empty range as well: Here, you’ve constructed a range that runs from four and up to two. Since four is larger than two, there are no numbers in that range. Sometimes, you want to count down from a larger number. That’s what you’ll explore next. So far, you’ve looked at ranges with positive steps. By default, ranges use a step equal to one, but you can use any integer except zero. The following range contains all even numbers from twenty and down to zero: By using a negative step, the range counts down from start to stop. As always, the stop isn’t included. Just as most positive ranges use the default step of one, a step value of negative one is common when counting backward: This range represents counting down from five to zero, inclusive. If you use a negative step, then the range will be empty if the second argument is larger than or equal to the first. You’ve seen that you can use any integer value for the arguments, although the last one can’t be zero. In the next section, you’ll look into some practical use cases where you can loop through a range, as well as situations in which an alternative may be more appropriate.\n\nLoop Through Ranges or Use an Alternative In Python, you can create loops using two different constructs:\n• A loop, or an indefinite loop, repeats an operation until a condition is fulfilled.\n• A loop, or a definite loop, repeats an operation for each element in an existing sequence. Since a range is a sequence, you typically use loops to iterate over ranges. In many languages, including C++, Java, and JavaScript, loops are mainly based on indices. Python loops are different. In Python, a loop is based on sequence elements instead of indices. If you’re more familiar with a different language, you may need to adjust how you approach loops. In particular, if you want to re-create an index-based loop, then you may be tempted to use a range: You loop over indices and use each index to pick out the corresponding letter from the word . This approach works, but it’s usually not the best way to work with loops in Python. In fact, if you’re treating a range as indices in Python, then you should look for an alternative. There are better ways, which you’ll explore in the upcoming sections. But first, you’ll study a situation in which is the right tool for the job. If you need to repeat an operation a fixed number of times, then using a range is often a good solution. You know that is a sequence that contains elements, so looping over such a range will repeat an operation times. For example, the following code block repeats the calls three times: In this code, you repeat the indented block for each element in the range. Because the elements of the range themselves are unimportant, you use the underscore ( ) as a throwaway variable. There are also times when you work with genuine ranges of numbers, and you want to create loops over those ranges. In the next example, you’ll create a multiplication table that shows the products of all combinations of integers up to ten: You create two loops that together will set up the two-dimensional multiplication table. First, you loop over the numbers from one up to and including ten. These will represent the rows in the table, and you can see those numbers at the beginning of each row. You use the second loop to populate each column of a given row. In this range, you use the arguments to calculate times each integer from one to ten. In particular, the last step argument makes sure that numbers in each row are correctly spaced out. To format the table, you use an f-string and the parameter of , which keeps each number on the same line. In this example, you’re working directly with the range of numbers, and it makes sense to use the range in a loop. Loop Directly Over the Iterator Instead Earlier, you used a range to construct the indices of a string. A small variation of that example gives you the individual characters of the string: In most loops, the index isn’t necessary at all. If you’re interested in the characters of a string, then you can take advantage of the string already being iterable. This means that you can loop directly on the string itself: Looping directly on a sequence, like you do here, is simpler and more readable than using indices. If you have a loop where you’re using indices to find individual elements, then you should loop directly on the elements instead. Use to Create Indices Instead Sometimes, you want to work with both indices and the corresponding elements. In the earlier example, you showed the index of each character in a word: For use cases like these, you can use to create indices instead of . With , you wrap an iterable and get access to both the index and the element for each item: With , you generate an index for each element. You can also customize the counter by passing the argument to . Then, the index will begin counting at instead of zero, which is the default. For example, you can start counting letters at index one: Now the first letter is labeled by instead of . The following example is a bit more involved. You have a grid representing a treasure map. The treasures are marked by . The center of the map is at the coordinates (0, 0), and it’s marked by . You can use to find the coordinates of the treasures as follows: You first loop over each line in the grid, using to access the row coordinates. By setting , you ensure that the middle row is labeled with index . In this example, the first row gets row coordinate . Similarly, you loop over each character of each row. Now, you start counting at , which in this example is . According to your program, one treasure is at which translates to one row above the center, three columns to the right of the center. The other treasures are at and . If you need to access both an element and its corresponding index, then you should use . Use for Parallel Iteration Instead If you need to loop over several sequences at the same time, then you can use indices to find elements corresponding to each other: The capital of Norway is Oslo The capital of Canada is Ottawa The capital of Burkina Faso is Ouagadougou Here, you use indices to look up corresponding elements in and . You’re using to construct the indices. As mentioned earlier, there are better approaches in Python than working directly with indices. If you want to loop over several iterables in parallel, then you should use . With , you can rewrite the previous example as follows: The capital of Norway is Oslo The capital of Canada is Ottawa The capital of Burkina Faso is Ouagadougou Note that generates a tuple that you can unpack to one loop variable for each sequence that you loop over. The code inside the loop becomes simpler and more readable when you don’t need to deal with indices. If you need to loop over two or more iterables at the same time, then you should use .\n\nExplore Other Features and Uses of Ranges By now, you know how to construct ranges in Python and how you can loop over them. You’ve even seen some alternatives to using in specific use cases. In this section, you’ll take a closer look at the object and learn which operations it supports. You’ll learn that a range has many attributes and methods in common with tuples and lists, even though the range is lazy. You can use Python’s square bracket notation to pick out a single element from a range: You first construct a range that contains the odd numbers below twenty. Then you pick out the number at index three. Since Python sequences are zero-indexed, this is the fourth odd number, namely seven. Finally, you pick out the second number from the end, which is seventeen. In addition to picking out single elements from a range, you can use slices to create new ranges. A slice can grab one or several elements from a sequence, and the operation uses similar parameters to . In slice syntax, you use a colon ( ) to separate arguments. Additionally, numbers specify start, stop, and optionally a step for the slice. A slice like starts from index and runs up to, but not including, index . You can add a step at the end, so will also run from index to but only include every second index. If you apply a slice to a range, then you get a new range that will contain some or all of the elements of the original range: Again, you start with the odd numbers below twenty. Taking the slice gives you a new range containing the odd numbers from three to nine, inclusive. If you add a step to your slice, then the step in the resulting range changes correspondingly. Check Whether a Number Is a Member of a Range Membership tests in ranges are fast. Sometimes you can check if a value is a member of a range instead of doing other kinds of validations. For example, you can check if is a leap year in the twenty-first century as follows: The leap years are every four years, so you check if is in the range starting at 2000 and including every fourth year up to 2100. Note: In general, leap year calculations are slightly more complicated. A leap year is a year that’s a multiple of four, except for years evenly divisible by 100, but not by 400. In practice, those exceptions mean that 1900 and 2100 aren’t leap years, but 2000 is a leap year. You can always replace the range membership test with an equivalent logical condition: You use the modulus operator ( ) to check that the year is divisible by four. In some cases, using is more readable than spelling out the corresponding equation. One subtle detail with range membership tests is that all members of ranges are integers. This means that numbers with a decimal part are never range members: Here, you check if is part of the integer range starting at one and counting up to ten. While four is in the range, the decimal number is not. To get the same result with a logical test, you must remember to check that the number is divisible by one as well: You can use the modulo operator with the step value of the range to ensure that the number in question is consistent with the step. In general, if the start value isn’t divisible by the step value, then you should subtract the start value from before applying the modulo operator. Calculate the Number of Elements in a Range You’ve learned that for single-step ranges, you can calculate the number of elements in the range by taking the difference between the first two arguments. If the step is different from one, then the calculation is slightly more complicated. You need to do ceiling division with the step size: In this example, you calculate that there are ten odd numbers below twenty. However, for objects, you shouldn’t do this calculation yourself. Instead, you should use to calculate the number of elements: As above, you confirm that there are ten odd numbers below twenty. You can use with all ranges, including empty ones: Earlier, you saw that an empty range has no elements. Consistently, confirms that its length is zero. If you need to loop over a range in reverse, you can use . This function knows how to reverse many iterables, including ranges: Again, you use the odd numbers below twenty to explore. Calling creates a object that you can use in your loops. Listing the elements shows that the range has been reversed, with the odd numbers now appearing in descending order. Unfortunately, isn’t a full object, and it doesn’t support many of the features that you’ve learned about lately. For example, you can’t slice it or ask for its length: : : object of type 'range_iterator' has no len() In practice, this is rarely a problem. For example, the reversed range has the same number of elements as the original range. If you need a reversed range that retains all of its powers, you can construct it manually by calculating new arguments to pass to . As long as is one or negative one, it’s straightforward to reverse a range: You first create a function that can reverse a given range. One neat feature of ranges is that you can access the arguments used to create the range using the attributes , , and . To reverse a range, you use for the first argument and for the second. Additionally, you reverse the sign of . To account for the end value not being included in the range, you need to adjust the first two arguments by subtracting . To test , you first reverse the range that counts down from five to one, inclusive. This gives you a range that counts up from one to five, inclusive, just as it should. A good test of any function that reverses a sequence is to apply it twice. This should always bring back the original sequence. In this case, you confirm that applying twice returns the original range. This function doesn’t work if the step is different from either one or negative one. In such ranges, it’s harder to calculate the new start value because it depends on the last element of the range. For example, the last element of is seventeen. It’s not immediately clear how that’s related to the original arguments. Note: You can find a more complicated version of in the supporting materials, that can handle any step size. To take different step sizes into account, you can reverse the range with a slice instead: For these examples, you consider the range consisting of every fourth number from one up to, but not including, twenty. Since seventeen is the last number in the range, the reversed range starts from seventeen and counts down. Note that applying twice brings back the original range. Even though the stop values are different, the elements of and are the same. In general, you should just use to reverse a range. If you need any special properties of the reversed object, then you can use or a similar calculation instead. So far, you’ve used integers when setting up ranges. You can also use integer-like numbers like binary numbers or hexadecimal numbers instead: Here, is the binary representation of , while is the hexadecimal representation of . It turns out that you can create ranges from self-defined integer-like numbers as well. To be integer-like, your class needs to define the special method to convert your integer-like number into a regular integer. For example, consider the special numbers called π-digits. These are all made up of the digits of the constant π, which is approximately 3.1415926. The first π-digit is 3, the next is 31, the third is 314, and so on. You’ll create to represent such π-digits: Store this class in a file named . You can then import it and play with it: You first create the third π-digit, 314. Because you implemented , you can convert to a regular integer with and use it directly as an argument to . You can use π-digits for all arguments in : The last length calculation confirms that the resulting range contains millions of numbers, as expected. Even though you have some flexibility in providing arguments to , they all need to be integer-like. If you need more flexibility, like creating floating-point number ranges, then you have a few options. You can create a custom class. An example of this is provided in the downloadable materials. If you use NumPy in your project, then you should use its function instead."

        "document": "The range function is a built-in function in Python that allows you to generate sequences of numbers in a simple and controlled way. Thus, the function is very useful in many cases, from a simple iteration over a list or dictionary to creating checklists and other more complex cases.\n\nIn this article, we’ll explore the functionality of the range function in Python, including its basic and advanced syntax, how to use it in a loop, and compare it to other solutions available in Python. Let’s start by introducing the basic syntax of the range function, as well as ways to change its parameters to generate custom sequences.\n\nNext, we’ll show you how to use the range function in different types of loops, such as a for loop and a while loop, to perform operations on each number in the generated sequence. We will also show some practical examples of using the range function in Python programs.\n\nFinally, let’s compare the range function with other solutions available in Python, such as the xrange function and the range() class. By the end of the article, we will have a deeper understanding of how to use the range function in Python and how to apply it to solve programming problems in different contexts.\n\nThe basic syntax of the range function in Python. Which allows you to create a sequence of values ​​or integers, with optional increment or difference between consecutive values.\n\nExample to generate sequence of integers:\n\nAlternatively, you can also specify the sequence of values ​​directly:\n\nAnd you can also use the operator :\n\nIn addition to the basic syntax, there are several advanced features that make the function more powerful and versatile.\n\nConsequently one of these features is the ability to use the argument to specify a custom increment or difference between consecutive values ​​in the string. Thus allowing to generate a sequence of data with a specific pattern, such as a sequence of prime numbers or a sequence of Fibonacci numbers.\n\nSee an example:\n• is the first value in the sequence you want to generate\n• is the last value in the sequence you want to generate\n• is the increment or difference between consecutive values ​​in the sequence (optional)\n\nYou can use the function to generate a sequence of values ​​and then use those values ​​to create a list or set. See in the example, the function receives the three arguments: , and . O is the start value of the sequence, o is the end value of the sequence, and o is the step size between values ​​in the sequence. The function returns the generated sequence of integers:\n\nThe output will be:\n\nAnother way to use it is as a loop. In this example, the function is used inside a loop to generate a sequence of integers from 1 to 10 and print each value in the sequence:\n\nThe output will be:\n\nAnother advanced feature of the range function is its ability to be used in conjunction with the . The function lets you apply a specific function or operation to each value in the sequence, and the function lets you specify the range of values ​​over which the function should be applied. This allows you to create amazing tools.\n\nIn this example, the function is a function that adds 1 to each number passed to it. The function generates a sequence of integers from 1 to 10. Then the function applies the function to each element of the generated sequence and prints the resulting list. Look: one\n\nThe output will be:\n\nAnother example, the function is a function that multiplies each number passed to it by 2. The function is used to generate a sequence of integers from 1 to 10. Then the function is used to apply the function to each element of the sequence generated and the resulting list is printed. Look:\n\nThe output will be:\n\nOverall, understanding its advanced features and various usages, you can use the function to generate valuable and useful data for your projects and to create more powerful and efficient data analysis and software development tools.\n\nThe Python function range() generates a sequence of continuous numbers. It takes three parameters: the first is the starting number of the sequence, the second is the last number of the sequence and the third is the step of the sequence.\n\nWhen using the function with a step of 1, you will get a continuous sequence of integers, starting with the starting number and ending with the last number. For example, it will generate the sequence of integers from 1 to 5.\n\nThe output will be:\n\nIf you want a partial sequence with a different step, you can specify the step as the third parameter of the function . For example, it will generate the partial sequence of integers from 1 to 8, with a step of 2.\n\nThe output will be:\n\nNote that if you specify the last number as the function’s second parameter , it will generate a continuous sequence of integers, starting with the starting number and ending with the last specified number. For example, it will generate the continuous sequence of integers from 1 to 10.\n\nThe output will be:\n\nHowever, if you need to generate continuous sequences with custom values, you can change the function’s parameters . For example, it will generate a continuous sequence of integers from 0 to 9. If you want to start the sequence at the number 100, you can do this by setting the second parameter to 100:\n\nThe output will be:\n\nThis is one of the ways to generate continuous sequences with the . You can also adjust the sequence step using the third parameter, as mentioned earlier. Remember that if the second parameter is less than the first, the function will generate an empty string.\n\nThe Python function range() can generate partial sequences, that is, sequences that contain a limited number of elements. Therefore, you can specify a second parameter greater than the first, which will cause the function to return an empty string.\n\nFor example, it will generate the partial sequence of integers from 5 to 14.\n\nThe output will be:\n\nOn the other hand, if you want a partial sequence with a different step, you can specify the step as the third parameter of the function . In the example, it will generate the partial sequence of integers.\n\nThe output will be:\n\nUsing the range function in a loop\n\nThe function is a built-in function in Python that allows you to generate sequences of numbers. We can use a for loop to iterate over a sequence of numbers in Python and perform an action for each number in the sequence.\n\nThat way, to use the function in a for loop , just pass the argument to the function and specify the necessary parameters. For example, to iterate over a sequence of numbers from 0 to 4, the code would be:\n\nThe result would be:\n\nAlso, you can use the function in a for loop to iterate over a sequence of numbers, with or without increments. For example:\n\nLikewise, the result would be the same as the previous example.\n\nYou can also specify optional parameters to generate a sequence of different numbers. For example, to iterate over a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10, excluding even numbers, the code would be:\n\nThe result would be:\n\nIn short, the function creates a sequence of integers, starting at the number specified in the first parameter and ending at the number specified in the second parameter. Furthermore, if you need a sequence of non-integer numbers or with a different range, you can use other functions such as , or , respectively.\n\nPractical examples of using the function in Python programs\n\nThe function is a built-in function in Python that allows you to generate sequences of numbers. Python programs can use the language in many practical situations.\n\nCreating a list containing the first 1000000000 (10 billion) perfect numbers.\n\nAs a result, a practical example of using the function would be to create a list containing the first 1000000000 (10 billion) perfect numbers. For this, it is possible to use a loop and the function as follows, in the code below it will create a called list that contains the first 10 billion perfect numbers. We will print each number to the screen with each iteration of the loop. Look:\n\nCreating a list containing numbers from 1 to 100, added alternately.\n\nIn this way, it is possible to use a loop and the function as follows, in the code below it will create a called list that contains the numbers from 1 to 100, added alternately. So we’ll add each number to the list if it’s even, or subtract 1 if it’s odd. Look:\n\nThe result will be a list with the numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, …, 97, 99.\n\nCreating a list containing numbers from 1 to 1000, divided into groups of 10.\n\nSoon we can see that it is possible to use the function in conjunction with a cycle to divide a sequence of numbers into groups. To do this, just specify the number of elements you want to include in each group, adding the parameter to the function .\n\nFor example, we can create a list that contains the numbers from 1 to 1000, divided into groups of 10, the code would be:\n\nSo if you specify the parameter as 1, the function will generate a sequence of continuous numbers, starting at the specified number and ending at the specified number. However, if you specify a negative, the sequence of numbers will be generated in reverse order. If you specify a different than 1, the sequence of numbers will be generated with a different interval than normal.\n\nComparison of range function in python with other available solutions\n\nThe function in python is a built-in function that returns a sequence of contiguous integers. This function is equivalent to the function in Python 2, which returns a sequence of contiguous integers, on the other hand, instead of returning a copy of the numbers, it returns an object that is a reference to a table of numbers.\n\nIn fact, class in python is a class where derived from class , and has the same methods and attributes. However we have the main difference between the two is that the class is used to create an instance of an object , while the function returns a reference to an object .\n\nAlthough the class is a more modern way of accessing the sequence of contiguous integers, the function is still widely used in older code and in some situations where you need to create a .\n\nStill, in terms of performance, function is more efficient than class because it is a built-in function and does not require creating a new object instance. Also, class is more complex than function , and may be less readable for developers.\n\nIn general, the choice between using the function in python, the function or the class depends on the specific needs of the project and the experience of the developer.\n\nApplications of the range function in python\n• Mathematical calculations: People often use the function to generate sequences of numbers in mathematical calculations, such as iterating over a range of numbers.\n• Testing Programs: People widely use Python to generate sequences of values ​​in testing programs.\n• Generating random numbers: The function can be used to generate sequences of random numbers, such as in games or simulations.\n• Object-oriented programming: The function is often used in object-oriented programming to generate sequences of values ​​for testing programs.\n• Image processing: Developers can use Python to generate sequences of numbers and apply them in image processing, such as filtering algorithms, etc.\n\nThe Python function is a very useful and versatile built-in function for generating sequences of contiguous integers. Thus people widely use the Python language in various applications, which include mathematical calculations, program testing, random number generation, object-oriented programming, and image processing. Although the class is a more modern way of accessing the sequence of contiguous integers, the function is still widely used and is a popular choice for many developers. Although the class is more complex than the function , the function is more efficient and more readable for developers. In short, the function is a valuable tool for anyone working with Python and is widely used in many projects. Also learn about Scan in python !"
