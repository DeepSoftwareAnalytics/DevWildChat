But in this world, I’m unsure how much PMs and corporate would be willing to support exporting velo code(their version of JavaScript essentially).\n\nI think there’s something about that freedom of being able to switch easily at any time that they want to stay away from with Editor X (at least for now), but being able to use Adobe products as well as other external tools to improve the site is so important, that unless there is built-in integration for all of them, exports are still the fastest, and best way.\n\nMoreover, designers are doing backend things more than ever before, which should be a plus for editor X, but may really be a negative right now…because people can build mockups quickly here and then do them elsewhere, so why would they subscribe to the locked in platform (no matter how good it may be)? Businesses with websites want to ensure their asset is secure, so that even if they get taken down, they won’t lose however much money they’ve invested into it.\n\nAt the end of the day, if this is something that they truly want to offer in some way, figuring out how everything works with hundreds of apps and third-party code is probably a big headache (maybe even a headache for a rich company). When this will get addressed we don’t know. Then again, the only way we know if something is getting worked on is if they tell us.\n\nHopefully soon. Thanks for reading."

To export minified HTML:\n• Go to Main menu > Code export, or press Shift + E\n• Check the Minify HTML checkbox that appears in the export window\n\nThe downloaded ZIP file contains all your site’s pages, styles, scripts, and images:\n• A CSS folder with all your site’s styles included in 3 .css files:\n• a CSS file (e.g., ) that contains all of your site’s custom styles\n• which contains common base styles for the Webflow layout system, as well as all the components like navbars, sliders, and tabs\n• which makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing.\n• A JS folder which contains all the JavaScript files for your site. Elements and features like forms, navbars, sliders, tabs, and interactions rely on these files. If you delete these files, your page might look correct, but it won’t work as expected.\n• An images folder with all the images uploaded in your site’s Assets panel\n• files for all of your site’s pages (including empty Collection template pages)\n\nThe following features and content are not included in exported code and will not function as expected on exported websites:\n• Localized content (i.e., only your site’s primary locale’s pages, elements, and content are included)\n\nWhy is there a “w-” prefix in front of class names?\n\nWebflow prefixes component-specific classes with “w-” to avoid conflicts with other code frameworks.\n\nCan I choose to export only a part of my site’s code?\n\nAt the moment, you can’t choose what gets exported. Every exportable part of your site will be included in each and every export.\n\nCan I edit the code after I export it?\n\nYou can edit the code after exporting. Keep in mind, however, that manual changes to exported files may break some Webflow components.\n\nCan I remove the extensions from the URL of my exported pages?\n\nIf you want to remove the extensions from your exported pages, you can do so with an file.\n\nDo I need to provide attribution to Webflow if I host my site externally?\n\nAfter exporting, you don’t need to provide attribution to Webflow or maintain a Webflow plan for your exported site to work on your own server.\n\nDoes the exported code include my CMS, Memberships, and Ecommerce content?\n\nCMS, User Accounts, and Ecommerce content (databases) aren’t included in exported code. Collection lists will show the empty state, and Collection pages won’t show any content that’s bound to Collection fields.\n\nDoes the exported code include my localized pages, elements, and content?\n\nLocalized pages, elements, and content aren’t included in exported code. Exported code only includes the primary locale.\n\nWill password protected pages still be protected after I export my code?\n\nNo. Any password protected pages on your site won’t be protected after code export.

        "document": "Webflow is a powerful tool for creating websites, but there comes a time when you might need to export your site's code. Whether it's for backup purposes, to hand over to a client, or to host it elsewhere, exporting your Webflow site's code is an important feature.\n\nIt's worth noting that using this feature requires a paid subscription plan.\n\nIn this article, we will explain how to export your Webflow site's code and why this might be necessary.\n\nFirst of all, it's important to understand that Webflow is not just a \"no-code\" tool. I personally see the tool more as a visual interface to help you write HTML, CSS, or JavaScript code more quickly.\n\nWith that said, there are several reasons why you might want to export your Webflow site's code:\n\n1. Backup: Exporting your site's code allows you to keep a backup copy of your work. In case something goes wrong with Webflow or if you lose access to your account, you'll always have a copy of your site. This code can be used in a new Webflow project or operated independently from the tool.\n\n2. External Hosting: While Webflow offers hosting options that centralize management, you might prefer to use your own host. Exporting your site's code allows you to host it wherever you choose, without any attribution required.\n\n3. Client Transfer: If you create websites for clients, they may request a copy of the code. Exporting the code enables them to have a copy of their site and host it themselves if necessary, or simply \"have it in their possession\" as part of their development.\n\nHow to Export Your Webflow Site's Code?\n\nExporting your Webflow site's code is a straightforward process that involves just a few steps:\n• Go to the Designer.\n• Wait for the preparation to complete.\n\nYour code is now exported! ✅\n\nWhat Does the Export of Your Webflow Site's Code Include?\n\nThe export of your Webflow site includes:\n• A CSS folder containing all the styles of your site in 3 .css files.\n• A JS folder containing the Webflow.js file. This file contains all the JavaScript needed for the interactive elements of your pages to function properly.\n• An images folder with all the images uploaded in the asset manager—library—of your site.\n• .html files for all the pages of your site (including collection template pages, but without content).\n\nWhat Does the Export Not Include?\n\nIt's important to note that some features specific to using Webflow's CMS are not included in the code export. This includes:\n\nHowever, CMS and Ecommerce collections can be exported separately in CSV format if you wish to back up your collection items, user accounts, and products.\n\nIn conclusion, exporting your Webflow site's code is a process that is both simple and useful. It meets various needs, whether for backing up your work, transferring it to a client, or hosting it on another platform. It is an essential feature that offers you great flexibility.\n\nHowever, it's important to recognize that certain Webflow features are not included in the export, so be sure to understand what is and isn’t included before proceeding."

In this section, we'll delve into the paramount importance of maintaining high Webflow code export quality and equip you with essential insights to ensure a seamless transition from your creative canvas to the digital realm.\n\nWhen you export Webflow code, you're essentially translating your visual design into a language that browsers and platforms can understand. The goal is to ensure that your meticulously crafted design maintains its integrity, functionality, and aesthetics beyond the confines of the Webflow environment. This demands a keen eye for detail and an understanding of how design elements are translated into code components such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n\nHigh Webflow code export quality begins with the preservation of design consistency. Elements such as typography, color schemes, and spacing that you've painstakingly refined within Webflow should seamlessly transition to the exported code. This consistency not only upholds your brand identity but also ensures that the user experience remains cohesive across different devices and platforms.\n\nOne of the cornerstones of modern web development is responsive design – the ability of a website to adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes and orientations. Maintaining high Webflow code export quality involves ensuring that your design's responsiveness is flawlessly translated into the exported code.

This meticulous process ensures that your design elements, interactions, and aesthetics are faithfully translated into the exported code, resulting in a website that not only looks impressive but also performs exceptionally well. In this section, we'll guide you through the key steps of optimizing your design for effortless Webflow code export.\n\nBefore exporting your Webflow code, it's crucial to ensure a consistent and organized design structure. Create a visual hierarchy that guides users' attention and aligns with your brand identity. Organize your layout with clear sections, headings, and content blocks. Properly naming elements and maintaining a logical arrangement within Webflow sets the stage for a smooth code export process.\n\nTypography plays a vital role in user experience. Ensure that your font choices, sizes, and styles are visually appealing and easily readable. Additionally, consider responsive typography – the seamless adjustment of text size and spacing across different screen sizes. Utilize Webflow's responsive text settings to guarantee that your typography retains its elegance and legibility on various devices.\n\nOptimizing images and graphics is essential for both design integrity and website performance. Prior to exporting, resize and compress images to an appropriate resolution, ensuring a balance between visual quality and loading speed.

Before exporting, review and fine-tune these interactions to ensure they work seamlessly across different browsers and devices. Test hover effects, animations, and transitions to guarantee a consistent and smooth user experience, enhancing the interactivity of your exported website.\n\nAs you export Webflow code, you'll be generating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that power your website. It's essential to ensure that the generated code is clean and efficient. Minimize unnecessary classes and styles, and avoid redundancy. Carefully review the exported code to remove any extraneous elements that might have been generated during the design process. Cleaner code translates to faster loading times and improved performance.\n\nBefore finalizing the export, take advantage of Webflow's built-in preview and testing capabilities. Review your design on different screen sizes and orientations, ensuring that all elements are displayed correctly. Test interactions, buttons, forms, and other dynamic elements to confirm that they function as intended. Webflow's preview mode enables you to simulate user interactions and catch any potential issues before exporting the code.\n\nCreating clear documentation and annotations within your Webflow project is a proactive step to ensure a smooth code export process. Use Webflow's annotation feature to provide notes and explanations about specific design elements, layout choices, and interactions. These annotations will be invaluable as you or other developers work with the exported code, helping to maintain the design vision.\n\nBy optimizing your Webflow design with these considerations in mind, you're setting the stage for an effortless and successful code export. The meticulous attention to design details, responsiveness, performance, and interaction ensures that your creative vision translates seamlessly into code. As you proceed with the export process, these optimized design elements will form the backbone of a website that not only dazzles visually but also delivers exceptional user experiences.\n\nEmbarking on the journey of exporting Webflow code is a dynamic and transformative process.

Take advantage of breakpoints and responsive settings to ensure that your design maintains its aesthetics and functionality across devices. Preview and test your design on various screen sizes to catch any potential responsiveness issues before exporting.\n\nImage optimization is paramount for both design integrity and website performance. Resize and compress images to an appropriate resolution while maintaining visual quality. Use image formats that balance quality and size, such as JPEG or WebP. Additionally, leverage Webflow's asset manager to organize and manage your design assets effectively.\n\nWebflow's interactions and animations add depth and engagement to your designs. Fine-tune these interactions to ensure they translate smoothly into code.
