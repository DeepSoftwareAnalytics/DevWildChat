        "document": "This calculator returns a variety of information regarding Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and IPv6 subnets including possible network addresses, usable host ranges, subnet mask, and IP class, among others.\n\nA subnet is a division of an IP network (internet protocol suite), where an IP network is a set of communications protocols used on the Internet and other similar networks. It is commonly known as TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol).\n\nThe act of dividing a network into at least two separate networks is called subnetting, and routers are devices that allow traffic exchange between subnetworks, serving as a physical boundary. IPv4 is the most common network addressing architecture used, though the use of IPv6 has been growing since 2006.\n\nAn IP address is comprised of a network number (routing prefix) and a rest field (host identifier). A rest field is an identifier that is specific to a given host or network interface. A routing prefix is often expressed using Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation for both IPv4 and IPv6. CIDR is a method used to create unique identifiers for networks, as well as individual devices. For IPv4, networks can also be characterized using a subnet mask, which is sometimes expressed in dot-decimal notation, as shown in the \"Subnet\" field in the calculator. All hosts on a subnetwork have the same network prefix, unlike the host identifier, which is a unique local identification. In IPv4, these subnet masks are used to differentiate the network number and host identifier. In IPv6, the network prefix performs a similar function as the subnet mask in IPv4, with the prefix length representing the number of bits in the address.\n\nPrior to the introduction of CIDR, IPv4 network prefixes could be directly obtained from the IP address based on the class (A, B, or C, which vary based on the range of IP addresses they include) of the address and the network mask. Since the introduction of CIDRs, however, assigning an IP address to a network interface requires both an address and its network mask.\n\nBelow is a table providing typical subnets for IPv4."

Colocation America’s IP Calculator will answer all your nerdy IP questions! \n\n\n\nHere are some examples to use: \n\n\n\nIPv4: 192.168.0.1/24 IPv6: 2002:0BD8::/32 Subnet mask: 192.0.2.0/255.255.255.0 Wildcard subnet mask: 192.0.2.0/0.0.0.255 IPv4 Range: 192.0.2.0-192.0.2.254 IPv6 Range: Currently our calculator doesn’t support IPv6 ranges, but it will soon! \n\n\n\nWhen you’re entering a /X, make sure there’s no space inbetween the “/” and the IP Address. Happy Calculating!\n\nIf you're looking for some quick information for questions like \"How many IPs are in a /24?\" please click here!\n\nWhy Is an IP Range / Subnet Mask Calculator Useful?\n\nIf you ever tried to do some IP network calculations by hand you were probably in school and wanted to rip your hair out. It's tedious, time-consuming, and—frankly—boring. It would have been nice to have one of those old-school scientific calculators which also included an IP subnet calculator, right?\n\nFortunately for you, Colocation America has your back with our IP range calculator suitable for all ages! Just plug in your IP range to figure out your subnet mask, IPv4/6 range, and the amount of usable IPs. Now, let's get into the nitty-gritty. The calculator is useful because it does the work for you. If you don't know, there are a total of 4,294,967,296 possible IP addresses in IPv4. That number jumps to over 300,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 in IPv6. If you're buying a usable block of IPs for your business, it would be tedious to calculate all the things necessary for your networking purposes by hand or ledger. One of the most useful functions of our IP calulator is the ability to show you subnet information.\n\nWhat Is a Subnet Mask Address and What's It Good For?\n\nA subnet mask boils down to \"masking\" out the host bits of your IP leaving only the Network ID visible. It can also determine the size of a subnet and, if the IP address on a subnet is known, the subnet mask is used to determine where the endpoints of the subnet are. This involves a lot of binary math. You could use our calculator or do it the long way: An example of subnet IP address is as follow: a 255.255.255.252 subnet mask has a binary mask that is 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111100. The number of 0s a binary mask has is directly related to the subnet length. Continuing from the example, the subnet for IP address length of the subnet mask 255.255.255.252 is 2. When calculating subnets and subnet masks, there are special numbers that reoccur and remembering these numbers is essential. These numbers are 255, 254, 252, 248, 240, 224, 192, and 128.\n\nThese numbers are useful for IP networking and help determine where a subnet can be properly broken up into smaller subnets.

        "document": "This article is intended as a general introduction to the concepts of Internet Protocol (IP) networks and subnetting. A glossary is included at the end of article.\n\nApplies to: Supported versions of Windows Server and Windows Client\n\n Original KB number: 164015\n\nWhen you configure the TCP/IP protocol on a Windows computer, the TCP/IP configuration settings require:\n\nTo configure TCP/IP correctly, it's necessary to understand how TCP/IP networks are addressed and divided into networks and subnetworks.\n\nThe success of TCP/IP as the network protocol of the Internet is largely because of its ability to connect together networks of different sizes and systems of different types. These networks are arbitrarily defined into three main classes (along with a few others) that have predefined sizes. Each of them can be divided into smaller subnetworks by system administrators. A subnet mask is used to divide an IP address into two parts. One part identifies the host (computer), the other part identifies the network to which it belongs. To better understand how IP addresses and subnet masks work, look at an IP address and see how it's organized.\n\nAn IP address is a 32-bit number. It uniquely identifies a host (computer or other device, such as a printer or router) on a TCP/IP network.\n\nIP addresses are normally expressed in dotted-decimal format, with four numbers separated by periods, such as 192.168.123.132. To understand how subnet masks are used to distinguish between hosts, networks, and subnetworks, examine an IP address in binary notation.\n\nFor example, the dotted-decimal IP address 192.168.123.132 is (in binary notation) the 32-bit number 11000000101010000111101110000100. This number may be hard to make sense of, so divide it into four parts of eight binary digits.\n\nThese 8-bit sections are known as octets. The example IP address, then, becomes 11000000.10101000.01111011.10000100. This number only makes a little more sense, so for most uses, convert the binary address into dotted-decimal format (192.168.123.132). The decimal numbers separated by periods are the octets converted from binary to decimal notation.\n\nFor a TCP/IP wide area network (WAN) to work efficiently as a collection of networks, the routers that pass packets of data between networks don't know the exact location of a host for which a packet of information is destined. Routers only know what network the host is a member of and use information stored in their route table to determine how to get the packet to the destination host's network. After the packet is delivered to the destination's network, the packet is delivered to the appropriate host.\n\nFor this process to work, an IP address has two parts. The first part of an IP address is used as a network address, the last part as a host address. If you take the example 192.168.123.132 and divide it into these two parts, you get 192.168.123. Network .132 Host or 192.168.123.0 - network address. 0.0.0.132 - host address.\n\nThe second item, which is required for TCP/IP to work, is the subnet mask. The subnet mask is used by the TCP/IP protocol to determine whether a host is on the local subnet or on a remote network.\n\nIn TCP/IP, the parts of the IP address that are used as the network and host addresses aren't fixed. Unless you have more information, the network and host addresses above can't be determined. This information is supplied in another 32-bit number called a subnet mask. The subnet mask is 255.255.255.0 in this example. It isn't obvious what this number means unless you know 255 in binary notation equals 11111111. So, the subnet mask is 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000.\n\nLining up the IP address and the subnet mask together, the network, and host portions of the address can be separated:\n\nThe first 24 bits (the number of ones in the subnet mask) are identified as the network address. The last 8 bits (the number of remaining zeros in the subnet mask) are identified as the host address. It gives you the following addresses:\n\nSo now you know, for this example using a 255.255.255.0 subnet mask, that the network ID is 192.168.123.0, and the host address is 0.0.0.132. When a packet arrives on the 192.168.123.0 subnet (from the local subnet or a remote network), and it has a destination address of 192.168.123.132, your computer will receive it from the network and process it.\n\nAlmost all decimal subnet masks convert to binary numbers that are all ones on the left and all zeros on the right. Some other common subnet masks are:\n\nInternet RFC 1878 describes the valid subnets and subnet masks that can be used on TCP/IP networks.\n\nIP addresses are allocated by the InterNIC, the organization that administers the Internet. These IP addresses are divided into classes. The most common of them are classes A, B, and C. Classes D and E exist, but aren't used by end users. Each of the address classes has a different default subnet mask. You can identify the class of an IP address by looking at its first octet. Following are the ranges of Class A, B, and C IP addresses, each with an example address:\n• None Class A networks use a default subnet mask of 255.0.0.0 and have 0-127 as their first octet. The address 10.52.36.11 is a class A address. Its first octet is 10, which is between 0 and 127, inclusive.\n• None Class B networks use a default subnet mask of 255.255.0.0 and have 128-191 as their first octet. The address 172.16.52.63 is a class B address. Its first octet is 172, which is between 128 and 191, inclusive.\n• None Class C networks use a default subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 and have 192-223 as their first octet. The address 192.168.123.132 is a class C address. Its first octet is 192, which is between 192 and 223, inclusive.\n\nIn some scenarios, the default subnet mask values don't fit the organization needs for one of the following reasons:\n• The physical topology of the network\n• The numbers of networks (or hosts) don't fit within the default subnet mask restrictions.\n\nThe next section explains how networks can be divided using subnet masks.\n\nA Class A, B, or C TCP/IP network can be further divided, or subnetted, by a system administrator. It becomes necessary as you reconcile the logical address scheme of the Internet (the abstract world of IP addresses and subnets) with the physical networks in use by the real world.\n\nA system administrator who is allocated a block of IP addresses may be administering networks that aren't organized in a way that easily fits these addresses. For example, you have a wide area network with 150 hosts on three networks (in different cities) that are connected by a TCP/IP router. Each of these three networks has 50 hosts. You are allocated the class C network 192.168.123.0. (For illustration, this address is actually from a range that isn't allocated on the Internet.) It means that you can use the addresses 192.168.123.1 to 192.168.123.254 for your 150 hosts.\n\nTwo addresses that can't be used in your example are 192.168.123.0 and 192.168.123.255 because binary addresses with a host portion of all ones and all zeros are invalid. The zero address is invalid because it's used to specify a network without specifying a host. The 255 address (in binary notation, a host address of all ones) is used to broadcast a message to every host on a network. Just remember that the first and last address in any network or subnet can't be assigned to any individual host.\n\nYou should now be able to give IP addresses to 254 hosts. It works fine if all 150 computers are on a single network. However, your 150 computers are on three separate physical networks. Instead of requesting more address blocks for each network, you divide your network into subnets that enable you to use one block of addresses on multiple physical networks.\n\nIn this case, you divide your network into four subnets by using a subnet mask that makes the network address larger and the possible range of host addresses smaller. In other words, you are 'borrowing' some of the bits used for the host address, and using them for the network portion of the address. The subnet mask 255.255.255.192 gives you four networks of 62 hosts each. It works because in binary notation, 255.255.255.192 is the same as 1111111.11111111.1111111.11000000. The first two digits of the last octet become network addresses, so you get the additional networks 00000000 (0), 01000000 (64), 10000000 (128) and 11000000 (192). (Some administrators will only use two of the subnetworks using 255.255.255.192 as a subnet mask. For more information on this topic, see RFC 1878.) In these four networks, the last six binary digits can be used for host addresses.\n\nUsing a subnet mask of 255.255.255.192, your 192.168.123.0 network then becomes the four networks 192.168.123.0, 192.168.123.64, 192.168.123.128 and 192.168.123.192. These four networks would have as valid host addresses:\n\nRemember, again, that binary host addresses with all ones or all zeros are invalid, so you can't use addresses with the last octet of 0, 63, 64, 127, 128, 191, 192, or 255.\n\nYou can see how it works by looking at two host addresses, 192.168.123.71 and 192.168.123.133. If you used the default Class C subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, both addresses are on the 192.168.123.0 network. However, if you use the subnet mask of 255.255.255.192, they are on different networks; 192.168.123.71 is on the 192.168.123.64 network, 192.168.123.133 is on the 192.168.123.128 network.\n\nIf a TCP/IP computer needs to communicate with a host on another network, it will usually communicate through a device called a router. In TCP/IP terms, a router that is specified on a host, which links the host's subnet to other networks, is called a default gateway. This section explains how TCP/IP determines whether or not to send packets to its default gateway to reach another computer or device on the network.\n\nWhen a host attempts to communicate with another device using TCP/IP, it performs a comparison process using the defined subnet mask and the destination IP address versus the subnet mask and its own IP address. The result of this comparison tells the computer whether the destination is a local host or a remote host.\n\nIf the result of this process determines the destination to be a local host, then the computer will send the packet on the local subnet. If the result of the comparison determines the destination to be a remote host, then the computer will forward the packet to the default gateway defined in its TCP/IP properties. It's then the responsibility of the router to forward the packet to the correct subnet.\n\nTCP/IP network problems are often caused by incorrect configuration of the three main entries in a computer's TCP/IP properties. By understanding how errors in TCP/IP configuration affect network operations, you can solve many common TCP/IP problems.\n\nIf a network uses a subnet mask other than the default mask for its address class, and a client is still configured with the default subnet mask for the address class, communication will fail to some nearby networks but not to distant ones.\n\nAs an example, if you create four subnets (such as in the subnetting example) but use the incorrect subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 in your TCP/IP configuration, hosts won't be able to determine that some computers are on different subnets than their own. In this situation, packets destined for hosts on different physical networks that are part of the same Class C address won't be sent to a default gateway for delivery.\n\nA common symptom of this issue is when a computer can communicate with hosts that are on its local network and can talk to all remote networks except those networks that are nearby and have the same class A, B, or C address. To fix this problem, just enter the correct subnet mask in the TCP/IP configuration for that host.\n\nIf you put computers with IP addresses that should be on separate subnets on a local network with each other, they won't be able to communicate. They'll try to send packets to each other through a router that can't forward them correctly. A symptom of this problem is a computer that can talk to hosts on remote networks but can't communicate with some or all computers on their local network.\n\nTo correct this problem, make sure all computers on the same physical network have IP addresses on the same IP subnet. If you run out of IP addresses on a single network segment, there are solutions that go beyond the scope of this article.\n\nA computer configured with an incorrect default gateway can communicate with hosts on its own network segment. But it will fail to communicate with hosts on some or all remote networks. A host can communicate with some remote networks but not others if the following conditions are true:\n• A single physical network has more than one router.\n• The wrong router is configured as a default gateway.\n\nThis problem is common if an organization has a router to an internal TCP/IP network and another router connected to the Internet.\n\nTwo popular references on TCP/IP are:\n\nIt is recommended that a system administrator responsible for TCP/IP networks have at least one of these references available.\n• None Broadcast address--An IP address with a host portion that is all ones.\n• None Host--A computer or other device on a TCP/IP network.\n• None Internet--The global collection of networks that are connected together and share a common range of IP addresses.\n• None InterNIC--The organization responsible for administration of IP addresses on the Internet.\n• None IP--The network protocol used for sending network packets over a TCP/IP network or the Internet.\n• None IP Address--A unique 32-bit address for a host on a TCP/IP network or internetwork.\n• None Network--There are two uses of the term network in this article.

        "document": "Network devices use IP addresses and subnets to identify the source and destination of communications and manage network addresses respectively.\n\nIP addresses contain two parts: a network identifier and a host identifier. The network ID specifies an area of the network where a device resides, much like an area code identifies a section of a telephone network. The host ID labels a specific device in that network section, similar to how a telephone number identifies a specific phone within an area code.\n\nMost business networks still rely on IP version 4 (IPv4) addresses, which offer about 4.3 billion unique variations. Internet identities use most of these, but the newer IP version 6 (IPv6) standard provides more addresses and other benefits.\n\nComputers work with IPv4 addresses as 32-bit binary strings. Humans usually convert binary to a dotted decimal address, which is easier to write and understand. For example, the binary string 11000000.00000000.00000010.00000010 converts to the IP address 192.0.2.2. Its associated subnet mask converts from 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111100 to 255.255.255.252.\n\nSubnet masks clarify which part of the address is the network ID and which is the host ID. Routers, computers and network troubleshooters use IP addresses and subnet masks to manage network traffic, which ensures information sent from one system arrives at its destination.\n\nNetwork devices typically have the following three identities:\n• Hostname. Useful for humans to recognize the device. A workstation has three identities: hostname, IP address and MAC address. In the case of IPv4 addresses, each host has a unique IP address on the network, and nodes rely on it to exchange information. Data breaks down into pieces, known as packets, which then travel across the network. Each packet contains a source and destination IP address, much like postal service mail includes a destination and return address on the envelope. Source and destination IP addresses are much like sender and receiver addresses on envelopes. Administrators can subdivide networks into smaller, more manageable sections. This process lets them control the flow of network traffic, isolate traffic to increase security and limit traffic to certain areas of the network to improve performance. These network segments are called subnetworks, or subnets. Each subnet has a unique identifier within the larger network ID. When administrators divide a network into parts, such as engineering and finance, the address structure is based on numbers. Two network segments, each with its own network ID. Systems and sites on the public internet consume most of the roughly 4.3 billion available IPv4 addresses. However, private networks can reserve some ranges for internal use. Networks in home offices and businesses likely use one of these ranges.\n\nConfusion arises between the terms subnet and subnet mask. Subnets are an isolated network segment, which is a piece of the network that an administrator divides off. Network administrators typically create subnets for the following reasons: Subnets created for security purposes prevent specific traffic types from traversing the rest of the network, where they could be vulnerable to interception. For example, network administrators might isolate all computers in the finance department to a single subnet, which effectively prevents finance network communications from moving across the entire network. Subnets for performance decrease competition for network access on congested networks. If an organization's engineering department regularly transfers files that affect network performance for other users, network administrators can isolate the engineers to their own subnet, which reduces the effect of their file transfers on other users. Network administrators often define multiple subnets for both security and performance reasons. Subnet masks, on the other hand, play a different role. Network devices use the subnet mask to determine which part of a host's IP address is the network ID and which part is the host ID. Subnet masks are always used with IP addresses. Essentially, subnets are an area of the network, while subnet masks help devices determine the network area to which they belong.\n\nIPv4 addresses divide into five classes. The primary difference between the first three classes -- Class A, Class B and Class C -- is the number of subnets versus the number of hosts per subnet. The following table outlines the details between IP address classes. Many networks with fewer hosts per network. Class D addresses are for a specific type of communication known as multicasting, which lets a host transmit thousands of data streams to other devices. Class E also isn't used with standard IPv4 networking. Instead, IP address researchers use Class E addresses for experimental and developmental purposes. This classification system is known as classful addressing. Classful addressing relies on rigid divisions between the network ID and host ID. These divisions always occur at the eighth, 16th or 24th bits in the address. This design often wastes addresses, however. For example, Class B networks provide 65,000 host IDs, and Class C networks offer only 254 host IDs. If a network has 2,000 devices, and administrators select Class B, they could waste around 63,000 addresses. Classless addressing, on the other hand, lets network administrators define network IDs at any point for more efficient use of the available addresses. For example, to satisfy a network with 2,000 host IDs, administrators can use a subnet mask of 255.255.248.0/21 to provide 2,048 total host IDs. The extra number at the end of the subnet mask is called a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation, which specifies a number of bits in the subnet mask. This method lets admins add more IP addresses without using a different class. The following table shows examples of subnet masks, their corresponding CIDR notations and the number of total IP addresses per subnet.\n\nNetwork administrators often face two common IP address troubleshooting scenarios: misconfiguration and an inability to communicate with an essential network service. Network administrators can manually configure some devices, such as servers, routers and printers, with an IP address, subnet mask and other network settings. However, any typographical error in these settings prevents the device from communicating correctly on the network. One of the first network troubleshooting steps is to verify these settings, including the subnet mask. Network administrators should update subnet masks with valid settings if they're incorrect. The following table lists commands that display IP address settings on three popular OSes. Most client workstations, tablets, smartphones and other devices receive their IP address configuration from a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server. This server stores a pool of available IP address settings and leases addresses to client devices. A properly configured DHCP server doesn't make any typographical errors. However, if the client system can't reach the DHCP server, it doesn't receive an IP address configuration. It assigns itself a default configuration with Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA). APIPA addresses begin with 169.254. The configuration won't communicate correctly on most networks, so network administrators should investigate why the client can't reach the DHCP server if this occurs. One reason, for example, could be that the server is down.\n\nIP addresses and subnet masks are fundamental components of network communications. Each network node has a unique IP address consisting of a network identifier and a host identifier. Depending on the network design, these identifiers aren't universally consistent. Subnet masks help the system and administrators determine which part of the IP address is the network ID and which is the host ID. Network administrators typically check these network settings first during troubleshooting. Network administrators divide larger networks into subnets, and a device's IP address and subnet mask indicate the network section to which it belongs. Administrators use subnets to isolate traffic for security and performance. Most business networks still rely on IPv4, which uses five classes to distinguish various IP address ranges. Classes A, B and C are common on most internal networks. Network professionals must understand their network design to use tools like ipconfig, , and to troubleshoot communication issues.

        "document": "In my last Daily Drill Down, we went step-by-step through subnetting a Class C network address. Be sure you have read the previous two Daily Drill Downs, which discussed IP addressing and subnetting, before reading this Daily Drill Down.\n\nIn this Daily Drill Down, we will continue to subnet IP addresses, but we will use Class B network addresses. Class B network addresses provide us with more subnet and host bits to manipulate, which can be fun, not painful, when it is done correctly.\n\nClass B subnets\n\n In my last Daily Drill Down, we borrowed bits from the host portion of a Class C network address. Class C network addresses only have eight bits to manipulate into subnets. However, a Class B has 16 bits to play with. This will allow more subnets with more hosts per subnet than a Class C network ever could.\n\nTable 1 lists all of the possible Class B subnets:\n\nThere are quite a few more masks we can use with a Class B network address than we can with a Class C network address. Remember that this is not harder than subnetting with Class C, but it can get confusing if you don’t pay attention to where the subnet bits and host bits are in a mask. This takes practice!\n\nIn this Daily Drill Down, I will use the same techniques I used in the Class C article to subnet a network. We’ll start with the Class B subnet mask of 255.255.192.0 and figure out the subnets, broadcast address, and valid host range. We will answer the same five questions we answered for the Class C subnet masks:\n• How many subnets does this mask provide?\n• How many hosts per subnet does this mask provide?\n• What are the valid subnets?\n• What is the broadcast address for each subnet?\n• What is the host range of each subnet?\n\nBefore we answer these questions, there is one difference you need to be aware of when subnetting a Class B network address. When subnetting in the third octet, you need to add the fourth octet. For example, on the 255.255.192.0 mask, the subnetting will be done in the third octet. To create a valid subnet, you must add the fourth octet of all 0s and all 1s for the network and broadcast address (0 for all 0s and 255 for all 1s).\n\nExample 1: Answers for the 255.255.192.0 mask\n• Broadcast for the 64.0 subnet is 127.255. Broadcast for the 128.0 subnet is 191.255.\n\nNotice that the numbers in the third octet are the same numbers we used in the fourth octet when subnetting the 192 mask. The only difference is that we add 0 and 255 in the fourth octet.\n\nFor the 64.0 subnet, all the hosts between 64.1 and 127.254 are in the 64 subnet. In the 128.0 subnet, the hosts are 128.1 through 191.254.\n\nI know this is confusing, but I promise if you read this complete Daily Drill Down carefully, I can make it easier for you.\n\nWork through a few more with me, and it should start to become clearer.\n• Broadcast for the 16.0 subnet is 31.255. Broadcast for the 32.0 subnet is 47.255, etc.\n• Broadcast for the 8.0 subnet is 15.255. Broadcast for the 16.0 subnet is 23.255, etc.\n• Broadcast for the 4.0 subnet is 7.255. Broadcast for the 8.0 subnet is 11.255, etc.\n• Broadcast for the 1.0 subnet is 1.255. Broadcast for the 2.0 subnet is 2.255, etc.\n\nThat last example was pretty simple. I hope you notice a pattern now. All the numbers were basically the same except we added the fourth octet into the address.\n\nThe more difficult process of subnetting a Class B network address is when you start using bits in the fourth octet for subnetting. For example, what happens when you use this mask with a Class B network address: 255.255.255.128? Is that valid? Absolutely! There are nine bits for subnetting and seven bits for hosts. That is 510 subnets, each with 126 hosts. However, it is the most difficult mask to figure out the valid hosts for.\n• For the third octet, the mask would be 256-255=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc.\n• For the fourth octet, the mask would be 256-128=128, which is one subnet if it is used. However, if you turn the subnet bit off, the value is 0. This means that for every subnet in the third octet, the fourth octet has two subnets: 0 and 128, for example 1.0 and 1.128.\n• Broadcast for the 0.128 subnet is 128.255; the broadcast for the 1.0 subnet is 1.127. Broadcast for the 1.128 subnet is 1.255, etc.\n\nThe thing to remember is that for every subnet in the third octet, there are two in the fourth octet: 0 and 128. For the 0 subnet, the broadcast address is always 127. For the 128 subnet, the broadcast address is always 255.\n\nLet’s continue with more subnetting into the fourth octet. This is exactly like subnetting a Class C network address, but the third octet is part of the subnet address.\n• 256-255=1.0, 2.0, 3.0, etc. for the third octet. 256-192=64, 128, 192 for the fourth octet. For every valid subnet in the third octet, we get four subnets in the fourth octet: 0, 64, 128, and 192.\n• Broadcast for the 1.0 subnet is 1.63, since the next subnet is 1.64. Broadcast for the 1.64 subnet is 1.127, since the next subnet is 1.128. Broadcast for the 1.128 subnet is 1.191, since the next subnet is 1.192. Broadcast for the 1.192 subnet is 1.255.\n• The valid hosts are as follows:\n\nOn this one, the 0 and 192 subnets are valid, since we are using the third octet as well. The subnet range is 0.64 through 255.128. 0.0 is not valid since no subnet bits are on. 255.192 is not valid because then all subnet bits would be on.\n• 256-255=1.0, 2.0, 3.0, etc. for the third octet. 256-224=32, 64, 96, 128, 160, 192 for the subnet value. (For every value in the third octet, we get eight subnets in the fourth octet: 0, 32, 64, 96, 128, 160, 192, 224.)\n• Broadcast for the 1.0 subnet is 1.63, since the next subnet is 1.64. Broadcast for the 1.64 subnet is 1.127, since the next subnet is 1.128. Broadcast for the 1.128 subnet is 1.191, since the next subnet is 1.192. Broadcast for the 1.192 subnet is 1.255.\n\nFor this subnet mask, the 0 and 224 subnets are valid as long as not all subnet bits in the third octet are off or all subnet bits in the fourth octet are on.\n\nWhen would we use this valuable information? All the time! For example, if you have a host configuration of 172.16.10.33 255.255.255.224, what subnet, broadcast address, and valid host range is this host a member of? (We would solve this question with the information presented above.)\n\n 256-224=32, 64\n\nBingo! In the fourth octet, the host address is 33. That is between 32 and 64, so the host is in the 32 subnet, which has a broadcast address of 63, and the valid host range is 33-62. Easy. Just remember that the subnet is 10.32 because the third octet is part of the subnet address.\n\nLet’s try another one. You have a host configuration of 172.16.10.33 255.255.255.240. What subnet, broadcast address, and valid host range is this host a member of?\n\nSince we did not go through this mask in this Daily Drill Down, you’ll have to figure it out on your own. It is done the same way as all the others.\n\n 256-240=16, 32, 48\n\nBingo! The host is in the 10.32 subnet, which has a broadcast address of 10.47 and a valid host range of 10.33 through 10.46.\n\nLet’s keep going: You have a host configuration of 172.16.10.33 255.255.255.248. What subnet, broadcast address, and valid host range is this host a member of?\n\n 256-248=8, 16, 24, 32, 40\n\nBingo! The host is in the 10.32 subnet, which has a broadcast address of 10.39 and valid host range of 10.33 through 10.38. Easy, huh?\n\nOne more: You have a host configuration of 172.16.10.17 255.255.255.252. What subnet, broadcast address, and valid host range is this host a member of?\n\n 256-252=4, 8, 12, 16, 20\n\nBingo! You have a subnet of 10.16, with a broadcast of 10.19 and valid host range of 10.17 through 10.18.\n\nConclusion\n\n This Daily Drill Down presented a continuation of IP addressing and subnetting, which has taken many Daily Drill Downs to discuss. I am still not done! My future Daily Drill Downs will discuss IP routing, which is the process of fragmenting packets of data and switching them through an internetwork.\n\nTo continue on with IP routing, you must have a fundamental understanding of the devices that work at each layer as well as IP addressing and subnetting. Look back and read my past Daily Drill Downs that include both Layer 2 and Layer 3 switching. For more in-depth information, please see my Sybex CCNA Study Guide."

        "document": "Let's take example of a Class B Network 172.16.0.1/16. We will subnet this network from 172.16.0.0/16 till 172.16.0.254/30. Kindly note that default subnet mask of Class B is /16 (or 255.255.0.0).\n\n\n\nKindly note that subnet mask 255.255.0.0 can be written as /16. We can write /16 in binary as 11111111.11111111. 00000000.00000000. Here, number of 1s is 16 and we use this value to denote the subnet mask as /16. In Class B network shown above, we will have 16 Network bits (1s) and 16 host bits (0s) and using subnetting we will extend the network portion from 172.16.0.0/16 till 172.16.0.0/30. \n\n Let's begin subnetting by borrowing 1 bit (Most significant bit) from host portion and use it in the network portion. The subnet mask will become /17 (previous value was /16).\n\n\n\nAlso note that the last 2 octets (3 and 4 octets) of network 172.16.0.0 can be written as 00000000.00000000\n\n\n\nWhile we change subnet mask from /16 to /17, the binary value of 3 octet of subnet mask can be written as 10000000 while the binary value of 4 octet will remain 00000000. The Decimal value of subnet mask will become 255.255.128.0, because the decimal value of 10000000 in 3 Octet is 128.\n\n\n\nLet assume the number of bits we have made turned '1' or borrowed = N( ex. Network bit), so here N= 1\n\n\n\nLet assume the number of bits left zero(remaining) = H (ex. Host bit), so here H = 15.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe binary format of 3 and 4 octet will be : 10000000.00000000 (7 bits of 3 Octet are 0 and all 8 bits of 4 octet are 0.
