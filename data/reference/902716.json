The main idea of asymptotic analysis is to have a measure of the efficiency of algorithms that don’t depend on machine-specific constants and don’t require algorithms to be implemented and time taken by programs to be compared. Asymptotic notations are mathematical tools to represent the time complexity of algorithms for asymptotic analysis.\n• None Asymptotic Notations are mathematical tools used to analyze the performance of algorithms by understanding how their efficiency changes as the input size grows.\n• None These notations provide a concise way to express the behavior of an algorithm’s time or space complexity as the input size approaches infinity.\n• None Rather than comparing algorithms directly, asymptotic analysis focuses on understanding the relative growth rates of algorithms’ complexities.\n• None It enables comparisons of algorithms’ efficiency by abstracting away machine-specific constants and implementation details, focusing instead on fundamental trends.\n• None Asymptotic analysis allows for the comparison of algorithms’ space and time complexities by examining their performance characteristics as the input size varies.\n• None By using asymptotic notations, such as Big O, Big Omega, and Big Theta, we can categorize algorithms based on their worst-case, best-case, or average-case time or space complexities, providing valuable insights into their efficiency.\n\nTheta notation encloses the function from above and below. Since it represents the upper and the lower bound of the running time of an algorithm, it is used for analyzing the average-case complexity of an algorithm. .Theta (Average Case) You add the running times for each possible input combination and take the average in the average case.\n\nLet g and f be the function from the set of natural numbers to itself. The function f is said to be Θ(g), if there are constants c1, c2 > 0 and a natural number n0 such that c1* g(n) ≤ f(n) ≤ c2 * g(n) for all n ≥ n0\n\nThe above expression can be described as if f(n) is theta of g(n), then the value f(n) is always between c1 * g(n) and c2 * g(n) for large values of n (n ≥ n0). The definition of theta also requires that f(n) must be non-negative for values of n greater than n0.\n\nThe execution time serves as both a lower and upper bound on the algorithm’s time complexity.\n\nIt exist as both, most, and least boundaries for a given input value.\n\nA simple way to get the Theta notation of an expression is to drop low-order terms and ignore leading constants. For example, Consider the expression 3n3 + 6n2 + 6000 = Θ(n3), the dropping lower order terms is always fine because there will always be a number(n) after which Θ(n3) has higher values than Θ(n2) irrespective of the constants involved. For a given function g(n), we denote Θ(g(n)) is following set of functions.\n\nIf f(n) describes the running time of an algorithm, f(n) is O(g(n)) if there exist a positive constant C and n0 such that, 0 ≤ f(n) ≤ cg(n) for all n ≥ n0\n\nIt returns the highest possible output value (big-O)for a given input.\n\nThe execution time serves as an upper bound on the algorithm’s time complexity.\n\nFor example, Consider the case of Insertion Sort. It takes linear time in the best case and quadratic time in the worst case. We can safely say that the time complexity of the Insertion sort is O(n2). \n\nNote: O(n2) also covers linear time.\n\nIf we use Θ notation to represent the time complexity of Insertion sort, we have to use two statements for best and worst cases:\n• None The worst-case time complexity of Insertion Sort is Θ(n\n• None The best case time complexity of Insertion Sort is Θ(n).\n\nThe Big-O notation is useful when we only have an upper bound on the time complexity of an algorithm. Many times we easily find an upper bound by simply looking at the algorithm.\n\nThe execution time serves as a lower bound on the algorithm’s time complexity.\n\nIt is defined as the condition that allows an algorithm to complete statement execution in the shortest amount of time.\n\nLet g and f be the function from the set of natural numbers to itself. The function f is said to be Ω(g), if there is a constant c > 0 and a natural number n0 such that c*g(n) ≤ f(n) for all n ≥ n0\n\nLet us consider the same Insertion sort example here. The time complexity of Insertion Sort can be written as Ω(n), but it is not very useful information about insertion sort, as we are generally interested in worst-case and sometimes in the average case.\n\nIf f(n) is O(g(n)) then a*f(n) is also O(g(n)), where a is a constant.\n\nWe can say,\n\nIf f(n) is O(g(n)) and g(n) is O(h(n)) then f(n) = O(h(n)).\n\nWe can say,\n\nReflexive properties are always easy to understand after transitive.\n\nIf f(n) is given then f(n) is O(f(n)). Since MAXIMUM VALUE OF f(n) will be f(n) ITSELF!\n\nHence x = f(n) and y = O(f(n) tie themselves in reflexive relation always.\n\nWe can say that,\n\nIf f(n) is Θ(g(n)) then g(n) is Θ(f(n)).\n\nIf f(n) is O(g(n)) then g(n) is Ω (f(n)).\n\n1. If f(n) = O(g(n)) and f(n) = Ω(g(n)) then f(n) = Θ(g(n))\n\n2. If f(n) = O(g(n)) and d(n)=O(e(n)) then f(n) + d(n) = O( max( g(n), e(n) ))\n\n3. If f(n)=O(g(n)) and d(n)=O(e(n)) then f(n) * d(n) = O( g(n) * e(n))\n• None There are two more notations called little o and little omega . Little o provides a strict upper bound (equality condition is removed from Big O) and little omega provides strict lower bound (equality condition removed from big omega)\n\nFor more details, please refer: Design and Analysis of Algorithms."

        "document": "What are they?\n\nAsymptotic Notations are languages that allow us to analyze an algorithm's running time by identifying its behavior as the input size for the algorithm increases. This is also known as an algorithm's growth rate. Does the algorithm suddenly become incredibly slow when the input size grows? Does it mostly maintain its quick run time as the input size increases? Asymptotic Notation gives us the ability to answer these questions.\n\nAre there alternatives to answering these questions?\n\nOne way would be to count the number of primitive operations at different input sizes. Though this is a valid solution, the amount of work this takes for even simple algorithms does not justify its use.\n\nAnother way is to physically measure the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete given different input sizes. However, the accuracy and relativity (times obtained would only be relative to the machine they were computed on) of this method is bound to environmental variables such as computer hardware specifications, processing power, etc.\n\nIn the first section of this doc, we described how an Asymptotic Notation identifies the behavior of an algorithm as the input size changes. Let us imagine an algorithm as a function f, n as the input size, and f(n) being the running time. So for a given algorithm f, with input size n you get some resultant run time f(n). This results in a graph where the Y-axis is the runtime, the X-axis is the input size, and plot points are the resultants of the amount of time for a given input size.\n\nYou can label a function, or algorithm, with an Asymptotic Notation in many different ways. Some examples are, you can describe an algorithm by its best case, worst case, or average case. The most common is to analyze an algorithm by its worst case. You typically don’t evaluate by best case because those conditions aren’t what you’re planning for. An excellent example of this is sorting algorithms; particularly, adding elements to a tree structure. The best case for most algorithms could be as low as a single operation. However, in most cases, the element you’re adding needs to be sorted appropriately through the tree, which could mean examining an entire branch. This is the worst case, and this is what we plan for.\n\nThese are some fundamental function growth classifications used in various notations. The list starts at the slowest growing function (logarithmic, fastest execution time) and goes on to the fastest growing (exponential, slowest execution time). Notice that as ‘n’ or the input, increases in each of those functions, the result increases much quicker in quadratic, polynomial, and exponential, compared to logarithmic and linear.\n\nIt is worth noting that for the notations about to be discussed, you should do your best to use the simplest terms. This means to disregard constants, and lower order terms, because as the input size (or n in our f(n) example) increases to infinity (mathematical limits), the lower order terms and constants are of little to no importance. That being said, if you have constants that are 2^9001, or some other ridiculous, unimaginable amount, realize that simplifying skew your notation accuracy.\n\nSince we want simplest form, lets modify our table a bit...\n\nBig-O, commonly written as O, is an Asymptotic Notation for the worst case, or ceiling of growth for a given function. It provides us with an asymptotic upper bound for the growth rate of the runtime of an algorithm. Say is your algorithm runtime, and is an arbitrary time complexity you are trying to relate to your algorithm. is O(g(n)), if for some real constants c (c > 0) and n , <= for every input size n (n > n ).\n\nIs O(g(n))? Is O(log n)? Let's look to the definition of Big-O.\n\nIs there some pair of constants c, n that satisfies this for all n > n ?\n\nYes! The definition of Big-O has been met therefore is O(g(n)).\n\nIs O(g(n))? Is O(n)? Let's look at the definition of Big-O.\n\nIs there some pair of constants c, n that satisfies this for all n > n ? No, there isn't. is NOT O(g(n)).\n\nBig-Omega, commonly written as Ω, is an Asymptotic Notation for the best case, or a floor growth rate for a given function. It provides us with an asymptotic lower bound for the growth rate of the runtime of an algorithm.\n\nis Ω(g(n)), if for some real constants c (c > 0) and n (n > 0), is >= for every input size n (n > n ).\n\nThe asymptotic growth rates provided by big-O and big-omega notation may or may not be asymptotically tight. Thus we use small-o and small-omega notation to denote bounds that are not asymptotically tight.\n\nSmall-o, commonly written as o, is an Asymptotic Notation to denote the upper bound (that is not asymptotically tight) on the growth rate of runtime of an algorithm.\n\nis o(g(n)), if for all real constants c (c > 0) and n (n > 0), is < for every input size n (n > n ).\n\nThe definitions of O-notation and o-notation are similar. The main difference is that in f(n) = O(g(n)), the bound f(n) <= g(n) holds for some constant c > 0, but in f(n) = o(g(n)), the bound f(n) < c g(n) holds for all constants c > 0.\n\nSmall-omega, commonly written as ω, is an Asymptotic Notation to denote the lower bound (that is not asymptotically tight) on the growth rate of runtime of an algorithm.\n\nis ω(g(n)), if for all real constants c (c > 0) and n (n > 0), is > for every input size n (n > n ).\n\nThe definitions of Ω-notation and ω-notation are similar. The main difference is that in f(n) = Ω(g(n)), the bound f(n) >= g(n) holds for some constant c > 0, but in f(n) = ω(g(n)), the bound f(n) > c g(n) holds for all constants c > 0.\n\nTheta, commonly written as Θ, is an Asymptotic Notation to denote the asymptotically tight bound on the growth rate of runtime of an algorithm.\n\nis Θ(g(n)), if for some real constants c1, c2 and n (c1 > 0, c2 > 0, n > 0), is < is < for every input size n (n > n ).\n\n∴ is Θ(g(n)) implies is O(g(n)) as well as is Ω(g(n)).\n\nFeel free to head over to additional resources for examples on this. Big-O is the primary notation use for general algorithm time complexity.\n\nIt's hard to keep this kind of topic short, and you should go through the books and online resources listed. They go into much greater depth with definitions and examples. More where x='Algorithms & Data Structures' is on its way; we'll have a doc up on analyzing actual code examples soon.\n\nGot a suggestion? A correction, perhaps?

There are many problems with this approach for the analysis of algorithms.\n• None It might be possible that for some inputs , the first algorithm performs better than the second. And for some inputs\n• None It might also be possible that for some inputs, the first algorithm performs better on one machine , and the second works better on another machine for some other inputs.\n\nFor example, let us consider the search problem (searching a given item) in a sorted array.\n\nThe solution to above search problem includes:\n\nTo understand how Asymptotic Analysis solves the problems mentioned above in analyzing algorithms,\n• None let us say:\n• None We run the Linear Search on a fast computer A and\n• None For small values of input array size n, the fast computer may take less time.\n• None But, after a certain value of input array size, the Binary Search will definitely start taking less time compared to the Linear Search even though the Binary Search is being run on a slow machine. Why? After certain value, the machine specific factors would not matter as the value of input would become large.\n• None The reason is the order of growth of Binary Search with respect to input size is logarithmic while the order of growth of Linear Search is linear.\n• So the machine-dependent constants can always be ignored after a certain value of input size.\n• None Let’s say the constant for machine A is 0.2 and the constant for B is 1000 which means that A is 5000 times more powerful than B.\n\nRunning times for this example:\n\nAsymptotic Analysis is not perfect, but that’s the best way available for analyzing algorithms. For example, say there are two sorting algorithms that take 1000nLogn and 2nLogn time respectively on a machine. Both of these algorithms are asymptotically the same (order of growth is nLogn). So, With Asymptotic Analysis, we can’t judge which one is better as we ignore constants in Asymptotic Analysis. For example, asymptotically Heap Sort is better than Quick Sort, but Quick Sort takes less time in practice.\n\nAlso, in Asymptotic analysis, we always talk about input sizes larger than a constant value. It might be possible that those large inputs are never given to your software and an asymptotically slower algorithm always performs better for your particular situation. So, you may end up choosing an algorithm that is Asymptotically slower but faster for your software."

        "document": "I recently graduated from Flatiron’s Full Stack program and I have become very confident finding the brute force solution for most white boarding problems. Problem solving has always been a strength of mine. I understand how to break a big problem into bite size problems, find solutions to the small problems to ultimately solve the big one. That’s all great and peachy, but then it comes time to refactor.\n\nWorking code is great! However, code takes time to run and ideally we want our code to execute quickly to provide a positive user experience. In this blog post, I am going to break down Big O Notation and why it’s so important.\n\nLet’s walk through an example.\n\nI was presented this problem in a mock technical interview.\n\nLet’s pretend we’re boarding a flight. We are given a flight length (an integer, ex. 160) and an array of movies represented by their runtime( ex. [55,85,90,60,75]. We want to write a function that will return true or false depending if there are two different movies that add up to exactly the flight length.\n\nI quickly coded a brute force solution (with a nested loop) that looked something like this:\n\nIn the solution above we iterate through the movies array. For each element, we define the remainder (the matching value required to return true) and the remainingMovies array (a new array of the movies after the current element, since the current element would have already been compared to all elements prior). We use the find enumerable to check for a match and returned true if find was successful.\n\nAfter running our nested loops, if a match is not found, the function returns false.\n\nThis works, but let’s talk about Big O Notation and how we can refactor.\n\nLet’s take a quick look at 4 common time complexities that Big O Notation refers to.\n• O(1) — Constant time complexity. An algorithm always takes the same amount of time to execute.\n• O(log n) — Logarithmic time complexity. The time it takes to run the algorithm is proportional to the logarithm of the input size n.\n• O(n) — Linear time complexity. The amount of time it takes for an algorithm to execute is directly proportional to the input size n.\n• O(n²) — Quadratic time complexity. The time to execution it is proportional to the square of the input size n. (example, a loop within a loop).\n\nOur brute force solution to the problem above is a Quadratic solution (or pretty close to it). An example of Quadratic time complexity would be looping through all the elements of the array and then looping through all the elements again within the loop, thus squaring the amount of time it takes for the algorithm to run (our brute force solution example is slightly better since it’s only looping through the remaining elements, but it still really slow).\n\nWhen we revisit the problem, we understand that solution will have to iterate through the array (at least once), so the runtime will need to be dependent on the size of the array, but we want to aim for a linear solution.\n\nSo let’s refactor our solution by using an object (it’s faster to use key lookups than iterating through an array).\n\nThe solution above is linear because we only loop through the array one time.\n\nAs we loop through the movies array, we check for the remainder in the object. Ultimately, we are searching for the remainder in the previous elements. If there isn’t a match, we add the current element to the object and continue looping through the array.\n\nI hope this solution will help you rethink your nested loop solutions."

        "document": "We have discussed Asymptotic Analysis, Worst, Average and Best Cases and Asymptotic Notations in previous posts. In this post, an analysis of iterative programs with simple examples is discussed.\n\nThe analysis of loops for the complexity analysis of algorithms involves finding the number of operations performed by a loop as a function of the input size. This is usually done by determining the number of iterations of the loop and the number of operations performed in each iteration.\n\nHere are the general steps to analyze loops for complexity analysis:\n\nDetermine the number of iterations of the loop. This is usually done by analyzing the loop control variables and the loop termination condition.\n\nDetermine the number of operations performed in each iteration of the loop. This can include both arithmetic operations and data access operations, such as array accesses or memory accesses.\n\nExpress the total number of operations performed by the loop as a function of the input size. This may involve using mathematical expressions or finding a closed-form expression for the number of operations performed by the loop.\n\nDetermine the order of growth of the expression for the number of operations performed by the loop. This can be done by using techniques such as big O notation or by finding the dominant term and ignoring lower-order terms.\n\nThe time complexity of a function (or set of statements) is considered as O(1) if it doesn’t contain a loop, recursion, and call to any other non-constant time function. \n\n i.e. set of non-recursive and non-loop statements\n\nIn computer science, O(1) refers to constant time complexity, which means that the running time of an algorithm remains constant and does not depend on the size of the input. This means that the execution time of an O(1) algorithm will always take the same amount of time regardless of the input size. An example of an O(1) algorithm is accessing an element in an array using an index.\n• None A loop or recursion that runs a constant number of times is also considered O(1). For example, the following loop is O(1).\n\nThe Time Complexity of a loop is considered as O(n) if the loop variables are incremented/decremented by a constant amount. For example following functions have O(n) time complexity. Linear time complexity, denoted as O(n), is a measure of the growth of the running time of an algorithm proportional to the size of the input. In an O(n) algorithm, the running time increases linearly with the size of the input. For example, searching for an element in an unsorted array or iterating through an array and performing a constant amount of work for each element would be O(n) operations. In simple words, for an input of size n, the algorithm takes n steps to complete the operation.\n\nThe time complexity is defined as an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the squared size of the input data, as in nested loops it is equal to the number of times the innermost statement is executed. For example, the following sample loops have O(n2) time complexity\n\nQuadratic time complexity, denoted as O(n^2), refers to an algorithm whose running time increases proportional to the square of the size of the input. In other words, for an input of size n, the algorithm takes n * n steps to complete the operation. An example of an O(n^2) algorithm is a nested loop that iterates over the entire input for each element, performing a constant amount of work for each iteration. This results in a total of n * n iterations, making the running time quadratic in the size of the input.\n\nExample: Selection sort and Insertion Sort have O(n2) time complexity.\n\nThe time Complexity of a loop is considered as O(Logn) if the loop variables are divided/multiplied by a constant amount. And also for recursive calls in the recursive function, the Time Complexity is considered as O(Logn).\n\nThe Time Complexity of a loop is considered as O(LogLogn) if the loop variables are reduced/increased exponentially by a constant amount.\n\nSee this for mathematical details.\n\nHow to combine the time complexities of consecutive loops?\n\nWhen there are consecutive loops, we calculate time complexity as a sum of the time complexities of individual loops.\n\nTo combine the time complexities of consecutive loops, you need to consider the number of iterations performed by each loop and the amount of work performed in each iteration. The total time complexity of the algorithm can be calculated by multiplying the number of iterations of each loop by the time complexity of each iteration and taking the maximum of all possible combinations.\n\nFor example, consider the following code:\n\nHere, the outer loop performs n iterations, and the inner loop performs m iterations for each iteration of the outer loop. So, the total number of iterations performed by the inner loop is n * m, and the total time complexity is O(n * m).\n\nIn another example, consider the following code:\n\nHere, the outer loop performs n iterations, and the inner loop performs i iterations for each iteration of the outer loop, where i is the current iteration count of the outer loop. The total number of iterations performed by the inner loop can be calculated by summing the number of iterations performed in each iteration of the outer loop, which is given by the formula sum(i) from i=1 to n, which is equal to n * (n + 1) / 2. Hence, the total time complex\n\n\n\nHow to calculate time complexity when there are many if, else statements inside loops?\n\nAs discussed here, the worst-case time complexity is the most useful among best, average and worst. Therefore we need to consider the worst case. We evaluate the situation when values in if-else conditions cause a maximum number of statements to be executed. \n\nFor example, consider the linear search function where we consider the case when an element is present at the end or not present at all. \n\nWhen the code is too complex to consider all if-else cases, we can get an upper bound by ignoring if-else and other complex control statements.\n\nHow to calculate the time complexity of recursive functions?\n\nThe time complexity of a recursive function can be written as a mathematical recurrence relation. To calculate time complexity, we must know how to solve recurrences. We will soon be discussing recurrence-solving techniques as a separate post.\n\nQuiz on Analysis of Algorithms \n\nFor more details, please refer: Design and Analysis of Algorithms.\n\nPlease write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above."
