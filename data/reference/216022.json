We can pass the iterators to the start and end of the second map and this function will insert all the elements of the second map to the first map without duplication.\n\nC++ Program to Concatenate Two Maps\n\nThe below example demonstrates how we can concatenate two maps using the std::insert() function in C++.\n\nTime Complexity: O(M logN), here N is the number of elements in the first map and M is the elements in the second map.\n\nAuxiliary Space: O(M)"

By default, it stores data in ascending order of the keys, but this can be changes as per requirement.\n\nExplanation: In the above program, we created a map m of integer keys and string values. We inserted three key-value pairs into the map: {1, “Geeks”}, {2, “For”}, and {3, “Geeks”}. The map automatically sorts the keys in ascending order.\n\nThe map container is defined as std::map class template inside the <map> header file.\n• comp: Custom comparator function that defines how to compare two keys for sorting. It is optional and if not provided, sorts data in increasing order of the keys.\n\nWe can declare and initialize a map in different ways as shown in the below example:\n\nExample: In the above program,\n• map<int, string> m1 is an empty map with no elements.\n• map<int, string> m2 = {{1, “Geeks”}, {2, “For”}, {3, “Geeks”}} initialized to three key-value pairs using initializer list.\n\nTo see more ways to declare and initialize map, refer to this article – Different Ways to Initialize a Map\n\nBasic operations on map containers are shown below:\n\nElements can be inserted into a map using either [] operator or insert() method. If the element with the given key already exists, the insert() method skips the insertion but [] operator updates the associated value to the new value.\n\nWe cannot specify any particular position to insert element as map automatically sort the data according to the order. To know more ways to insert elements in a map, refer this article – Different Ways to Insert Elements in a Map\n\nMap elements can be accessed by using the corresponding key inside operator []. If the key exists, it will return the associated value but if the key doesn’t exist, it will create a new element with the given key and the default value. To avoid this, we can also use at() method for accessing elements with any modification.\n\nTo know more methods to access values in a map, refer to the article – Different Ways to Access a Value in a Map\n\nThe key of an already present elements cannot be modified in the map. But the associated value can be changed by first accessing the element and then using assignment operator to change the value.\n\nExplanation: In this program, expression m[0] = “Tweaks” updates the value associated with the key 0. Similarly, expression m.at(1) = “By” updates the value of the key 1.\n\nTo see more methods to update values in a map, refer to the article – Different Ways to Update Value of a Pair in Map\n\nMap provides fast element search by key using the find() member function. This function returns iterator the element if found, otherwise returns end() iterator.\n\nTo know more methods to search element in map, refer to this article – Check if Map Contains a Specific Key\n\nMaps can be easily traversed by using either range based for loop or using begin() and end() iterator with traditional loops.\n\nTo see more methods to traverse a map, refer to the article – Different Ways to Traverse a Map\n\nMap elements can be deleted from a map using erase() method by passing the key or an iterator.\n\nTo know more ways to delete elements in a map, refer this article – Different Ways to Delete Elements from Map\n\nThe below table lists the time complexity of the above operations on map:\n\nFollowing are some other commonly used operations on a map in C++:\n\nIn C++, map is an associative container that provides the built-in implementation of Red-Black Tree. It stores the elements in some sorted order on the basis of keys. Due do RB Trees, insertion, deletion, and search operations takes logarithmic O(log n) time.\n\nHere’s the list of all member functions of std::map:\n\nInsert elements with a particular key in the map container. Returns an iterator of pairs. The pair refers to the bounds of a range that includes all the elements in the container which have a key equivalent to k. Used to erase elements from the map. Returns an iterator pointing to the first element of the map. Returns an iterator pointing to the first element of the map. Returns a reverse iterator pointing to the element preceding the first element of the map Returns a reverse iterator pointing to the last element of the map. Returns an iterator to the element with key-value in the map if found, else returns the iterator to end. crbegin() returns a constant reverse iterator referring to the last element in the map container. crend() returns a constant reverse iterator pointing to the theoretical element before the first element in the map. cbegin() returns a constant iterator referring to the first element in the map container. cend() returns a constant iterator pointing to the element that is beyond the last element. Inserts the key with value in the map container. Returns the maximum number of elements a map can hold. Find the first element in the map that is just greater than the given key. Find the first element in the map that is equal to or greater than the given key. Inserts the key and its element in the map container with a given hint. Returns the object that determines how the elements in the map are ordered (‘<‘ by default). Returns the object that determines how the elements in the map are ordered (‘<‘ by default). Returns the number of elements in the map. Returns whether the map is empty. Removes all the elements from the map. at() function is used to the element associated with the key k. swap() function is used to exchange the contents of two maps but the maps must be of the same type, although sizes may differ."

First, you can use with list initialization syntax:\n\nThis is functionally equivalent to\n\nbut much more concise and readable.

        "document": "In the world of programming, efficient data storage and retrieval are crucial for many applications. One powerful tool in C++ that helps achieve this is the std::map container. std::map is a part of the Standard Template Library (STL) and provides an associative array that stores key-value pairs. In this blog, we will explore the features of std::map and provide a code example to demonstrate its usage.\n\nstd::map is implemented as a binary search tree, which ensures that the elements are always sorted based on their keys. This sorted structure allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of elements, making std::map a popular choice when fast key-based operations are required.\n• Ordered Storage: As mentioned earlier, std::map arranges its elements based on their keys. This ordering enables easy traversal of the elements in either ascending or descending order.\n• Unique Keys: Each key in a std::map is unique. This property ensures that you cannot have multiple elements with the same key. If an attempt is made to insert a duplicate key, the insertion operation will fail.\n• Associative Lookup: std::map allows for efficient associative lookup. Given a key, you can quickly find the corresponding value associated with it. This feature is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to perform frequent searches based on specific keys.\n• Dynamic Size: std::map can dynamically grow and shrink as elements are inserted or removed. It takes care of memory management, making it convenient to work with varying data sizes.\n• Efficient Operations: std::map provides efficient operations like insertion, deletion, and searching, with a time complexity of O (log n).\n\nLet’s dive into a simple code example to demonstrate the usage of std::map:\n\nIn this example, we create a std::map called to store student names with corresponding integer keys. We insert three key-value pairs using the function. We then access and update elements using the keys. The ‌function is used to check if a particular key exists. We iterate over the map using a range-based for loop and print the values. Finally, we remove an element using and check the size of the map using the function.\n\nIn this example, we create a std::map named with the key as a string and the value as an integer. We then insert three key-value pairs into the map using the subscript operator ( ). The keys are the names of the students, and the values represent their marks.\n\nWe access the value associated with the key “Bob” using the subscript operator, and modify the value associated with the key “Charlie” using the same operator. We also demonstrate how to check if a key exists in the map using the function.\n\nFinally, we iterate over the map using a range-based for loop and print all the key-value pairs.\n\nstd::map is a versatile container in C++ that simplifies data storage and retrieval based on keys. Its ordered storage, associative lookup, and dynamic size make it a powerful tool for various applications. With its well-defined functionality and ease of use, std::map is worth considering whenever you need efficient key-based operations in your C++ programs."

So, if you have a without default constructor then you have to use for updation but for first time inserts you have to use or because first creates the object using default constructor and then returns a reference to it.\n\nThat can be justified by some reasons best known to STL designers but I am here to rant about a different issue which is making me pull my hairs. Let's say you have a simple class\n• has the signature and you can not call it like , you have to call it like\n• But you can call like .\n• You can neither call as nor as .
