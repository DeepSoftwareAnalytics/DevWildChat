        "document": "C++ Program to Find the Frequency of Characters in a String\n\nIn C++, analyzing the frequency of characters in a string is a common task that tests your understanding of string manipulation and data storage techniques. This exercise can help in a variety of applications such as data analysis, cryptography, and text processing systems where understanding the distribution of characters can be crucial.\n\nIn this article, you will learn how to create efficient programs in C++ to find the frequency of characters in a string. The discussion will include a straightforward method using an array as well as a more dynamic approach using the Standard Template Library (STL). You'll also get to see practical examples that you can run and modify to suit specific needs.\n\nThis section demonstrates how to employ arrays in C++ to determine the frequency of each character in a string. The assumption here is that the string contains only ASCII characters.\n• None Initialize an array to store the frequency count of each character.\n• None Iterate over the string and increment the array values based on character ASCII values.\n• An array of size 256 is initialized to zero. Each index represents the ASCII value of a character.\n• The loop through the string increments the frequency of each character.\n• A second loop prints out the frequency of characters that appear in the string.\n\nUsing the array index as the ASCII value simplifies the character frequency analysis. The approach is efficient but primarily useful for ASCII characters only.\n\nFor strings that include non-ASCII characters or when you prefer a more adaptable approach, using the STL map is recommended.\n• None Include the necessary headers and declare the for character counting.\n• None Loop over the string, increasing the map's value for each character.\n• is used for counting where each character is a key and its frequency is the value.\n• Elements in the map are automatically initialized to zero.\n• A loop iterates through each character in the string, incrementing the corresponding value in the map.\n• Another loop goes through the map to print each character and its frequency.\n\nMaps are particularly useful for counting when characters are Unicode or the dataset is large with a lot of distinct characters, as maps only store entries for characters that actually appear in the string.\n\nThe ability to count the frequency of characters in a string is a valuable skill in C++. This discussion provides two approaches—using an array and using a map. The array method is excellent for simple, ASCII-based strings and is faster due to direct access via ASCII values. The map approach, while slightly slower, offers flexibility and is ideal for handling a wider variety of characters or when the input size and diversity are significantly large. Choose the method that best fits the use scenario and requirements of your project to keep your programs efficient and effective."

        "document": "In C++, unordered_map is an unordered associative container that stores data in the form of unique key-value pairs. But unlike map, unordered map stores its elements using hashing. This provides average constant-time complexity O(1) for search, insert, and delete operations but the elements are not sorted in any particular order.\n\nExplanation: In this example, we created an unordered map um with three key-value pairs: {1, “Geeks”}, {2, “For”} and {3, “C++”}.\n\nUnordered map is defined as the std::unordered_map class template inside the <unordered_map> header file.\n\nWe can declare and initialize unordered map in different ways as shown:\n\nExplanation: In this example,\n• unordered_map<int, string> um1 creates an empty unordered map. This is called default initialization.\n• unordered_map<int, string> um2 = {{1, “Geeks”}, {2, “For”}, {3, “C++”}} initializes the unordered map using an initializer list.\n\nThe basic operations on unordered map are shown below:\n\nA new key-value pairs can be inserted in unordered map using either [] operator or insert() method. If the element with the given key already exists, the insert() method skip the insertion but [] operator updates the associated value to the new value.\n\nElements in unordered map can be accessed using the [] operator or at() function. But if the key is not found, [] operator insert default value for key then return that default value. So, it is better to use at() method.\n\nIn unordered map, elements can be updated by simply assigning a new value while accessing using assignment operator. But again with [] operator, a new element will be created if the key is not present.\n\nExplanation: In this example, the [] operator updates the value of key 2 to “By“, while the at() function updates the value of key 1 to “Tips“.\n\nUnordered map provides fast element search by key using the find() member function. This function returns iterator the element if found, otherwise returns end() iterator.\n\nTraversing an unordered map involves iterating through all the key-value pairs stored in the container. This can be done by incrementing begin() iterator till it is not equal to end() iterator.\n\nRange based for loop can also be used for simple traversal. Since unordered map does not maintain a specific order of elements, the order in which elements are traversed may not match the order in which they were inserted.\n\nElements in an unordered map can be deleted using the erase() function by passing a specific key or the iterator to the element.\n\nExplanation: In the above example, delete the pair that has the key 2 and also delete the first element pointed to by the iterator begin() using the erase() method.\n\nThe below table lists the time complexity of the above operations on unordered map:\n\nUnordered map is used in many situations for different purposes. The following examples’ aim is to help you master unordered map beyond the basics:\n\nIn C++, unordered map provides the built-in implementation of hash table data structure. It hashes only the key from each element to find its index in the table and stores the element as key value pair. As it uses hashing, insertion, deletion and search operations take O(1) amortized time.\n\nPrimary difference between unordered map and map is shown below:\n• None Unordered Map does not maintain any specific order of elements. The order of elements is determined by their hash values, and it may vary.\n• None Map stores elements in a sorted order based on the key. The elements are ordered according to a comparison function, typically in ascending order.\n\nFollowing is the list of all member functions of std::unordered_map class in C++:\n\nThis function in C++ unordered map returns the reference to the value with the element as key k. This operator is used to access or update the value of a specific key. This function is used to check if the container contains element with specific key. Return the bounds of a range that includes all the elements in the container with a key that compares equal to k Returns an iterator pointing to the first element in the container. Returns an iterator pointing to the position beyond the last element in the container. Return the constant iterator pointing to the first element in the container. Returns a constant iterator pointing to the position beyond the last element in the container. Returns the bucket number where the element with the key k is located in the unordered map. Bucket count is used to count the total no. of buckets in the unordered map. No parameter is required to pass into this function Returns the number of elements in each bucket of the unordered map. Return the maximum number which can hold by a bucket in the container. Count the number of elements present in an unordered map with a given key. Returns iterator to the element with specific key. Checks whether the unordered map is empty or not. Return the number of elements present inside the unordered map. Return the maximum number that which can hold by the unordered map. Delete all elements from the unordered map. This function is used to insert an element into unordered map. This function is used to insert range of elements into unordered map. This function is used to insert an element in the unordered map. This function is used to insert a key with his value with a given hint. This function is used to swap two unordered maps.

        "document": "The Standard Template Library (STL) is a collection of C++ container classes and template algorithms that work together to produce a variety of useful functionalities. The STL was designed to combine different data structures with different algorithms while achieving the best performance; this guarantees the interoperability between all built-in and user-built components. To benefit from the powerful framework and great performance of the STL, you must know the concepts and apply them carefully.\n\nThere are various solutions to a problem, but not all of them are the best. Generally, we tend to use the most efficient solution. In programming, we can't leave the mechanism of finding the best solution; we need a clear standard to evaluate their efficiency. This is where the notion of time complexity enter the equation.\n\nThe Big-O notation describes the runtime of an algorithm and defines the upper bound of any algorithm (i.e, algorithm should not take more than this time). Big-O notation is the most used notation for the time complexity of an algorithm for a given input of size . For example, if the runtime grows linearly with the number of elements , then the complexity is and if the runtime is independent of the input, the complexity is .\n\nThere are different types of time complexities used; the below table lists the typical values of complexity and their Big-O notation.\n\nIn the graph, the x axis represents the size of (or algorithm input) and y represents the amount of time it would take to execute that algorithm.\n\nLet’s run through an example to understand better: Finding the sum of the first n numbers.\n\nThere is only one statement in the preceding code, and we know that a statement takes a constant amount of time to execute. The basic idea is that if the statement takes constant time, it will take the same amount of time regardless of input size, which we denote as .\n\nIn this solution, we will run a loop from to and we will add these values to a variable named .\n\n\n\nThe big O notation of the above code is , where and are constants. So, the overall time complexity can be written as\n\nIn this solution, we will increment the value of variable times i.e. for , the sum variable will be incremented once i.e. . For , the sum variable will be incremented twice. So, let's see the solution.\n\n\n\nThe big O notation of the above algorithm is . Since we take the higher order of growth in big O. So, our expression will be reduced to .\n\nA container is an object that stores a collection of elements (i.e. other objects). Each of these containers manages the storage space for their elements and provides access to each element through iterators or member functions. The container library provides standardized interface for member functions; these standardized interface allow containers to be used with STL algorithms.\n\nThe C++ containers library categorized as\n• Sequence containers - ordered collections in which every element has a certain position.\n• Associative containers - sorted collections in which the position of an element depends on its key due to a certain sorting criterion\n• Unordered associative containers - unordered collections in which the position of an element doesn’t matter.\n\nIn sequence containers, the position of an element depends on the time and place of the insertion, but it is independent of the value of the element. For example, if you put 5 elements into the a container by appending each element at the end of the actual collection, these elements are in the exact order in which you put them (Hence the name Sequence Containers). The STL contains three predefined sequence container classes: , , and .\n\nThe comes into play when array-like storage is needed, but with varying sizes. It uses memory from the heap to store objects and hence is a dynamic array. It enables random access, which means you can access each element directly with the corresponding index. Sequence containers are usually implemented as arrays or linked lists\n• Appending and removing elements at the end of the array is very fast using and respectively ( in complexity notation).\n• However, inserting an element in the middle or at the beginning of the array takes time because all the following elements have to be moved to make room for it while maintaining the order ( in complexity notation for vector elements).\n• Vector reallocation occurs when vector size increases beyond its current storage capacity, it will automatically move all items to a larger chunk of newly allocated memory and delete the old chunk.\n• In such cases. iterators or references that point at altered portions of the sequence become invalid.\n\nSize and capacity of the container\n\nis a the number of elements up to the highest-indexed one you have used; whereas is the number of elements the vector can hold before reallocating.\n\nThe following example defines a vector for integer values, inserts six elements, and prints the elements of the vector:\n\n\n\nDeque is an abbreviation for double ended queue. it is a dynamic array that is implemented so that it can grow in both directions.\n• Inserting elements at the end and at the beginning is fast ( in complexity notation).\n• However, inserting elements in the middle takes time because elements must be moved ( in complexity notation for deque elements).\n• If an element is inserted into an empty sequence, or if an element is erased to leave an empty sequence, then iterators earlier returned by and become invalid.\n• None If an element is inserted at the first position of the deque, then all iterators that designate existing elements become invalid.\n• None If an element is inserted at the end of the deque, then and all iterators that designate existing elements become invalid.\n• None Allocating contents from the center of the underlying array, and resizing the underlying array when either end is reached leads to frequent resizing and waste more space, particularly when elements are only inserted at one end.\n\nIt is important to note that, allocator allocates block of memory in a single allocation and hence frequent or has less memory allocation overhead compared to vector. In vector the memory is allocated in smaller chunks, hence frequent insertion of elements leads to frequent allocation of memory, slowing down the container.\n\nThe following general example declares a for floating-point values:\n\n\n\nA is implemented as a doubly linked list of elements. This means each element in a list has its own segment of memory and refers to its predecessor and its successor.\n• Unlike s and s, fast random access to elements is not supported, to access the tenth element, you must navigate the first nine elements by following the chain of their links ( complexity because the average distance is proportional to the number of elements).\n• supports bidirectional iterators and allows constant time and operations anywhere within the sequence, with storage management handled automatically. ( complexity).\n• If only uni-directional list traversal is needed, may be more performant in both space and maintenance complexity, because it maintains only list item pointers in one direction.\n\nAssociative container can be considered a special kind of sequence container because sorted collections are ordered according to a sorting criterion. The automatic sorting of elements in associative containers does not mean that those containers are especially designed for sorting elements. The key advantage of automatic sorting is better performance when you search elements. In particular, you can always use a binary search, which results in logarithmic complexity rather than linear complexity.\n\nAn associative container is a variable-sized container that supports efficient retrieval of elements (values) based on keys. It supports insertion and removal of elements, but differs from a sequence in that it does not provide a mechanism for inserting an element at a specific position. The STL contains four predefined associative container classes: , , , .\n\nA set is a collection in which elements are sorted according to their own values. Each element may occur only once, thus duplicates are not allowed.\n• and can be used with .\n\nA multiset is the same as a set except that duplicates are allowed. Thus, a multiset may contain multiple elements that have the same value.\n• The time complexity of is additionally linear ( ) to the number of elements having the key.\n\nA map contains elements that are key/value pairs. Each element has a key that is the basis for the sorting criterion and a value. Each key may occur only once, thus duplicate keys are not allowed. A map can also be used as an associative array, which is an array that has an arbitrary index type.\n• Since could be slow, we can use map to store the frequency of a key instead of inserting multiple copies of they same key into a multiset .\n• Insertion, deletion and lookup has logarithmic complexity , when is the number of entries.\n• If the index operator is called with a non-existing number, it stores this number in the map and uses the default constructor for generating the data. This ensures that the index operator never returns an invalid reference.\n• In order to prevent above case, should be called beforehand.\n\ndiffers from in the same way as differs from : multiple entries of elements with identical keys are possible.\n\nContainer have a predefined comparison function, Sometimes we may want to supply alternative comparison function. The complete declaration for is\n• is the type of elements that will be held\n• is the memory allocator, with the default being\n• Compare is the type of the comparison used, with the default being\n\nwe can provide our desired comparison function object for the template parameter.\n\n\n\nBinary search tree is not the only way of implementing associative containers. With hash tables, items can be found in time. The of the hash table can be manipulated by the user, and the hash function can also be chosen individually, which is important, because the performance versus space consumption characteristics depend on that.\n• Since elements are unordered, you cannot perform binary search\n• Also, does not return the smallest element\n• In order to use , classes must have hash function implemented\n\nAlternatively, you can implement a stronger hash function that produces different, unpredictable hashes for the same number across runs.\n\nContainer adapters are a special type of container class. They are not full container classes on their own, but wrappers around other container types (such as a vector, deque, or list). These container adapters encapsulate the underlying container type and limit the user interfaces accordingly.\n• There are three standard container adapters: stacks, queues, and priority queues.\n• Constructor adapters allow you to pass a specific allocator to their constructors.\n• Container adapters provide the feature, which internally creates a new element initialized by the passed arguments\n\nA is a container which allows insertion, retrieving, and deletion only at one end (LIFO data structure). Objects inserted first are removed last. Any one of the sequence container could be used as a , if those containers supports the following operation.\n• Insertion at one end (push, with ).\n• Deletion from the same end (pop, with ).\n• Retrieving the value at that end (top, with ).\n• Testing the being empty (with ).\n\nThe is a of with a default implementation using a .\n\nA queue allows you to insert objects at one end and to remove them from the opposite end (FIFO data structure). The objects at both ends of the queue can be read without being removed.\n• and are suitable data types for implementation.\n• The is a of with a default implementation using a .\n• removes the elements in the same order in which they are inserted.\n• returns the first element in the queue.\n• returns the last element in the queue.\n\nA priority queue always returns the element with the highest priority. The priority criterion must be specified when creating the queue. In the simplest case, it is the greatest (or smallest) number in the queue. We can also write our own custom compare to describe the priority of an element in the queue (default compare is ).\n• None Do you need to be able to insert a new element at an arbitrary position in the container? - if so, you need a sequence containers.\n• None Do you care how elements are ordered in the container? - if not, hashed containers becomes workable choice, otherwise use ordered containers.\n• None Do you need to avoid movement of existing containers elements when insertions and erasures take place? - Avoid using contiguous containers\n• None Does you code has frequent ? - use instead of as allocates block of data.\n• None If there are strict requirements on memory usage, additional memory overhead for storing hash table cannot be accepted.\n• None If you are to traverse the map use ordered map instead of unordered map.\n• None If the size is immutable choose instead of .\n• None If there are frequent insertion and remove of the elements in the middle of the sequence- use instead of vector and deque.\n\nIn some use cases the containers in STL are not a great fit, in that case we can write our own containers. With the implementation of some basic core interfaces we can use adaptor interface efficiently."

We hope this tutorial has been useful to you. Comment below if you have any questions."

The default C locale classifies these characters as punctuation:\n\nApproach: First check the input string if it consists of punctuations then we have to make it punctuation free. In order to do this, we will traverse over the string, and if punctuations are found we will remove them. Let’s say the input string is ‘ Student ‘ then we have to remove $ and @, furthermore we have to print the plain string ‘Student‘ which is free from any punctuations.\n\nBelow is the implementation of the above approach:\n\nApproach 2 : – Using a loop to iterate over the string and remove punctuations\n\nInitialize an empty string called result.\n\n Iterate over the characters in the given string using a loop.\n\n For each character, check if it is a punctuation character using the ispunct function.\n\n If the character is not a punctuation character, add it to the result string.\n\n Repeat steps 3-4 for all characters in the string.\n\n Replace the original string with the result string, effectively removing all punctuation characters from the original string.\n\nThis approach may be useful in cases where you need to perform additional operations on each character in the string before removing punctuations, or if you need to process the string character-by-character rather than using a built-in algorithm.\n\nTime Complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the string\n\nAuxiliary Space: O(1)"

        "document": "File handling is used to store data permanently in a computer. Using file handling we can store our data in secondary memory (Hard disk).\n\nHow to achieve the File Handling\n\nFor achieving file handling we need to follow the following steps:-\n\n STEP 1-Naming a file\n\n STEP 2-Opening a file\n\n STEP 3-Writing data into the file\n\n STEP 4-Reading data from the file\n\n STEP 5-Closing a file.\n\nWe give input to the executing program and the execution program gives back the output. The sequence of bytes given as input to the executing program and the sequence of bytes that comes as output from the executing program are called stream. In other words, streams are nothing but the flow of data in a sequence.\n\nThe input and output operation between the executing program and the devices like keyboard and monitor are known as “console I/O operation”. The input and output operation between the executing program and files are known as “disk I/O operation”.\n\nThe I/O system of C++ contains a set of classes which define the file handling methods. These include ifstream, ofstream and fstream classes. These classes are derived from fstream and from the corresponding iostream class. These classes, designed to manage the disk files, are declared in fstream and therefore we must include this file in any program that uses files. File handling is essential for data storage and retrieval in applications.\n• None This class is the base class for other classes in this class hierarchy.\n• None This class contains the necessary facilities that are used by all the other derived classes for input and output operations.\n• None This class is derived from the class ‘ios’.\n• None The extraction operator(>>) is overloaded in this class to handle input streams from files to the program execution.\n• None This class declares input functions such as get(), getline() and read().\n• None This class is derived from the class ‘ios’.\n• None The insertion operator(<<) is overloaded in this class to handle output streams to files from the program execution.\n• None This class declares output functions such as put() and write().\n• None This class contains a pointer which points to the buffer which is used to manage the input and output streams.\n• None This class provides operations common to the file streams. Serves as a base for fstream, ifstream and ofstream class.\n• None This class contains open() and close() function.\n• None It contains open() function with default input mode.\n• None Inherits the functions get(), getline(), read(), seekg() and tellg() functions from the istream.\n• None It contains open() function with default output mode.\n• None Inherits the functions put(), write(), seekp() and tellp() functions from the ostream.\n• None This class provides support for simultaneous input and output operations.\n• None Inherits all the functions from istream and ostream classes through iostream.\n• None Its purpose is to set the file buffers to read and write.\n• None We can also use file buffer member function to determine the length of the file. \n\n\n\nIn C++, files are mainly dealt by using three classes fstream, ifstream, ofstream available in fstream headerfile. \n\nofstream: Stream class to write on files \n\nifstream: Stream class to read from files \n\nfstream: Stream class to both read and write from/to files.\n\nNow the first step to open the particular file for read or write operation. We can open file by \n\n1. passing file name in constructor at the time of object creation \n\n2. using the open method\n\nBoth ios::app and ios::ate take us to the end of the file when it is opened. The difference between the two modes is that ios :: app allow us to add data to the end of the file only, while ios :: ate mode permits us add data or to modify the existing data anywhere in the file.\n\nProblem Statement : To read and write a File in C++. \n\nExamples:\n\nBelow is the implementation by using ifstream & ofstream classes.\n\nBelow is the implementation by using fstream class."

        "document": "I've been exploring file IO a bit more, particularly reading files into an application, and as with many things in C++ I'm finding that there are many ways to do the same thing. With this post I am not asking \"what is the best way to load a file in C++\". I'm willing to bet the answer to this question is \"it depends\" (although if I'm wrong I'd love to know). Instead I'm hoping to get some clarity on different methods and options so that I can make a well-informed decision on the best way to handling reading a file for a given circumstance. Specifically, I am interested in both what the recommendations are, and (if different) what the actual common way of doing things are, and why they might be different.\n\nMy first area of questions concerns the three common methods I see in examples for how to read a file. In this example I am simply trying to read the contents of a file into a string. I am making the assumption that the entire file can reasonably fit in a single buffer. I have broadly seen three ideas thrown around, which I will show in examples below. For the sake of readability, assume the following snippet proceeds each of the example snippets (I have omitted error checks for brevity).\n\nThis idea of fetching each line and appending it to some buffer is the most common one I see, but I'm not entirely sure why. I would have thought that I would be more efficient to load the entire file (or chunk of a file) in a single call (as in option 2). I can see this option being useful if you need to process each line before appending it to the string, but beyond that I don't see why this is so common. Also I'm not sure why but I almost never see anyone 'reserve' the memory before filling it with this method. I could be wrong but my understanding is that without reserving you would get multiple memory reallocations as the underlying array is resized to fit the new data. Is this correct?\n\nThis is what I thought would be the most recommended way of doing things, but I haven't seen it as much. If I understand things correctly I this should just copy the entire file contents into the string in one go, which I would imagine would be more efficient than multiple calls.\n\nEven simpler than the previous two, I see this one a bit more, i'm guessing because of the simplicity of it. Would this be as performant as the other two options though? I haven't really wrapped my head around how works under the hood, so I'm not sure what the efficiency of this would look like.\n\nOf these three methods, where would be the best scenarios to use each? Is there any meaningful performance difference between each? Are there philosophical reasons why an option would be preferred or avoided?\n\nThrough my readings I have seen conflicting claims about C++ IO-streams vs C File IO functions. The most common one is performance. One side claims that streams are significantly slower, and the other says that streams are just as fast if not faster than C File IO. (I have some a little evidence that supports the first position but not enough to be confident).\n\nMy questions about Streams vs C-Style File IO are:\n• Are C++ streams actually that much slower than C File IO?\n• If they are, are the features they have like RAII and exception support worth the speed decrease?\n• What is more common to see in real codebases?\n\nFor the first question, if anyone can provide benchmarks that would be amazing. I've found some but not many so it be great to see some more testing results.\n\nShould we be disabling sync_with_stdio?\n\nThis final question is pretty self explanatory. The reason I ask is because I've seen claims that setting sync_with_stdio significantly improves the performance, but I haven't found much evidence that proves this either way. I also don't see the suggestion very often so I'm wondering if there is a reason for that. Is disabling sync_with_stdio something that is generally recommended in practice? If not, why?"

        "document": "First of all, for the block to do any good, you need to enable exceptions for the stream.\n\nWill lead to nothing but trouble, and you're seeing that here. The problem (in this case) is that when the file failed to open, will never be signaled -- you can't/don't reach the end of the file because there is no file. Therefore, your loop runs forever, on an existentialist search for the end of a nonexistent file. Fix the loop, and things get better in a hurry:\n\nWhile you're at it, a bit more fixing wouldn't hurt (unless you really meant to use less than half of the space you allocated for your buffer):\n\nOr, of course, eliminate the problem entirely:\n\nEdit: note that none of these (at least currently) depends on exceptions at all. They're all set up to write a line to the output if we succeeded in our attempt at reading a line from the input. If the file didn't open, the body of the loop simply won't execute, because we won't be able to read from a file that didn't open. If we want to print an error message telling the user that the file didn't open, we'd have to handle that separately from what's above. For example:"
