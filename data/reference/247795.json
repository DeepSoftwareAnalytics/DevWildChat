This option only modifies the behavior when an existing session was loaded for the request.\n\nForces a session that is “uninitialized” to be saved to the store. A session is uninitialized when it is new but not modified. Choosing is useful for implementing login sessions, reducing server storage usage, or complying with laws that require permission before setting a cookie. Choosing will also help with race conditions where a client makes multiple parallel requests without a session.\n\nThe default value is , but using the default has been deprecated, as the default will change in the future. Please research into this setting and choose what is appropriate to your use-case.\n\nNote if you are using Session in conjunction with PassportJS, Passport will add an empty Passport object to the session for use after a user is authenticated, which will be treated as a modification to the session, causing it to be saved. This has been fixed in PassportJS 0.3.0\n\nThis is the secret used to sign the session ID cookie. The secret can be any type of value that is supported by Node.js (like a string or a ). This can be either a single secret, or an array of multiple secrets. If an array of secrets is provided, only the first element will be used to sign the session ID cookie, while all the elements will be considered when verifying the signature in requests. The secret itself should be not easily parsed by a human and would best be a random set of characters. A best practice may include:\n• The use of environment variables to store the secret, ensuring the secret itself does not exist in your repository.\n• Periodic updates of the secret, while ensuring the previous secret is in the array.\n\nUsing a secret that cannot be guessed will reduce the ability to hijack a session to only guessing the session ID (as determined by the option).\n\nChanging the secret value will invalidate all existing sessions. In order to rotate the secret without invalidating sessions, provide an array of secrets, with the new secret as first element of the array, and including previous secrets as the later elements.\n\nNote HMAC-256 is used to sign the session ID. For this reason, the secret should contain at least 32 bytes of entropy.\n\nThe session store instance, defaults to a new instance.\n\nControl the result of unsetting (through , setting to , etc.).\n\nThe default value is .\n• The session will be destroyed (deleted) when the response ends.\n• The session in the store will be kept, but modifications made during the request are ignored and not saved.\n\nTo store or access session data, simply use the request property , which is (generally) serialized as JSON by the store, so nested objects are typically fine. For example below is a user-specific view counter:\n\nTo regenerate the session simply invoke the method. Once complete, a new SID and instance will be initialized at and the will be invoked.\n\nDestroys the session and will unset the property. Once complete, the will be invoked.\n\nReloads the session data from the store and re-populates the object. Once complete, the will be invoked.\n\nSave the session back to the store, replacing the contents on the store with the contents in memory (though a store may do something else–consult the store’s documentation for exact behavior).\n\nThis method is automatically called at the end of the HTTP response if the session data has been altered (though this behavior can be altered with various options in the middleware constructor). Because of this, typically this method does not need to be called.\n\nThere are some cases where it is useful to call this method, for example, redirects, long-lived requests or in WebSockets.\n\nUpdates the property. Typically this is not necessary to call, as the session middleware does this for you.\n\nEach session has a unique ID associated with it. This property is an alias of and cannot be modified. It has been added to make the session ID accessible from the object.\n\nEach session has a unique cookie object accompany it. This allows you to alter the session cookie per visitor. For example we can set to to enable the cookie to remain for only the duration of the user-agent.\n\nAlternatively will return the time remaining in milliseconds, which we may also re-assign a new value to adjust the property appropriately. The following are essentially equivalent\n\nFor example when is set to (one minute), and 30 seconds has elapsed it will return until the current request has completed, at which time is called to reset to its original value.\n\nThe property returns the original (time-to-live), in milliseconds, of the session cookie.\n\nTo get the ID of the loaded session, access the request property . This is simply a read-only value set when a session is loaded/created.\n\nEvery session store must be an and implement specific methods. The following methods are the list of required, recommended, and optional.\n• Required methods are ones that this module will always call on the store.\n• Recommended methods are ones that this module will call on the store if available.\n• Optional methods are ones this module does not call at all, but helps present uniform stores to users.\n\nFor an example implementation view the connect-redis repo.\n\nThis optional method is used to get all sessions in the store as an array. The should be called as .\n\nThis required method is used to destroy/delete a session from the store given a session ID ( ). The should be called as once the session is destroyed.\n\nThis optional method is used to delete all sessions from the store. The should be called as once the store is cleared.\n\nThis optional method is used to get the count of all sessions in the store. The should be called as .\n\nThis required method is used to get a session from the store given a session ID ( ). The should be called as .\n\nThe argument should be a session if found, otherwise or if the session was not found (and there was no error). A special case is made when to act like .\n\nThis required method is used to upsert a session into the store given a session ID ( ) and session ( ) object. The callback should be called as once the session has been set in the store.\n\nThis recommended method is used to “touch” a given session given a session ID ( ) and session ( ) object. The should be called as once the session has been touched.\n\nThis is primarily used when the store will automatically delete idle sessions and this method is used to signal to the store the given session is active, potentially resetting the idle timer.\n\nThe following modules implement a session store that is compatible with this module. Please make a PR to add additional modules :)\n\ncluster-store A wrapper for using in-process / embedded stores - such as SQLite (via knex), leveldb, files, or memory - with node cluster (desirable for Raspberry Pi 2 and other multi-core embedded devices).\n\nconnect-memjs A memcached-based session store using memjs as the memcached client.\n\nconnect-session-knex A session store using Knex.js, which is a SQL query builder for PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite3, and Oracle.\n\nconnect-session-sequelize A session store using Sequelize.js, which is a Node.js / io.js ORM for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite and MSSQL.\n\ndynamodb-store-v3 Implementation of a session store using DynamoDB backed by the AWS SDK for JavaScript v3.\n\nexpress-mysql-session A session store using native MySQL via the node-mysql module.\n\nexpress-oracle-session A session store using native oracle via the node-oracledb module.\n\nexpress-session-cache-manager A store that implements cache-manager, which supports a variety of storage types.\n\nexpress-session-rsdb Session store based on Rocket-Store: A very simple, super fast and yet powerfull, flat file database.\n\nnedb-session-store An alternate NeDB-based (either in-memory or file-persisted) session store.\n\nsession-pouchdb-store Session store for PouchDB / CouchDB.

        "document": "Express is a routing and middleware web framework that has minimal functionality of its own: An Express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls.\n\nMiddleware functions are functions that have access to the request object ( ), the response object ( ), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named .\n\nMiddleware functions can perform the following tasks:\n• Make changes to the request and the response objects.\n• Call the next middleware function in the stack.\n\nIf the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.\n\nAn Express application can use the following types of middleware:\n\nYou can load application-level and router-level middleware with an optional mount path. You can also load a series of middleware functions together, which creates a sub-stack of the middleware system at a mount point.\n\nBind application-level middleware to an instance of the app object by using the and functions, where is the HTTP method of the request that the middleware function handles (such as GET, PUT, or POST) in lowercase.\n\nThis example shows a middleware function with no mount path. The function is executed every time the app receives a request.\n\nThis example shows a middleware function mounted on the path. The function is executed for any type of HTTP request on the path.\n\nThis example shows a route and its handler function (middleware system). The function handles GET requests to the path.\n\nHere is an example of loading a series of middleware functions at a mount point, with a mount path. It illustrates a middleware sub-stack that prints request info for any type of HTTP request to the path.\n\nRoute handlers enable you to define multiple routes for a path. The example below defines two routes for GET requests to the path. The second route will not cause any problems, but it will never get called because the first route ends the request-response cycle.\n\nThis example shows a middleware sub-stack that handles GET requests to the path.\n\nTo skip the rest of the middleware functions from a router middleware stack, call to pass control to the next route.\n\nThis example shows a middleware sub-stack that handles GET requests to the path.\n\nMiddleware can also be declared in an array for reusability.\n\nThis example shows an array with a middleware sub-stack that handles GET requests to the path\n\nRouter-level middleware works in the same way as application-level middleware, except it is bound to an instance of .\n\nLoad router-level middleware by using the and functions.\n\nThe following example code replicates the middleware system that is shown above for application-level middleware, by using router-level middleware:\n\n// a middleware function with no mount path. This code is executed for every request to the router // a middleware sub-stack shows request info for any type of HTTP request to the /user/:id path // a middleware sub-stack that handles GET requests to the /user/:id path // if the user ID is 0, skip to the next router // otherwise pass control to the next middleware function in this stack // handler for the /user/:id path, which renders a special page // mount the router on the app\n\nTo skip the rest of the router’s middleware functions, call to pass control back out of the router instance.\n\nThis example shows a middleware sub-stack that handles GET requests to the path.\n\nDefine error-handling middleware functions in the same way as other middleware functions, except with four arguments instead of three, specifically with the signature :\n\nFor details about error-handling middleware, see: Error handling.\n\nStarting with version 4.x, Express no longer depends on Connect. The middleware functions that were previously included with Express are now in separate modules; see the list of middleware functions.\n\nExpress has the following built-in middleware functions:\n• express.static serves static assets such as HTML files, images, and so on.\n• express.json parses incoming requests with JSON payloads. NOTE: Available with Express 4.16.0+\n• express.urlencoded parses incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads. NOTE: Available with Express 4.16.0+\n\nUse third-party middleware to add functionality to Express apps.\n\nInstall the Node.js module for the required functionality, then load it in your app at the application level or at the router level.\n\nThe following example illustrates installing and loading the cookie-parsing middleware function .\n\nFor a partial list of third-party middleware functions that are commonly used with Express, see: Third-party middleware."

        "document": "Middleware functions are the building blocks of any web server, especially in frameworks like ExpressJS. It plays a vital role in the request-response cycle. They are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the application’s request-response cycle.\n\nWhat is Middleware in Express?\n\nMiddleware in Express refers to functions that process requests before reaching the route handlers. These functions can modify request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, or call the next middleware function.\n• None Middleware functions are executed in the order they are defined.\n• None They can perform tasks like authentication, logging, or error handling.\n• (req, res, next) => {}: This is the middleware function where you can perform actions on the request and response objects before the final handler is executed.\n• next(): This function is called to pass control to the next middleware in the stack if the current one doesn’t end the request-response cycle.\n\nIn Express.js, middleware functions are executed sequentially in the order they are added to the application. When a request is received, it is passed through the middleware functions in the order they were defined. Each middleware can perform a task and either send a response or call the next() function to pass control to the next middleware function.\n\nHere’s how the typical flow looks:\n• Middleware functions are applied to the request, one by one.\n• None Each middleware can either:\n• Call next() to pass control to the next middleware.\n• None If no middleware ends the cycle, the route handler is reached, and a final response is sent.\n\nExpressJS offers different types of middleware and you should choose the middleware based on functionality required.\n• Application-level middleware: Bound to the entire application using app.use() app.METHOD() and executes for all routes.\n• Router-level middleware : Associated with specific routes using router.use() router.METHOD() and executes for routes defined within that router.\n• Error-handling middleware: Handles errors during the request-response cycle. Defined with four parameters (err, req, res, next).\n\nWhen you navigate to http://localhost:3000/, you will see:\n\nMiddleware can be chained from one to another, Hence creating a chain of functions that are executed in order. The last function sends the response back to the browser. So, before sending the response back to the browser the different middleware processes the request.\n\nThe next() function in the express is responsible for calling the next middleware function if there is one.\n\nModified requests will be available to each middleware via the next function\n• Middleware 1: Logs the HTTP method and URL of the incoming request.\n\nWhen a client makes a GET request to http://localhost:3000/, the server responds with:\n• Reusability: Middleware functions can be reused across different routes or applications.\n• Maintainability : Organizes code logically, making it easier to manage and update.\n• Performance Optimization : Allows for tasks like caching, compression, and security checks to be handled efficiently.\n\nBest Practices for Middleware in ExpressJS\n• None Always call next() to pass control to the next middleware unless you are ending the request-response cycle.\n• None Use specific middleware for different tasks (e.g., authentication, logging) to keep the code modular and clean.\n• None Place error-handling middleware at the end of the middleware stack to catch any unhandled errors.\n• None Avoid using synchronous code in middleware to prevent blocking the event loop.\n\nWhat is the purpose of next() in Express middleware?\n\nHow do I handle errors in middleware?\n\nCan middleware be applied to specific routes?\n\nIs it a good practice to have large middleware functions?\n\nHow can I avoid security issues with middleware?"

For this reason, the secret should contain at least 32 bytes of entropy.\n\nThe session store instance, defaults to a new instance.\n\nControl the result of unsetting (through , setting to , etc.).\n\nThe default value is .\n• The session will be destroyed (deleted) when the response ends.\n• The session in the store will be kept, but modifications made during the request are ignored and not saved.\n\nTo store or access session data, simply use the request property , which is (generally) serialized as JSON by the store, so nested objects are typically fine. For example below is a user-specific view counter:\n\nTo regenerate the session simply invoke the method. Once complete, a new SID and instance will be initialized at and the will be invoked.\n\nDestroys the session and will unset the property. Once complete, the will be invoked.\n\nReloads the session data from the store and re-populates the object. Once complete, the will be invoked.\n\nSave the session back to the store, replacing the contents on the store with the contents in memory (though a store may do something else--consult the store's documentation for exact behavior).\n\nThis method is automatically called at the end of the HTTP response if the session data has been altered (though this behavior can be altered with various options in the middleware constructor). Because of this, typically this method does not need to be called.\n\nThere are some cases where it is useful to call this method, for example, redirects, long-lived requests or in WebSockets.\n\nUpdates the property. Typically this is not necessary to call, as the session middleware does this for you.\n\nEach session has a unique ID associated with it. This property is an alias of and cannot be modified. It has been added to make the session ID accessible from the object.\n\nEach session has a unique cookie object accompany it. This allows you to alter the session cookie per visitor. For example we can set to to enable the cookie to remain for only the duration of the user-agent.\n\nAlternatively will return the time remaining in milliseconds, which we may also re-assign a new value to adjust the property appropriately. The following are essentially equivalent\n\nFor example when is set to (one minute), and 30 seconds has elapsed it will return until the current request has completed, at which time is called to reset to its original value.\n\nThe property returns the original (time-to-live), in milliseconds, of the session cookie.\n\nTo get the ID of the loaded session, access the request property . This is simply a read-only value set when a session is loaded/created.\n\nEvery session store must be an and implement specific methods. The following methods are the list of required, recommended, and optional.\n• Required methods are ones that this module will always call on the store.\n• Recommended methods are ones that this module will call on the store if available.\n• Optional methods are ones this module does not call at all, but helps present uniform stores to users.\n\nFor an example implementation view the connect-redis repo.\n\nThis optional method is used to get all sessions in the store as an array. The should be called as .\n\nThis required method is used to destroy/delete a session from the store given a session ID ( ). The should be called as once the session is destroyed.\n\nThis optional method is used to delete all sessions from the store. The should be called as once the store is cleared.\n\nThis optional method is used to get the count of all sessions in the store. The should be called as .\n\nThis required method is used to get a session from the store given a session ID ( ). The should be called as .\n\nThe argument should be a session if found, otherwise or if the session was not found (and there was no error). A special case is made when to act like .\n\nThis required method is used to upsert a session into the store given a session ID ( ) and session ( ) object. The callback should be called as once the session has been set in the store.\n\nThis recommended method is used to \"touch\" a given session given a session ID ( ) and session ( ) object. The should be called as once the session has been touched.\n\nThis is primarily used when the store will automatically delete idle sessions and this method is used to signal to the store the given session is active, potentially resetting the idle timer.\n\nThe following modules implement a session store that is compatible with this module.

        "document": "A module is a JavaScript library/file that you can import into other code using Node's function. Express itself is a module, as are the middleware and database libraries that we use in our Express applications. The code below shows how we import a module by name, using the Express framework as an example. First we invoke the function, specifying the name of the module as a string ( ), and calling the returned object to create an Express application. We can then access the properties and functions of the application object. You can also create your own modules that can be imported in the same way. Note: You will want to create your own modules, because this allows you to organize your code into manageable parts — a monolithic single-file application is hard to understand and maintain. Using modules also helps you manage your namespace, because only the variables you explicitly export are imported when you use a module. To make objects available outside of a module you just need to expose them as additional properties on the object. For example, the square.js module below is a file that exports and methods: We can import this module using , and then call the exported method(s) as shown: const square = require(\"./square\"); // Here we require() the name of the file without the (optional) .js file extension console.log(`The area of a square with a width of 4 is ${square.area(4)}`); Note: You can also specify an absolute path to the module (or a name, as we did initially). If you want to export a complete object in one assignment instead of building it one property at a time, assign it to as shown below (you can also do this to make the root of the exports object a constructor or other function): Note: You can think of as a shortcut to within a given module. In fact, is just a variable that gets initialized to the value of before the module is evaluated. That value is a reference to an object (empty object in this case). This means that holds a reference to the same object referenced by . It also means that by assigning another value to it's no longer bound to . For a lot more information about modules see Modules (Node API docs).\n\nJavaScript code frequently uses asynchronous rather than synchronous APIs for operations that may take some time to complete. A synchronous API is one in which each operation must complete before the next operation can start. For example, the following log functions are synchronous, and will print the text to the console in order (First, Second). By contrast, an asynchronous API is one in which the API will start an operation and immediately return (before the operation is complete). Once the operation finishes, the API will use some mechanism to perform additional operations. For example, the code below will print out \"Second, First\" because even though method is called first, and returns immediately, the operation doesn't complete for several seconds. Using non-blocking asynchronous APIs is even more important on Node than in the browser because Node is a single-threaded event-driven execution environment. \"Single threaded\" means that all requests to the server are run on the same thread (rather than being spawned off into separate processes). This model is extremely efficient in terms of speed and server resources, but it does mean that if any of your functions call synchronous methods that take a long time to complete, they will block not just the current request, but every other request being handled by your web application. There are a number of ways for an asynchronous API to notify your application that it has completed. The most common way is to register a callback function when you invoke the asynchronous API, that will be called back when the operation completes. This is the approach used above. Note: Using callbacks can be quite \"messy\" if you have a sequence of dependent asynchronous operations that must be performed in order because this results in multiple levels of nested callbacks. This problem is commonly known as \"callback hell\". This problem can be reduced by good coding practices (see http://callbackhell.com/), using a module like async, or refactoring the code to native JavaScript features like Promises and async/await. Node offers the function to do the callback → Promise conversion ergonomically. Note: A common convention for Node and Express is to use error-first callbacks. In this convention, the first value in your callback functions is an error value, while subsequent arguments contain success data. There is a good explanation of why this approach is useful in this blog: The Node.js Way - Understanding Error-First Callbacks (fredkschott.com).\n\nIn our Hello World Express example (see above), we defined a (callback) route handler function for HTTP requests to the site root ( ). The callback function takes a request and a response object as arguments. In this case, the method calls on the response to return the string \"Hello World!\" There are a number of other response methods for ending the request/response cycle, for example, you could call to send a JSON response or to send a file. Note: You can use any argument names you like in the callback functions; when the callback is invoked the first argument will always be the request and the second will always be the response. It makes sense to name them such that you can identify the object you're working with in the body of the callback. The Express application object also provides methods to define route handlers for all the other HTTP verbs, which are mostly used in exactly the same way: There is a special routing method, , which will be called in response to any HTTP method. This is used for loading middleware functions at a particular path for all request methods. The following example (from the Express documentation) shows a handler that will be executed for requests to irrespective of the HTTP verb used (provided it is supported by the http module). app.all(\"/secret\", function (req, res, next) { console.log(\"Accessing the secret section…\"); next(); // pass control to the next handler }); Routes allow you to match particular patterns of characters in a URL, and extract some values from the URL and pass them as parameters to the route handler (as attributes of the request object passed as a parameter). Often it is useful to group route handlers for a particular part of a site together and access them using a common route-prefix (e.g. a site with a Wiki might have all wiki-related routes in one file and have them accessed with a route prefix of /wiki/). In Express this is achieved by using the object. For example, we can create our wiki route in a module named wiki.js, and then export the object, as shown below: Note: Adding routes to the object is just like adding routes to the object (as shown previously). To use the router in our main app file we would then the route module (wiki.js), then call on the Express application to add the Router to the middleware handling path. The two routes will then be accessible from and . We'll show you a lot more about working with routes, and in particular about using the , later on in the linked section Routes and controllers.\n\nMiddleware is used extensively in Express apps, for tasks from serving static files to error handling, to compressing HTTP responses. Whereas route functions end the HTTP request-response cycle by returning some response to the HTTP client, middleware functions typically perform some operation on the request or response and then call the next function in the \"stack\", which might be more middleware or a route handler. The order in which middleware is called is up to the app developer. Note: The middleware can perform any operation, execute any code, make changes to the request and response object, and it can also end the request-response cycle. If it does not end the cycle then it must call to pass control to the next middleware function (or the request will be left hanging). Most apps will use third-party middleware in order to simplify common web development tasks like working with cookies, sessions, user authentication, accessing request and JSON data, logging, etc. You can find a list of middleware packages maintained by the Express team (which also includes other popular 3rd party packages). Other Express packages are available on the npm package manager. To use third party middleware you first need to install it into your app using npm. For example, to install the morgan HTTP request logger middleware, you'd do this: You could then call on the Express application object to add the middleware to the stack: Note: Middleware and routing functions are called in the order that they are declared. For some middleware the order is important (for example if session middleware depends on cookie middleware, then the cookie handler must be added first). It is almost always the case that middleware is called before setting routes, or your route handlers will not have access to functionality added by your middleware. You can write your own middleware functions, and you are likely to have to do so (if only to create error handling code). The only difference between a middleware function and a route handler callback is that middleware functions have a third argument , which middleware functions are expected to call if they are not that which completes the request cycle (when the middleware function is called, this contains the next function that must be called). You can add a middleware function to the processing chain for all responses with , or for a specific HTTP verb using the associated method: , , etc. Routes are specified in the same way for both cases, though the route is optional when calling . The example below shows how you can add the middleware function using both approaches, and with/without a route. const express = require(\"express\"); const app = express(); // An example middleware function const a_middleware_function = function (req, res, next) { // Perform some operations next(); // Call next() so Express will call the next middleware function in the chain. }; // Function added with use() for all routes and verbs app.use(a_middleware_function); // Function added with use() for a specific route app.use(\"/some-route\", a_middleware_function); // A middleware function added for a specific HTTP verb and route app.get(\"/\", a_middleware_function); app.listen(3000); Note: Above we declare the middleware function separately and then set it as the callback. In our previous route handler function we declared the callback function when it was used. In JavaScript, either approach is valid. The Express documentation has a lot more excellent documentation about using and writing Express middleware.\n\nTemplate engines (also referred to as \"view engines\" in Express) allow you to specify the structure of an output document in a template, using placeholders for data that will be filled in when a page is generated. Templates are often used to create HTML, but can also create other types of documents. Express has support for a number of template engines, notably Pug (formerly \"Jade\"), Mustache, and EJS. Each has its own strengths for addressing particular use cases (relative comparisons can easily be found via Internet search). The Express application generator uses Jade as its default, but it also supports several others. In your application settings code you set the template engine to use and the location where Express should look for templates using the 'views' and 'view engine' settings, as shown below (you will also have to install the package containing your template library too!) const express = require(\"express\"); const path = require(\"path\"); const app = express(); // Set directory to contain the templates ('views') app.set(\"views\", path.join(__dirname, \"views\")); // Set view engine to use, in this case 'some_template_engine_name' app.set(\"view engine\", \"some_template_engine_name\"); The appearance of the template will depend on what engine you use. Assuming that you have a template file named \"index.<template_extension>\" that contains placeholders for data variables named 'title' and \"message\", you would call in a route handler function to create and send the HTML response: For more information see Using template engines with Express (Express docs)."

(Default on)\n• - This is specific to the C client, and has no effect on this Node.js implementation. (Default off)\n• - Old flag for the 4.1 protocol. (Default on)\n• - Use SSL after handshake to encrypt data in transport. This feature is controlled though the connection option, so the flag has no effect. (Default off)\n• - Verify the server certificate during SSL set up. This feature is controlled though the connection option, so the flag has no effect. (Default off)\n• - Asks for the transaction status flags. (Default on)\n\nThere are two ways to end a connection. Terminating a connection gracefully is done by calling the method:\n\nThis will make sure all previously enqueued queries are still executed before sending a packet to the MySQL server. If a fatal error occurs before the packet can be sent, an argument will be provided to the callback, but the connection will be terminated regardless of that.\n\nAn alternative way to end the connection is to call the method. This will cause an immediate termination of the underlying socket. Additionally guarantees that no more events or callbacks will be triggered for the connection.\n\nUnlike the method does not take a callback argument.\n\nRather than creating and managing connections one-by-one, this module also provides built-in connection pooling using . Read more about connection pooling.\n\nCreate a pool and use it directly:\n\nThis is a shortcut for the -> -> code flow. Using is useful to share connection state for subsequent queries. This is because two calls to may use two different connections and run in parallel. This is the basic structure:\n\nIf you would like to close the connection and remove it from the pool, use instead. The pool will create a new connection the next time one is needed.\n\nConnections are lazily created by the pool. If you configure the pool to allow up to 100 connections, but only ever use 5 simultaneously, only 5 connections will be made. Connections are also cycled round-robin style, with connections being taken from the top of the pool and returning to the bottom.\n\nWhen a previous connection is retrieved from the pool, a ping packet is sent to the server to check if the connection is still good.\n\nPools accept all the same options as a connection. When creating a new connection, the options are simply passed to the connection constructor. In addition to those options pools accept a few extras:\n• : The milliseconds before a timeout occurs during the connection acquisition. This is slightly different from , because acquiring a pool connection does not always involve making a connection. If a connection request is queued, the time the request spends in the queue does not count towards this timeout. (Default: )\n• : Determines the pool's action when no connections are available and the limit has been reached. If , the pool will queue the connection request and call it when one becomes available. If , the pool will immediately call back with an error. (Default: )\n• : The maximum number of connections to create at once. (Default: )\n• : The maximum number of connection requests the pool will queue before returning an error from . If set to , there is no limit to the number of queued connection requests. (Default: )\n\nThe pool will emit an event when a connection is acquired from the pool. This is called after all acquiring activity has been performed on the connection, right before the connection is handed to the callback of the acquiring code.\n\nThe pool will emit a event when a new connection is made within the pool. If you need to set session variables on the connection before it gets used, you can listen to the event.\n\nThe pool will emit an event when a callback has been queued to wait for an available connection.\n\nThe pool will emit a event when a connection is released back to the pool. This is called after all release activity has been performed on the connection, so the connection will be listed as free at the time of the event.\n\nWhen you are done using the pool, you have to end all the connections or the Node.js event loop will stay active until the connections are closed by the MySQL server. This is typically done if the pool is used in a script or when trying to gracefully shutdown a server. To end all the connections in the pool, use the method on the pool:\n\nThe method takes an optional callback that you can use to know when all the connections are ended.\n\nOnce is called, and other operations can no longer be performed. Wait until all connections in the pool are released before calling . If you use the shortcut method , in place of → → , wait until it completes.\n\ncalls on every active connection in the pool. This queues a packet on the connection and sets a flag to prevent from creating new connections. All commands / queries already in progress will complete, but new commands won't execute.\n• : If , will attempt to reconnect when connection fails. (Default: )\n• : If connection fails, node's increases. When is greater than , remove a node in the . (Default: )\n• : If connection fails, specifies the number of milliseconds before another connection attempt will be made. If set to , then node will be removed instead and never re-used. (Default: )\n• : The default selector. (Default: )\n• : Select the first node available unconditionally.\n\nMySQL offers a changeUser command that allows you to alter the current user and other aspects of the connection without shutting down the underlying socket:\n\nThe available options for this feature are:\n• : The name of the new user (defaults to the previous one).\n• : The password of the new user (defaults to the previous one).\n• : The new charset (defaults to the previous one).\n• : The new database (defaults to the previous one).\n\nA sometimes useful side effect of this functionality is that this function also resets any connection state (variables, transactions, etc.).\n\nErrors encountered during this operation are treated as fatal connection errors by this module.\n\nYou may lose the connection to a MySQL server due to network problems, the server timing you out, the server being restarted, or crashing. All of these events are considered fatal errors, and will have the . See the Error Handling section for more information.\n\nRe-connecting a connection is done by establishing a new connection. Once terminated, an existing connection object cannot be re-connected by design.\n\nWith Pool, disconnected connections will be removed from the pool freeing up space for a new connection to be created on the next getConnection call.\n\nWith PoolCluster, disconnected connections will count as errors against the related node, incrementing the error code for that node. Once there are more than errors on a given node, it is removed from the cluster. When this occurs, the PoolCluster may emit a error if there are no longer any matching nodes for the pattern. The config can be set to restore offline nodes after a given timeout.\n\nThe most basic way to perform a query is to call the method on an object (like a , , or instance).\n\nThe simplest form of is , where a SQL string is the first argument and the second is a callback:\n\nThe second form comes when using placeholder values (see escaping query values):\n\nThe third form comes when using various advanced options on the query, like escaping query values, joins with overlapping column names, timeouts, and type casting.\n\nNote that a combination of the second and third forms can be used where the placeholder values are passed as an argument and not in the options object. The argument will override the in the option object.\n\nIf the query only has a single replacement character ( ), and the value is not , , or an array, it can be passed directly as the second argument to :\n\nCaution These methods of escaping values only works when the NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES SQL mode is disabled (which is the default state for MySQL servers).\n\nCaution This library performs client-side escaping, as this is a library to generate SQL strings on the client side. The syntax for functions like may look similar to a prepared statement, but it is not and the escaping rules from this module are used to generate a resulting SQL string. The purpose of escaping input is to avoid SQL Injection attacks. In order to support enhanced support like and formatting, this module will escape based on the shape of the passed in JavaScript value, and the resulting escaped string may be more than a single value. When structured user input is provided as the value to escape, care should be taken to validate the shape of the input to validate the output will be what is expected.\n\nIn order to avoid SQL Injection attacks, you should always escape any user provided data before using it inside a SQL query. You can do so using the , or methods:\n\nAlternatively, you can use characters as placeholders for values you would like to have escaped like this:\n\nMultiple placeholders are mapped to values in the same order as passed. For example, in the following query equals , equals , equals , and will be :\n\nThis looks similar to prepared statements in MySQL, however it really just uses the same method internally.\n\nCaution This also differs from prepared statements in that all are replaced, even those contained in comments and strings.\n\nDifferent value types are escaped differently, here is how:\n• Arrays are turned into list, e.g. turns into\n• Nested arrays are turned into grouped lists (for bulk inserts), e.g. turns into\n• Objects that have a method will have called and the returned value is used as the raw SQL.\n• Objects are turned into pairs for each enumerable property on the object. If the property's value is a function, it is skipped; if the property's value is an object, toString() is called on it and the returned value is used.\n• / are left as-is. MySQL does not support these, and trying to insert them as values will trigger MySQL errors until they implement support.\n\nThis escaping allows you to do neat things like this:\n\nAnd the method allows you to form complex queries with functions:\n\nTo generate objects with a method, the method can be used. This creates an object that will be left un-touched when using in a placeholder, useful for using functions as dynamic values:\n\nCaution The string provided to will skip all escaping functions when used, so be careful when passing in unvalidated input.\n\nIf you feel the need to escape queries by yourself, you can also use the escaping function directly:\n\nIf you can't trust an SQL identifier (database / table / column name) because it is provided by a user, you should escape it with , or like this:\n\nIt also supports adding qualified identifiers. It will escape both parts.\n\nIf you do not want to treat as qualified identifiers, you can set the second argument to in order to keep the string as a literal identifier:\n\nAlternatively, you can use characters as placeholders for identifiers you would like to have escaped like this:\n\nPlease note that this last character sequence is experimental and syntax might change\n\nWhen you pass an Object to or , is used to avoid SQL injection in object keys.\n\nYou can use mysql.format to prepare a query with multiple insertion points, utilizing the proper escaping for ids and values. A simple example of this follows:\n\nFollowing this you then have a valid, escaped query that you can then send to the database safely. This is useful if you are looking to prepare the query before actually sending it to the database. As mysql.format is exposed from SqlString.format you also have the option (but are not required) to pass in stringifyObject and timezone, allowing you provide a custom means of turning objects into strings, as well as a location-specific/timezone-aware Date.\n\nIf you prefer to have another type of query escape format, there's a connection configuration option you can use to define a custom format function. You can access the connection object if you want to use the built-in or any other connection function.\n\nHere's an example of how to implement another format:\n\nIf you are inserting a row into a table with an auto increment primary key, you can retrieve the insert id like this:\n\nWhen dealing with big numbers (above JavaScript Number precision limit), you should consider enabling option to be able to read the insert id as a string, otherwise it will throw an error.\n\nThis option is also required when fetching big numbers from the database, otherwise you will get values rounded to hundreds or thousands due to the precision limit.\n\nYou can get the number of affected rows from an insert, update or delete statement.\n\nYou can get the number of changed rows from an update statement.\n\n\"changedRows\" differs from \"affectedRows\" in that it does not count updated rows whose values were not changed.\n\nYou can get the MySQL connection ID (\"thread ID\") of a given connection using the property.\n\nThe MySQL protocol is sequential, this means that you need multiple connections to execute queries in parallel. You can use a Pool to manage connections, one simple approach is to create one connection per incoming http request.\n\nSometimes you may want to select large quantities of rows and process each of them as they are received. This can be done like this:\n\nPlease note a few things about the example above:\n• Usually you will want to receive a certain amount of rows before starting to throttle the connection using . This number will depend on the amount and size of your rows.\n• / operate on the underlying socket and parser. You are guaranteed that no more events will fire after calling .\n• You MUST NOT provide a callback to the method when streaming rows.\n• The event will fire for both rows as well as OK packets confirming the success of a INSERT/UPDATE query.\n• It is very important not to leave the result paused too long, or you may encounter The time limit for this is determined by the net_write_timeout setting on your MySQL server.\n\nAdditionally you may be interested to know that it is currently not possible to stream individual row columns, they will always be buffered up entirely. If you have a good use case for streaming large fields to and from MySQL, I'd love to get your thoughts and contributions on this.\n\nThe query object provides a convenience method that wraps query events into a Readable Stream object. This stream can easily be piped downstream and provides automatic pause/resume, based on downstream congestion and the optional . The parameter of the stream is set to and cannot be changed (if you need a byte stream, you will need to use a transform stream, like objstream for example).\n\nFor example, piping query results into another stream (with a max buffer of 5 objects) is simply:\n\nSupport for multiple statements is disabled for security reasons (it allows for SQL injection attacks if values are not properly escaped). To use this feature you have to enable it for your connection:\n\nOnce enabled, you can execute multiple statement queries like any other query:\n\nAdditionally you can also stream the results of multiple statement queries:\n\nIf one of the statements in your query causes an error, the resulting Error object contains a property which tells you which statement caused it. MySQL will also stop executing any remaining statements when an error occurs.\n\nPlease note that the interface for streaming multiple statement queries is experimental and I am looking forward to feedback on it.\n\nYou can call stored procedures from your queries as with any other mysql driver. If the stored procedure produces several result sets, they are exposed to you the same way as the results for multiple statement queries.\n\nWhen executing joins, you are likely to get result sets with overlapping column names.\n\nBy default, node-mysql will overwrite colliding column names in the order the columns are received from MySQL, causing some of the received values to be unavailable.\n\nHowever, you can also specify that you want your columns to be nested below the table name like this:\n\nOr use a string separator to have your results merged.\n\nSimple transaction support is available at the connection level:\n\nPlease note that beginTransaction(), commit() and rollback() are simply convenience functions that execute the START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK commands respectively. It is important to understand that many commands in MySQL can cause an implicit commit, as described in the MySQL documentation\n\nA ping packet can be sent over a connection using the method. This method will send a ping packet to the server and when the server responds, the callback will fire. If an error occurred, the callback will fire with an error argument.\n\nEvery operation takes an optional inactivity timeout option. This allows you to specify appropriate timeouts for operations. It is important to note that these timeouts are not part of the MySQL protocol, and rather timeout operations through the client. This means that when a timeout is reached, the connection it occurred on will be destroyed and no further operations can be performed.\n\nThis module comes with a consistent approach to error handling that you should review carefully in order to write solid applications.\n\nMost errors created by this module are instances of the JavaScript Error object. Additionally they typically come with two extra properties:\n• : String, contains the MySQL server error symbol if the error is a MySQL server error (e.g. ), a Node.js error code if it is a Node.js error (e.g. ), or an internal error code (e.g. ).\n• : Number, contains the MySQL server error number. Only populated from MySQL server error.\n• : Boolean, indicating if this error is terminal to the connection object. If the error is not from a MySQL protocol operation, this property will not be defined.\n• : String, contains the full SQL of the failed query. This can be useful when using a higher level interface like an ORM that is generating the queries.\n• : String, contains the five-character SQLSTATE value. Only populated from MySQL server error.\n• : String, contains the message string that provides a textual description of the error. Only populated from MySQL server error.\n\nFatal errors are propagated to all pending callbacks. In the example below, a fatal error is triggered by trying to connect to a blocked port. Therefore the error object is propagated to both pending callbacks:\n\nNormal errors however are only delegated to the callback they belong to. So in the example below, only the first callback receives an error, the second query works as expected:\n\nLast but not least: If a fatal errors occurs and there are no pending callbacks, or a normal error occurs which has no callback belonging to it, the error is emitted as an event on the connection object. This is demonstrated in the example below:\n\nNote: events are special in node. If they occur without an attached listener, a stack trace is printed and your process is killed.\n\ntl;dr: This module does not want you to deal with silent failures. You should always provide callbacks to your method calls. If you want to ignore this advice and suppress unhandled errors, you can do this:\n\nThis module is exception safe. That means you can continue to use it, even if one of your callback functions throws an error which you're catching using 'uncaughtException' or a domain.\n\nFor your convenience, this driver will cast mysql types into native JavaScript types by default. The default behavior can be changed through various Connection options. The following mappings exist:\n• BIT (last byte will be filled with 0 bits as necessary)\n\nNote text in the binary character set is returned as , rather than a string.\n• TIME (could be mapped to Date, but what date would be set?)\n• GEOMETRY (never used those, get in touch if you do)\n\nIt is not recommended (and may go away / change in the future) to disable type casting, but you can currently do so on either the connection:\n\nOr on the query level:\n\nYou can also pass a function and handle type casting yourself. You're given some column information like database, table and name and also type and length. If you just want to apply a custom type casting to a specific type you can do it and then fallback to the default.\n\nThe function is provided two arguments and and is expected to return the value for the given field by invoking the parser functions through the object.\n\nThe argument is a object and contains data about the field that need to be parsed. The following are some of the properties on a object:\n• - a string of the database the field came from.\n• - a string of the table the field came from.\n• - a string of the field name.\n• - a string of the field type in all caps.\n• - a number of the field length, as given by the database.\n\nThe argument is a that, when called, will return the default type conversion for the given field.\n\nWhen getting the field data, the following helper methods are present on the object:\n• - parse the field as a geometry value.\n\nThe MySQL protocol is a text-based protocol. This means that over the wire, all field types are represented as a string, which is why only string-like functions are available on the object. Based on the type information (like ), the type cast should convert the string field into a different JavaScript type (like a ).\n\nHere's an example of converting to boolean:\n\nWARNING: YOU MUST INVOKE the parser using one of these three field functions in your custom typeCast callback. They can only be called once.\n\nIf you are running into problems, one thing that may help is enabling the mode for the connection:\n\nThis will print all incoming and outgoing packets on stdout. You can also restrict debugging to packet types by passing an array of types to debug:\n\nto restrict debugging to the query and data packets.\n\nIf that does not help, feel free to open a GitHub issue. A good GitHub issue will have:\n• The minimal amount of code required to reproduce the problem (if possible)\n• As much debugging output and information about your environment (mysql version, node version, os, etc.) as you can gather.\n\nSecurity issues should not be first reported through GitHub or another public forum, but kept private in order for the collaborators to assess the report and either (a) devise a fix and plan a release date or (b) assert that it is not a security issue (in which case it can be posted in a public forum, like a GitHub issue).\n\nThe primary private forum is email, either by emailing the module's author or opening a GitHub issue simply asking to whom a security issues should be addressed to without disclosing the issue or type of issue.\n\nAn ideal report would include a clear indication of what the security issue is and how it would be exploited, ideally with an accompanying proof of concept (\"PoC\") for collaborators to work against and validate potentional fixes against.\n\nThis project welcomes contributions from the community.
