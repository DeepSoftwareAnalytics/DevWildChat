        "document": "You must have SELECT privilege on each column used in a SELECT command. The use of FOR NO KEY UPDATE , FOR UPDATE , FOR SHARE or FOR KEY SHARE requires UPDATE privilege as well (for at least one column of each table so selected).\n\nIf FOR UPDATE , FOR NO KEY UPDATE , FOR SHARE or FOR KEY SHARE is specified, the SELECT statement locks the selected rows against concurrent updates. (See The Locking Clause below.)\n\nIf the LIMIT (or FETCH FIRST ) or OFFSET clause is specified, the SELECT statement only returns a subset of the result rows. (See LIMIT Clause below.)\n\nIf the ORDER BY clause is specified, the returned rows are sorted in the specified order. If ORDER BY is not given, the rows are returned in whatever order the system finds fastest to produce. (See ORDER BY Clause below.)\n\nUsing the operators UNION , INTERSECT , and EXCEPT , the output of more than one SELECT statement can be combined to form a single result set. The UNION operator returns all rows that are in one or both of the result sets. The INTERSECT operator returns all rows that are strictly in both result sets. The EXCEPT operator returns the rows that are in the first result set but not in the second. In all three cases, duplicate rows are eliminated unless ALL is specified. The noise word DISTINCT can be added to explicitly specify eliminating duplicate rows. Notice that DISTINCT is the default behavior here, even though ALL is the default for SELECT itself. (See UNION Clause , INTERSECT Clause , and EXCEPT Clause below.)\n\nSELECT DISTINCT eliminates duplicate rows from the result. SELECT DISTINCT ON eliminates rows that match on all the specified expressions. SELECT ALL (the default) will return all candidate rows, including duplicates. (See DISTINCT Clause below.)\n\nThe actual output rows are computed using the SELECT output expressions for each selected row or row group. (See SELECT List below.)\n\nIf the GROUP BY clause is specified, or if there are aggregate function calls, the output is combined into groups of rows that match on one or more values, and the results of aggregate functions are computed. If the HAVING clause is present, it eliminates groups that do not satisfy the given condition. (See GROUP BY Clause and HAVING Clause below.) Although query output columns are nominally computed in the next step, they can also be referenced (by name or ordinal number) in the GROUP BY clause.\n\nIf the WHERE clause is specified, all rows that do not satisfy the condition are eliminated from the output. (See WHERE Clause below.)\n\nAll elements in the FROM list are computed. (Each element in the FROM list is a real or virtual table.) If more than one element is specified in the FROM list, they are cross-joined together. (See FROM Clause below.)\n\nAll queries in the WITH list are computed. These effectively serve as temporary tables that can be referenced in the FROM list. A WITH query that is referenced more than once in FROM is computed only once, unless specified otherwise with NOT MATERIALIZED . (See WITH Clause below.)\n\nSELECT retrieves rows from zero or more tables. The general processing of SELECT is as follows:\n\nThe clause allows you to specify one or more subqueries that can be referenced by name in the primary query. The subqueries effectively act as temporary tables or views for the duration of the primary query. Each subquery can be a , , , , , , or statement. When writing a data-modifying statement ( , , , or ) in , it is usual to include a clause. It is the output of , not the underlying table that the statement modifies, that forms the temporary table that is read by the primary query. If is omitted, the statement is still executed, but it produces no output so it cannot be referenced as a table by the primary query. A name (without schema qualification) must be specified for each query. Optionally, a list of column names can be specified; if this is omitted, the column names are inferred from the subquery. If is specified, it allows a subquery to reference itself by name. Such a subquery must have the form where the recursive self-reference must appear on the right-hand side of the . Only one recursive self-reference is permitted per query. Recursive data-modifying statements are not supported, but you can use the results of a recursive query in a data-modifying statement. See Section 7.8 for an example. Another effect of is that queries need not be ordered: a query can reference another one that is later in the list. (However, circular references, or mutual recursion, are not implemented.) Without , queries can only reference sibling queries that are earlier in the list. When there are multiple queries in the clause, should be written only once, immediately after . It applies to all queries in the clause, though it has no effect on queries that do not use recursion or forward references. The optional clause computes a search sequence column that can be used for ordering the results of a recursive query in either breadth-first or depth-first order. The supplied column name list specifies the row key that is to be used for keeping track of visited rows. A column named will be added to the result column list of the query. This column can be ordered by in the outer query to achieve the respective ordering. See Section 7.8.2.1 for examples. The optional clause is used to detect cycles in recursive queries. The supplied column name list specifies the row key that is to be used for keeping track of visited rows. A column named will be added to the result column list of the query. This column will be set to when a cycle has been detected, else to . Furthermore, processing of the recursive union will stop when a cycle has been detected. and must be constants and they must be coercible to a common data type, and the data type must have an inequality operator. (The SQL standard requires that they be Boolean constants or character strings, but PostgreSQL does not require that.) By default, and (of type ) are used. Furthermore, a column named will be added to the result column list of the query. This column is used internally for tracking visited rows. See Section 7.8.2.2 for examples. Both the and the clause are only valid for recursive queries. The must be a (or ) of two (or equivalent) commands (no nested s). If both clauses are used, the column added by the clause appears before the columns added by the clause. The primary query and the queries are all (notionally) executed at the same time. This implies that the effects of a data-modifying statement in cannot be seen from other parts of the query, other than by reading its output. If two such data-modifying statements attempt to modify the same row, the results are unspecified. A key property of queries is that they are normally evaluated only once per execution of the primary query, even if the primary query refers to them more than once. In particular, data-modifying statements are guaranteed to be executed once and only once, regardless of whether the primary query reads all or any of their output. However, a query can be marked to remove this guarantee. In that case, the query can be folded into the primary query much as though it were a simple sub- in the primary query's clause. This results in duplicate computations if the primary query refers to that query more than once; but if each such use requires only a few rows of the query's total output, can provide a net savings by allowing the queries to be optimized jointly. is ignored if it is attached to a query that is recursive or is not side-effect-free (i.e., is not a plain containing no volatile functions). By default, a side-effect-free query is folded into the primary query if it is used exactly once in the primary query's clause. This allows joint optimization of the two query levels in situations where that should be semantically invisible. However, such folding can be prevented by marking the query as . That might be useful, for example, if the query is being used as an optimization fence to prevent the planner from choosing a bad plan. PostgreSQL versions before v12 never did such folding, so queries written for older versions might rely on to act as an optimization fence.\n\nThe clause specifies one or more source tables for the . If multiple sources are specified, the result is the Cartesian product (cross join) of all the sources. But usually qualification conditions are added (via ) to restrict the returned rows to a small subset of the Cartesian product. The clause can contain the following elements: The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing table or view. If is specified before the table name, only that table is scanned. If is not specified, the table and all its descendant tables (if any) are scanned. Optionally, can be specified after the table name to explicitly indicate that descendant tables are included. A substitute name for the item containing the alias. An alias is used for brevity or to eliminate ambiguity for self-joins (where the same table is scanned multiple times). When an alias is provided, it completely hides the actual name of the table or function; for example given , the remainder of the must refer to this item as not . If an alias is written, a column alias list can also be written to provide substitute names for one or more columns of the table. A clause after a indicates that the specified should be used to retrieve a subset of the rows in that table. This sampling precedes the application of any other filters such as clauses. The standard PostgreSQL distribution includes two sampling methods, and , and other sampling methods can be installed in the database via extensions. The and sampling methods each accept a single which is the fraction of the table to sample, expressed as a percentage between 0 and 100. This argument can be any -valued expression. (Other sampling methods might accept more or different arguments.) These two methods each return a randomly-chosen sample of the table that will contain approximately the specified percentage of the table's rows. The method scans the whole table and selects or ignores individual rows independently with the specified probability. The method does block-level sampling with each block having the specified chance of being selected; all rows in each selected block are returned. The method is significantly faster than the method when small sampling percentages are specified, but it may return a less-random sample of the table as a result of clustering effects. The optional clause specifies a number or expression to use for generating random numbers within the sampling method. The seed value can be any non-null floating-point value. Two queries that specify the same seed and values will select the same sample of the table, if the table has not been changed meanwhile. But different seed values will usually produce different samples. If is not given then a new random sample is selected for each query, based upon a system-generated seed. Note that some add-on sampling methods do not accept , and will always produce new samples on each use. A sub- can appear in the clause. This acts as though its output were created as a temporary table for the duration of this single command. Note that the sub- must be surrounded by parentheses, and an alias can be provided in the same way as for a table. A command can also be used here. A query is referenced by writing its name, just as though the query's name were a table name. (In fact, the query hides any real table of the same name for the purposes of the primary query. If necessary, you can refer to a real table of the same name by schema-qualifying the table's name.) An alias can be provided in the same way as for a table. Function calls can appear in the clause. (This is especially useful for functions that return result sets, but any function can be used.) This acts as though the function's output were created as a temporary table for the duration of this single command. If the function's result type is composite (including the case of a function with multiple parameters), each attribute becomes a separate column in the implicit table. When the optional clause is added to the function call, an additional column of type will be appended to the function's result column(s). This column numbers the rows of the function's result set, starting from 1. By default, this column is named . An alias can be provided in the same way as for a table. If an alias is written, a column alias list can also be written to provide substitute names for one or more attributes of the function's composite return type, including the ordinality column if present. Multiple function calls can be combined into a single -clause item by surrounding them with . The output of such an item is the concatenation of the first row from each function, then the second row from each function, etc. If some of the functions produce fewer rows than others, null values are substituted for the missing data, so that the total number of rows returned is always the same as for the function that produced the most rows. If the function has been defined as returning the data type, then an alias or the key word must be present, followed by a column definition list in the form . The column definition list must match the actual number and types of columns returned by the function. When using the syntax, if one of the functions requires a column definition list, it's preferred to put the column definition list after the function call inside . A column definition list can be placed after the construct only if there's just a single function and no clause. To use together with a column definition list, you must use the syntax and put the column definition list inside . For the and join types, a join condition must be specified, namely exactly one of , , or . See below for the meaning. A clause combines two items, which for convenience we will refer to as “tables”, though in reality they can be any type of item. Use parentheses if necessary to determine the order of nesting. In the absence of parentheses, s nest left-to-right. In any case binds more tightly than the commas separating -list items. All the options are just a notational convenience, since they do nothing you couldn't do with plain and . returns all rows in the qualified Cartesian product (i.e., all combined rows that pass its join condition), plus one copy of each row in the left-hand table for which there was no right-hand row that passed the join condition. This left-hand row is extended to the full width of the joined table by inserting null values for the right-hand columns. Note that only the clause's own condition is considered while deciding which rows have matches. Outer conditions are applied afterwards. Conversely, returns all the joined rows, plus one row for each unmatched right-hand row (extended with nulls on the left). This is just a notational convenience, since you could convert it to a by switching the left and right tables. returns all the joined rows, plus one row for each unmatched left-hand row (extended with nulls on the right), plus one row for each unmatched right-hand row (extended with nulls on the left). is an expression resulting in a value of type (similar to a clause) that specifies which rows in a join are considered to match. A clause of the form is shorthand for . Also, implies that only one of each pair of equivalent columns will be included in the join output, not both. If a name is specified, it provides a table alias for the join columns. Only the join columns listed in the clause are addressable by this name. Unlike a regular , this does not hide the names of the joined tables from the rest of the query. Also unlike a regular , you cannot write a column alias list — the output names of the join columns are the same as they appear in the list. is shorthand for a list that mentions all columns in the two tables that have matching names. If there are no common column names, is equivalent to . is equivalent to , that is, no rows are removed by qualification. They produce a simple Cartesian product, the same result as you get from listing the two tables at the top level of , but restricted by the join condition (if any). The key word can precede a sub- item. This allows the sub- to refer to columns of items that appear before it in the list. (Without , each sub- is evaluated independently and so cannot cross-reference any other item.) can also precede a function-call item, but in this case it is a noise word, because the function expression can refer to earlier items in any case. A item can appear at top level in the list, or within a tree. In the latter case it can also refer to any items that are on the left-hand side of a that it is on the right-hand side of. When a item contains cross-references, evaluation proceeds as follows: for each row of the item providing the cross-referenced column(s), or set of rows of multiple items providing the columns, the item is evaluated using that row or row set's values of the columns. The resulting row(s) are joined as usual with the rows they were computed from. This is repeated for each row or set of rows from the column source table(s). The column source table(s) must be or joined to the item, else there would not be a well-defined set of rows from which to compute each set of rows for the item. Thus, although a construct such as is syntactically valid, it is not actually allowed for to reference .\n\nThe optional clause has the general form will condense into a single row all selected rows that share the same values for the grouped expressions. An used inside a can be an input column name, or the name or ordinal number of an output column ( list item), or an arbitrary expression formed from input-column values. In case of ambiguity, a name will be interpreted as an input-column name rather than an output column name. If any of , or are present as grouping elements, then the clause as a whole defines some number of independent . The effect of this is equivalent to constructing a between subqueries with the individual grouping sets as their clauses. The optional clause removes duplicate sets before processing; it does not transform the into a . For further details on the handling of grouping sets see Section 7.2.4. Aggregate functions, if any are used, are computed across all rows making up each group, producing a separate value for each group. (If there are aggregate functions but no clause, the query is treated as having a single group comprising all the selected rows.) The set of rows fed to each aggregate function can be further filtered by attaching a clause to the aggregate function call; see Section 4.2.7 for more information. When a clause is present, only those rows matching it are included in the input to that aggregate function. When is present, or any aggregate functions are present, it is not valid for the list expressions to refer to ungrouped columns except within aggregate functions or when the ungrouped column is functionally dependent on the grouped columns, since there would otherwise be more than one possible value to return for an ungrouped column. A functional dependency exists if the grouped columns (or a subset thereof) are the primary key of the table containing the ungrouped column. Keep in mind that all aggregate functions are evaluated before evaluating any “scalar” expressions in the clause or list. This means that, for example, a expression cannot be used to skip evaluation of an aggregate function; see Section 4.2.14. Currently, , , and cannot be specified with .\n\nThe optional clause has the general form where is a name that can be referenced from clauses or subsequent window definitions, and is [ ] [ PARTITION BY [, ...] ] [ ORDER BY [ ASC | DESC | USING ] [ NULLS { FIRST | LAST } ] [, ...] ] [ ] If an is specified it must refer to an earlier entry in the list; the new window copies its partitioning clause from that entry, as well as its ordering clause if any. In this case the new window cannot specify its own clause, and it can specify only if the copied window does not have one. The new window always uses its own frame clause; the copied window must not specify a frame clause. The elements of the list are interpreted in much the same fashion as elements of a clause, except that they are always simple expressions and never the name or number of an output column. Another difference is that these expressions can contain aggregate function calls, which are not allowed in a regular clause. They are allowed here because windowing occurs after grouping and aggregation. Similarly, the elements of the list are interpreted in much the same fashion as elements of a statement-level clause, except that the expressions are always taken as simple expressions and never the name or number of an output column. The optional defines the window frame for window functions that depend on the frame (not all do). The window frame is a set of related rows for each row of the query (called the current row). The can be one of where and can be one of and can be one of If is omitted it defaults to . Restrictions are that cannot be , cannot be , and the choice cannot appear earlier in the above list of and options than the choice does — for example is not allowed. The default framing option is , which is the same as ; it sets the frame to be all rows from the partition start up through the current row's last peer (a row that the window's clause considers equivalent to the current row; all rows are peers if there is no ). In general, means that the frame starts with the first row of the partition, and similarly means that the frame ends with the last row of the partition, regardless of , or mode. In mode, means that the frame starts or ends with the current row; but in or mode it means that the frame starts or ends with the current row's first or last peer in the ordering. The and options vary in meaning depending on the frame mode. In mode, the is an integer indicating that the frame starts or ends that many rows before or after the current row. In mode, the is an integer indicating that the frame starts or ends that many peer groups before or after the current row's peer group, where a peer group is a group of rows that are equivalent according to the window's clause. In mode, use of an option requires that there be exactly one column in the window definition. Then the frame contains those rows whose ordering column value is no more than less than (for ) or more than (for ) the current row's ordering column value. In these cases the data type of the expression depends on the data type of the ordering column. For numeric ordering columns it is typically of the same type as the ordering column, but for datetime ordering columns it is an . In all these cases, the value of the must be non-null and non-negative. Also, while the does not have to be a simple constant, it cannot contain variables, aggregate functions, or window functions. The option allows rows around the current row to be excluded from the frame, even if they would be included according to the frame start and frame end options. excludes the current row from the frame. excludes the current row and its ordering peers from the frame. excludes any peers of the current row from the frame, but not the current row itself. simply specifies explicitly the default behavior of not excluding the current row or its peers. Beware that the mode can produce unpredictable results if the ordering does not order the rows uniquely. The and modes are designed to ensure that rows that are peers in the ordering are treated alike: all rows of a given peer group will be in the frame or excluded from it. The purpose of a clause is to specify the behavior of window functions appearing in the query's list or clause. These functions can reference the clause entries by name in their clauses. A clause entry does not have to be referenced anywhere, however; if it is not used in the query it is simply ignored. It is possible to use window functions without any clause at all, since a window function call can specify its window definition directly in its clause. However, the clause saves typing when the same window definition is needed for more than one window function. Currently, , , and cannot be specified with . Window functions are described in detail in Section 3.5, Section 4.2.8, and Section 7.2.5.\n\nThe list (between the key words and ) specifies expressions that form the output rows of the statement. The expressions can (and usually do) refer to columns computed in the clause. Just as in a table, every output column of a has a name. In a simple this name is just used to label the column for display, but when the is a sub-query of a larger query, the name is seen by the larger query as the column name of the virtual table produced by the sub-query. To specify the name to use for an output column, write after the column's expression. (You can omit , but only if the desired output name does not match any PostgreSQL keyword (see Appendix C). For protection against possible future keyword additions, it is recommended that you always either write or double-quote the output name.) If you do not specify a column name, a name is chosen automatically by PostgreSQL. If the column's expression is a simple column reference then the chosen name is the same as that column's name. In more complex cases a function or type name may be used, or the system may fall back on a generated name such as . An output column's name can be used to refer to the column's value in and clauses, but not in the or clauses; there you must write out the expression instead. Instead of an expression, can be written in the output list as a shorthand for all the columns of the selected rows. Also, you can write as a shorthand for the columns coming from just that table. In these cases it is not possible to specify new names with ; the output column names will be the same as the table columns' names. According to the SQL standard, the expressions in the output list should be computed before applying , , or . This is obviously necessary when using , since otherwise it's not clear what values are being made distinct. However, in many cases it is convenient if output expressions are computed after and ; particularly if the output list contains any volatile or expensive functions. With that behavior, the order of function evaluations is more intuitive and there will not be evaluations corresponding to rows that never appear in the output. PostgreSQL will effectively evaluate output expressions after sorting and limiting, so long as those expressions are not referenced in , or . (As a counterexample, clearly must evaluate before sorting.) Output expressions that contain set-returning functions are effectively evaluated after sorting and before limiting, so that will act to cut off the output from a set-returning function. PostgreSQL versions before 9.6 did not provide any guarantees about the timing of evaluation of output expressions versus sorting and limiting; it depended on the form of the chosen query plan.\n\nThe optional clause has this general form: ORDER BY [ ASC | DESC | USING ] [ NULLS { FIRST | LAST } ] [, ...] The clause causes the result rows to be sorted according to the specified expression(s). If two rows are equal according to the leftmost expression, they are compared according to the next expression and so on. If they are equal according to all specified expressions, they are returned in an implementation-dependent order. Each can be the name or ordinal number of an output column ( list item), or it can be an arbitrary expression formed from input-column values. The ordinal number refers to the ordinal (left-to-right) position of the output column. This feature makes it possible to define an ordering on the basis of a column that does not have a unique name. This is never absolutely necessary because it is always possible to assign a name to an output column using the clause. It is also possible to use arbitrary expressions in the clause, including columns that do not appear in the output list. Thus the following statement is valid: SELECT name FROM distributors ORDER BY code; A limitation of this feature is that an clause applying to the result of a , , or clause can only specify an output column name or number, not an expression. If an expression is a simple name that matches both an output column name and an input column name, will interpret it as the output column name. This is the opposite of the choice that will make in the same situation. This inconsistency is made to be compatible with the SQL standard. Optionally one can add the key word (ascending) or (descending) after any expression in the clause. If not specified, is assumed by default. Alternatively, a specific ordering operator name can be specified in the clause. An ordering operator must be a less-than or greater-than member of some B-tree operator family. is usually equivalent to and is usually equivalent to . (But the creator of a user-defined data type can define exactly what the default sort ordering is, and it might correspond to operators with other names.) If is specified, null values sort after all non-null values; if is specified, null values sort before all non-null values. If neither is specified, the default behavior is when is specified or implied, and when is specified (thus, the default is to act as though nulls are larger than non-nulls). When is specified, the default nulls ordering depends on whether the operator is a less-than or greater-than operator. Note that ordering options apply only to the expression they follow; for example does not mean the same thing as . Character-string data is sorted according to the collation that applies to the column being sorted. That can be overridden at need by including a clause in the , for example . For more information see Section 4.2.10 and Section 23.2.\n\nThe clause consists of two independent sub-clauses: The parameter specifies the maximum number of rows to return, while specifies the number of rows to skip before starting to return rows. When both are specified, rows are skipped before starting to count the rows to be returned. If the expression evaluates to NULL, it is treated as , i.e., no limit. If evaluates to NULL, it is treated the same as . SQL:2008 introduced a different syntax to achieve the same result, which PostgreSQL also supports. It is: OFFSET { ROW | ROWS } FETCH { FIRST | NEXT } [ ] { ROW | ROWS } { ONLY | WITH TIES } In this syntax, the or value is required by the standard to be a literal constant, a parameter, or a variable name; as a PostgreSQL extension, other expressions are allowed, but will generally need to be enclosed in parentheses to avoid ambiguity. If is omitted in a clause, it defaults to 1. The option is used to return any additional rows that tie for the last place in the result set according to the clause; is mandatory in this case, and is not allowed. and as well as and are noise words that don't influence the effects of these clauses. According to the standard, the clause must come before the clause if both are present; but PostgreSQL is laxer and allows either order. When using , it is a good idea to use an clause that constrains the result rows into a unique order. Otherwise you will get an unpredictable subset of the query's rows — you might be asking for the tenth through twentieth rows, but tenth through twentieth in what ordering? You don't know what ordering unless you specify . The query planner takes into account when generating a query plan, so you are very likely to get different plans (yielding different row orders) depending on what you use for and . Thus, using different / values to select different subsets of a query result will give inconsistent results unless you enforce a predictable result ordering with . This is not a bug; it is an inherent consequence of the fact that SQL does not promise to deliver the results of a query in any particular order unless is used to constrain the order. It is even possible for repeated executions of the same query to return different subsets of the rows of a table, if there is not an to enforce selection of a deterministic subset. Again, this is not a bug; determinism of the results is simply not guaranteed in such a case."

        "document": "PostgreSQL is an advanced relational database system that supports both relational (SQL) and non-relational (JSON) queries. It is free and open-source. Null values in a database field can have a negative effect on data analysis, query results, and application logic.\n\nIn PostgreSQL, NULL is used to denote missing values or unknown states, which might at times complicate the way of queries and analysis. The handling of NULL values is particularly important when working with PostgreSQL for null values retrieving even from specific columns should not be included. This article explores various methods to achieve this objective.\n\nThe IS NOT NULL Operator in PostgreSQL is a simple and powerful way to retrieve data without the NULL values in a specified column. Using \"IS NOT NULL\" in the SELECT statement's WHERE clause allows you to remove all rows containing NULL value in the specified column.\n\nIn this query, only rows where the 'column_name' is not NULL will be included in the result set. This method ensures that only non-NULL values are retrieved from the specified column.\n\nExample Queries on Retrieving Data without NULL values in a Certain Column\n\nFirst, let's create a table named workers and insert some data into it:\n\nTo see the content of the table you can execute the below command:\n\nNow we have some data in our table, let's proceed with example queries on retrieving data without NULL values in the 'age' column.\n\nExample 1: Retrieve all rows where 'age' is not NULL.\n• SELECT: This part of the query specifies that you want to select all columns (*) from the table.\n• FROM workers: Here, you're specifying the table from which you want to retrieve data. In this case, it's the \" workers\n• WHERE age IS NOT NULL: This is the filtering condition. The WHERE clause is used to specify conditions that must be met for a row to be included in the result set. Here, you're filtering rows where the \"age\" column is not NULL\n\nExample 2: Retrieve names and emails of workers with non-NULL 'age'.\n• SELECT: This part of the query specifies that you want to select name, email column from the table.\n• FROM workers: Here, you're specifying the table from which you want to retrieve data. In this case, it's the \" workers\n• WHERE age IS NOT NULL: This is the filtering condition. The WHERE clause is used to specify conditions that must be met for a row to be included in the result set.

In this case, it's the \" workers\n• WHERE age IS NOT NULL: Here, you're filtering rows where the \" age NULL and the age is greater than or equal to 30.\n\nExtracting data without NULL values in a specific column in PostgreSQL reduces error in data analysis and application performance. Through using the IS NOT NULL operator and combining it with other conditions, if necessary, programmers will be able to filter NULL values from query results without affecting the actual data storage. Through studying and mastering these techniques, developers gain the ability to write detailed and straight to the point queries in PostgreSQL."

        "document": "Summary: in this tutorial, you will learn about the PostgreSQL function that returns the first non-null argument.\n\nThe function accepts a list of arguments and returns the first non-null argument.\n\nHere’s the basic syntax of the function:\n\nThe function accepts multiple arguments and returns the first argument that is not null. If all arguments are null, the function will return null.\n\nThe function evaluates arguments from left to right until it finds the first non-null argument. All the remaining arguments from the first non-null argument are not evaluated.\n\nThe function provides the same functionality as or function provided by SQL standard. MySQL has the IFNULL function whereas Oracle Database offers the function.\n\nLet’s take some examples of using the function.\n\nThe following example uses the function to return the first non-null argument:\n\nSince both arguments are non-null, the function returns the first argument:\n\nThe following example uses the function to return the first non-null argument:\n\nBecause the first argument is NULL and the second argument is non-null, the function returns the second argument:\n\nIn practice, you often use the function to substitute a default value for null when querying data from nullable columns.\n\nFor example, if you want to display the excerpt from a blog post and the excerpt is not provided, you can use the first 150 characters of the content of the post.\n\nTo achieve this, you can use the function as follows:\n\n2) Using the COALESCE() function with table data\n\nThe table has four columns:\n• : the primary key that identifies the item in the table.\n• : the price of the product.\n• : the discount on the product.\n\nSecond, insert some rows into the table:\n\nThird, retrieve the net prices of the products from the table:\n\nThe output indicates that the net price of the product is null.\n\nThe issue is that the of the product is null. Therefore, the net price is NULL because it involves NULL in the calculation.\n\nWith an assumption that if the discount is null, the net price is zero, you can use the function in the query as follows:\n\nNow the net price of the product is because the query uses zero instead of NULL when calculating the net price.\n\nBesides using the function, you can use the CASE expression to handle the NULL in this example.\n\nFor example, the following query uses the expression to achieve the same result:\n\nIn this query, if the discount is null then use zero (0) otherwise use the discount value to calculate the net price.\n\nIn terms of performance, the function and expression are the same.\n\nIt is recommended to use function because it makes the query shorter and easier to read.\n• Use the function to substitute null values in the query."

        "document": "Learn how to handle null values with ease and efficiency using the versatile COALESCE() function in PostgreSQL, with practical examples and insights.\n\nIn the world of database management, SQL plays an important role in accessing and manipulating data efficiently. Considering the mountains of data to manipulate, we are often faced with null values which refer to the absence of a value in a particular data field. Handling null values is especially important when our data manipulation techniques involve calculations, comparisons, or data retrievals. SQL Coalesce() function is specifically crafted to address this exact predicament.\n\nWhat is COALESCE() Function in SQL?\n\nSQL COALESCE() is a versatile function that allows you to evaluate multiple expressions and return the first non-null value. The manner in which it handles null values is efficient and concise. So you must know how to use COALESCE() function in your queries to handle null values better.\n\nYou can use the SQL COALESCE() function to replace multiple lines of complex conditional statements as it simplifies all the hassle.\n\nLet us look at the syntax of a SQL COALESCE() function in a general sense.\n\nHere, the values viz., value1, value2,... valuen, are the columns or expressions that we wish to evaluate for null values.\n\nOut of these values, the SQL COALESCE() function returns the first non-null value from the list. It is this functionality that is beneficial when dealing with columns that might contain null values.\n\nThe reason we called the COALESCE() function ‘versatile’ is that it provides a way for us to replace the null value with an alternate or default value. This neat trick makes our life easier when we go on to perform calculations and manipulations of those columns riddled with null values.\n\nHere is a more practical syntax of the SQL COALESCE() function that highlights its provision for an alternate value.\n\nAs shown above, say value1 or column1 is the one that has the null values, then we can provide an alternate value with which to replace the null values so that we are left with a consistent dataset. If the value is not null, the original value is returned.\n\nOnce a non-null value has encountered, the rest of the list of expressions will NOT be evaluated.\n\nThere are various SQL functions that are similar that are available in other formats of relational database management systems (RDBMS).\n\nYou might be familiar with the concept if you have used the NVL() function in Oracle which also accommodates the COALESCE() function. The NVL() function also takes two arguments, the former being the expression to be evaluated for null values and the latter, the replacement value. If the value is null, the replacement value is returned and if the value is not null, the original expression is returned.\n\nLikewise, in SQL Server, we can find a similar function called ISNULL(). This function follows the same syntax of taking two arguments: the expression and the replacement value.\n\nIf we consider the world of MySQL, we can find the IFNULL() function that follows the same syntax and returns an alternate value when the prior expression is null.\n\nTo learn more about this function, check out our post “SQL IFNULL() Function”.\n\nIn PostgreSQL, we also have functions that perform similarly but operate differently.\n\nFor instance, the NULLIF() function takes two arguments as shown below. It returns NULL, if value1 is equal to value2. Otherwise, it returns value1.\n\nHow to Use the SQL COALESCE() Function\n\nBy now you know that the COALESCE() function is a crucial aspect of SQL in validating and replacing null values with default values.\n\nThe SQL COALESCE() function can also be used with multiple arguments, as shown in the first syntax. It will evaluate each of those columns or expressions in the mentioned order until it reaches a non-null value to be returned.\n\nThere are some properties of the SQL COALESCE() function to keep in mind:\n• The arguments must be of the same data type.\n• The function can contain multiple arguments.\n• It always evaluates for an integer first. So, an integer followed by a character expression yields an integer as an output.\n\nLet’s check out an example to understand bullet point 3.\n\nSay, you have written the following query:\n\nThe output of this query is ‘1’.\n\nBut if we have it the other way around.\n\nAn error will be thrown reading, ‘Conversion failed when converting the varchar value ‘SARAH’ to data type int’. So the COALESCE() function always evaluates for an integer first.\n\nThe COALESCE() function is simply a syntactic shortcut for the CASE expression. Let me explain how.\n\nLet’s consider the CASE expression shown below:\n\nIf we wrote this using COALESCE() function, it would do the same thing but more concisely. See below:\n\nLet’s start with a simple example of the replacement of a single column with an alternate value.\n\nSay, we are provided with a table that contains the customer contact information of a store. The columns are ID and phone number. Not all the customers have provided their phone numbers. In this scenario, we can fill the gaps in the database with ‘N/A’.\n\nHere is the input table ‘customer_contact’:\n\nThe query would look like this:\n\nAnd the output will be:\n\nIn this example, the COALESCE() function replaced the NULL values in the Phone_Numbers column with ‘N/A’ so that there is consistency in the column.\n\nIn case there are multiple columns with null values that you wish to handle, then the SQL COALESCE() function accommodates that as well. Let us check out the following example.\n\nIn this table, both the Manufacturer and Supplier columns contain null values. Fortunately,, COALESCE() function can handle multiple columns as well. The query turns out to be as follows.\n\nThe COALESCE() function returns the first non-null value from the Manufacturer and Supplier columns. If both values are NULL, then ‘N/A’ will replace the null value. This way, we can consolidate the provider information from multiple columns into one. In the output table below, we can see how it looks in the end.\n\nLet us now, look at an example that involves a complex calculation and how the SQL COALESCE() function can be used to make such a calculation in the query.\n\nThe input table here is ‘order_details’ which has the following data.\n\nThe table contains the columns ID, product names, prices and quantities. Some entries of price and quantity information are null. In order for the user to calculate the Order_Total which is the product of price and quantity, these NULL values have to be replaced with some meaning value to avoid undefined entries in the table.\n\nSo, let us write the query as below:\n\nTherefore, the output of this query is:\n\nSQL COALESCE() function is utilized to ensure that valid data is retuned when comparing values or a default value is returned. This functionality is widely used in SQL all over the world. Let us look into this example where the goal is to validate the phone numbers of the emergency contacts of employees.\n\nSay we have the following table from the database to consider: EmergencyContact\n\nHere, the columns ‘homephone’, ‘workphone’, and ‘cellphone’ all contain NULL values. Since our requirement is to have non-null values in the phone number fields for employees that do not have an emergency contact, we will replace the ‘NULL’ values with ‘N/A’.\n\nThe output of this query will give us the first non-null value out of the three phone number columns such that the employees with at least one contact number will be updated accordingly in the table.\n\nHere is the output:\n\nNow, we are about to concatenate some values from a table and let us check out how we can handle the null values while we perform this String concatenation.\n\nIn our example, we will concatenate the first_name, middle_name and the last_name columns from a Personnel table. Since not every name contains a middle name, there might be null values in the middle_name column.\n\nIn PostgreSQL or SQL Server, when you concatenate a non-null value with a null value, it only returns ‘null’ because every time it encounters null, it returns the same.\n\nTo counter this issue, we can use the COALESCE() function to replace the null values with an empty value as shown below.\n\nSay we have the input table: Personnel\n\nThe query to replace null values from the middle_name column is as follows:\n\nThe output of the query looks like this:\n\nAnother great function of the SQL COALESCE() function is to handle the initial null values when pivoting multiple rows into a single row. Let us check out the example below that demonstrates this function.\n\nLet’s consider the ‘sales’ table given below.\n\nOur aim is to pivot the data to get the total quantity sold for each product in every year so that we have separate columns for the North and South regions.\n\nLet’s check out the query for the same.\n\nIn this query, the SQL COALESCE() function is coupled with the SUM and CASE statements to pivot data. The CASE statement conditionally sums the quantity based on the region. If the region is ‘North’, then it calculates the sum of quantity for the North region; else it returns null.\n\nAnd to replace the resulting null values with ‘0’, we are using the COALESCE() function.\n\nThe output of this query displays the total quantity sold for each product in each region. The output table is as follows:\n\nLet us explore another use for the COALESCE() function in SQL.\n\nIn the following example, we will use the COALESCE() function to compare values from the table below.\n\nNow, we will compute the total salary paid for each of these employees using the COALESCE() function and create a computed column.\n\nMore often than not, tables require the computation of values that depend on multiple existing columns. These computed columns rely on one or more other columns for their values. To effectively handle null values in these scenarios, the COALESCE() function is employed to create computed columns.\n\nHere is the query:\n\nThe ‘TOTAL_SALARY’ column computed represents the total calculated salary of each employee which depends on the employee’s hourly wage, salary, commission, and the number of sales.\n\nIf ‘HOURLY_WAGE’ is a non-null value, then it is multiplied by 40 for 40 hours per week and then again by 52 which is 52 weeks per year. If the value is null, however, the COALESCE() function ensures the salary is not null and adds the commission multiplied by the number of sales.\n\nThe output of the table with the computed column is as follows:\n\nIn this article, we discussed the SQL COALESCE() function and its usage in handling null values in various specific scenarios. The versatility and adaptability of this function will be extremely beneficial for all data analysts out there in handling null values in calculation, comparisons as well as data retrievals. We explored a multitude of examples in this context to get a deeper understanding of the function.\n\nTo learn more SQL functions and interview questions in varied difficulty levels, be sure to explore our post “SQL interview questions”.
