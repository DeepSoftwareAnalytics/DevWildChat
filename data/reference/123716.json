        "document": "What is this algorithm? The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a new optimization technique for solving optimization problems. This algorithm includes three operators to simulate the search for prey, encircling prey, and bubble-net foraging behavior of humpback whales.\n\nWOA has been designed to solve single-objective optimization problems. This algorithm has been implemented in a wide range of programming languages. You can download the source code at the bottom of this page.\n\nOne of the best improvements of WOA called E-WOA (Credits to Dr. Mohammad H. Nadimi-Shahraki).\n\nOne of the best improvements of WOA surveys (Credits to Dr. Mohammad H. Nadimi-Shahraki)."
