        "document": "I’ve read that the best way to learn something is to blog about it. Since I’ve been learning data science for some time now, I thought why not give it a try. So, here it is; my first ever blog post.\n\nNow, there are a lot of brilliant resources out there in the web from which one can learn. But when you’re just getting started, it can get a little overwhelming with the amount of resources available. Particularly in the field of data science, you can find all these buzz words like Data Science, AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and so much more. It gets confusing — where to start?\n\nIf you’re anything like me, you’ll find some cool applications that use data science or AI, and you can’t wait to get started to build those yourself. You’ll start to learn the basics but soon fail to decide how to put them all together and ultimately get frustrated. My advice to anyone getting started is to have patience. Don’t look too far ahead, just focus on what’s in front of you. Data science or programming in general is an art and you’ll get there one step at a time. I’m still not there, but I’m striving for it.\n\nLearning the basics is important, definitely. But what is the point of learning if you cannot solve any real problem? I believe whenever you’re learning something, you must have an end goal. My aim in this post will be to try to solve problems; very simple problems, but problems nonetheless. And while going from the problem to the solution, share some of the basics of the very first step of data science — NumPy.\n\nWait, but what is NumPy?\n\nNumPy stands for Numeric Python. As the docs states, NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It is used for performing numeric operations on arrays. NumPy is better than python list in terms of size, speed and functionality. Detail description for comparison between python list and NumPy arrays can be found in this link.\n\nBefore starting to use NumPy, it needs to be installed in your system. You can install it using pip or anaconda. The code in this post uses Python3 and NumPy installed with anaconda. I won’t be going into much detail about the installation. See this link for how to install NumPy.\n\nEnough talk. Let’s get to the good stuff.\n\nYou can find the complete code in this post in the link below.\n\nBefore we can begin performing any sort of computation with NumPy or any other package, the first step always is to import the package. So, let’s import NumPy.\n\nHere, we give a shorter name to NumPy — np. This is known as aliasing. Henceforth, whenever we need to access any methods from the NumPy package, we will do so using ‘np’. See this link for more on aliasing.\n\nWeren’t we going to solve problems?\n\nYes. Now that we have imported NumPy, we can use it to perform various sorts of computation. So, let’s now define the first problem.\n\nYou are given 5 cylindrical containers with different radius and heights ranging between 5 and 25 cm. Find out\n\na) the volume of water that each container can contain,\n\nb) the total volume of water that all containers can contain,\n\nc) which container can hold the highest volume and how much,\n\nd) which container can hold the least volume and how much,\n\ne) what is the mean, median and standard deviation of the volumes of water that can be contained in the containers?\n\nThat’s basic arithmetic. I don’t need NumPy to solve that.\n\nOf course you don’t. And Python packages were built to and are capable of solving much more complex problems. But the aim here is to give just a basic idea of how NumPy works, so that these techniques may later be applied to a problem of much greater magnitude. All I’m trying to do, is not scare away the newbies.\n\nFirst we need the radius and heights for the 5 cylindrical containers. The values for radius and heights are defined to be ranging between 5 and 25 cm. Let’s first define these in variables.\n\nThe number of items is 10 because we need 2 values for each of the five containers — one for the radius and the other for the height.\n\nJust a little heads up; unlike other resources in the web about NumPy that follow a specific pattern or the order in which the different attributes or methods are introduced, this post won’t be doing that. Since our aim is to solve the problem at hand, we will move forward introducing concepts in the order that will help us solve the problem. So, it’s going to be all random; speaking of which, let’s generate some random numbers.\n\nabove takes three parameters — the lower limit 5, the upper limit 25 and number of items 10. The result of this execution will be that will be assigned a NumPy array of 10 random numbers between 5 and 25. That is one way to create a NumPy array. Note that here the lower limit is inclusive and the upper limit is exclusive. So, 25 never appears on the array. is an interesting method. It takes a single argument (0 above) and what it does is, it returns a set of random numbers. What is interesting about it is the fact that, no matter when you execute the above block of code — now, after lunch or one year from now — you always get back the same set of random numbers. In contrast if you remove from the above block of code, you get back a different collection of random numbers on each execution. I’ve used 0 here for seed, but you can use any integer; you’ll just get back a different set of random numbers than mine.\n\nNOTE: There are also other methods to generate random numbers. generates integers. If you need floating point numbers, you can use and . You can explore these yourself.\n\nIf you now print out , you’ll get a NumPy array like this\n\nHere we can see that there is a single opening and closing square bracket. This shows that is a one dimensional array. To verify this further, you can use which returns the value , denoting that is 1D. Now, to verify that there are in fact 10 items in the array, we can use which returns , the length of the array. Also to find out what type of values are contained in the list, you can use , which in this case will return denoting that the array contains integer numbers.\n\nNext, let’s look at the shape of this array by using , which returns . Here the comma separates the number of items along each dimension. Since is 1D, there is no number after the comma. These are just some attributes to get familiar with NumPy. Let’s get back to the problem.\n\nSo, we need radius and heights for the cylinders, but right now all we have is a plain array of numbers. Let’s reorganize that so that the numbers appear in pairs, one for each cylinder. For this, we use the method.\n\nThe reshape method changes the shape of the NumPy array into any dimension we specify; the only requirement is that the product of the number of items along each dimension is equal to the total number of items. Here, we convert into a 2D array with 5 rows (one for each container) and 2 columns (one for radius and the other for height) and store it in . Now, if you print out , you’ll see something like the following.\n\nAs we can see, there are 2 opening and closing square brackets, so this is a 2D array. Verify this using . The shape also changes now. Try and you’ ll see that it returns .\n\nNow that we have a 2D array let’s separate the radius and the height arrays. For this we’re going to use slicing. Here we just deal with two columns, so the slicing will be pretty simple one. For in-depth details on slicing, see this tutorial.\n\nLet’s say that the first column represents the radius and the second represents the heights. Let’s slice the .\n\nThis defines that we are taking all rows(:) and only the first column(0). Similarly, for height, we take all rows(:) and only the second column(1).\n\nNow that we have all the values for radius and height, we can finally calculate the volume for the cylinders. As you probably know, the volume of a cylinder can be computed as follows:\n\nIf we now print , it returns an array like\n\nWith a single line of code, it has computed the volumes for all 5 cylinders. Here, we are just taking a 1D array with 5 items. NumPy is capable of performing multi-dimensional array computations with hundreds and thousands of items along each dimension quickly and very efficiently. That is the power of NumPy.\n\nNow, to find the total volume of the water contained in all the cylinders, we can simply sum the volumes of all the cylinders from the above array.\n\nThe total volume can also be calculated in an alternative way, without calculating the volumes of the individual cylinders. The way to do that is calculating the dot product of radius and height.\n\nand both give the same result. The dot product works here because both radius_squared and height are one dimensional. For a two dimensional matrix, it must meet the requirement that the number of columns of the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows of the second matrix. So, if two 2D matrices have same dimensions, before performing dot product, it is necessary to find the transpose of one of the matrix using method.\n\nNow, to find which cylinder can hold the maximum volume of water, we can use the method and the index of this cylinder in the array can be found by using the method.\n\nSimilarly, we can use the method to find the minimum volume and to find the index of the cylinder in the array.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the mean, median and standard deviation of the volumes of the cylinders.\n\n25 cards numbered 1 through 25 are randomly distributed equally amongst 5 people. Find the sum of cards for each person such that for the 1st person, the sum is the value of 1st card minus the sum of rest of the cards; for the 2nd person, the sum is the value of 2nd card minus the sum of rest of the cards, and so on. The person for whom the sum of the cards is greatest will be the winner. Find the winner.\n\nThis time we need 25 numbers from 1 to 25. In Problem 1, we generated a NumPy array by using the method. Now, let’s see a second method to generate a NumPy array. This time we’ll use the method. Note that it’s arange and not arrange.\n\nLike the method, the lower limit is inclusive and upper limit is exclusive. The lower limit, if not defined, will cause the NumPy array to start from 0. We also have a parameter for , which if defined, will generated multiples of the between start and end limits. At this point, if you check , you’ll have the following array.\n\nNow that we have the cards numbered from 1 to 25, let’s shuffle them before distributing it. To do that, we use .\n\nNow, if we look at , we’ll have an array that looks like this.\n\nThis is just one of the possible ways. That’s because the method changes the order of the on every run. Yours is going to be completely different.\n\nGreat. We have our cards shuffled. Let’s now distribute them equally among the 5 people, so 5 cards for each person.\n\nlooks something like this.\n\n5 cards each for 5 people arranged in a 2D matrix. Perfect. Now, all we need to do is find the sum for each person. For this, add the diagonal element and subtract the others. So, the sum for the 1st person will be , the sum for the 2nd person will be , and so on. To do that, we need a matrix that has the diagonal elements same as above, but the other elements are negated. First, let’s get that diagonal using the Identity Matrix.\n\nAn eye for an I makes the whole world blind. Well, except the diagonals.\n\nTo generate an Identity Matrix , we use the method. Since is a square matrix , we only need one argument. In this case, we need a 5x5 matrix.\n\nNow, if we multiply, with , an element by element multiplication will retain only the diagonal elements and remove all others.\n\nSo, will look something like the following.\n\nNext, we need the negated non-diagonal elements. To do this, we just need a matrix that has 0 in the diagonal and -1 everywhere else. That can be obtained if we deduct a Unit Matrix from the Identity Matrix . is a matrix with all ones. doesn’t need to be a square matrix so we need to define both the numbers of rows and the number of columns.\n\nSo, now looks like\n\nNote that the argument to is a tuple (5,5) instead of just 5,5 like in the case of and other methods we’ve seen so far. There’s also a similar method that generates a matrix of given shape with all zeros. For now, let’s generate the matrix we need.\n\nWhen we deduct the Unit Matrix from the Identity Matrix, we get the following matrix.\n\nDiagonals are 0s and the rest are -1s. Again we perform element-wise multiplication of with to obtained our required matrix.\n\nnow looks something like this.\n\nNow, all we need to do is combine the and using method.\n\nElement-wise addition results in to looks something like this.\n\nFinally, all there is left to do is perform row-wise addition on the .\n\nHere, performs row-wise addition. If you need column-wise addition, use .\n\nAt the end you’ll have a matrix that contains the sum for each person which looks like the following.\n\nThe one with the highest number is the winner. To find the index of the winner, we use .\n\nAs @Payal Bhatia mentioned in her response, the above is technically a column-wise addition and not row-wise. At first glance, it might look like we are doing row-wise addition and indeed that is what we wanted. But, the way NumPy sum works is a little more complicated than this. Follow the link below to get a better intuition of how NumPy sum works.\n\nYou are given a rope of length 5m. Cut the rope into 9 parts such that each part is of equal length.\n\nWe need to cut the rope at equidistant points such that there are 9 parts. So, besides the and points, we need 8 more points; a total of 10 points.\n\nTo find the equidistant points, we use the method.\n\nThis will give us the following array.\n\nSo, excluding the first and last entries in the array, the rest are the points where the rope must be cut so that we have 9 parts of equal length.\n\nis often confused with . produces a NumPy array that goes from start to end (excluded) by using the third argument as a step. produces a NumPy array that contains equidistant points from start to end (included) by using the third argument as the number of points to be calculated between the two ends.\n\nI want to build cool stuff, not this.\n\nSure, this post didn’t contain any fancy visualizations or introduce any cool models that you can showcase. But, NumPy is the basic building block of all the cool stuff that is to come. Also, this post didn’t cover all there is to learn about NumPy. But now you’re well versed to explore on your own. And that is the end of this post, but the beginning of everything else in Data Science.\n\nIn the next post, we’ll be looking at another fundamental package in Data Science — pandas."

        "document": "In many applications, image data can be combined to create three-dimensional scenes or data volumes. Such data is acquired in a host of different ways: using pictures taken of an object from different perspectives, using special sensors such as LIDAR, or by medical imaging processes like MRI or CT. Three dimensional data derived from images can be used in many interesting ways, such as:\n• more accurate inspection of components at manufacturing sites\n• allowing us to see forgotten ruins covered by the jungle\n• providing powerful ways for surgeons to more accurately plan and execute complex operations and verify that treatment was successful\n• improving the performance and accuracy of robotic surgery Python in general, and NumPy in specific has become important in working with volumetric image data. In this article, we will look at ways in which you can use NumPy to work with a stack of CT images as a cohesive dataset, use features of NumPy such as boolean masks to improve the contrast, and show how to visualize the data as a series. This article is Part 4 of a larger series showing how NumPy can be used to model data for machine learning and visualization. If you have not already done so, checkout Part 1, which provides an overview of NumPy and how to work with image data. A Jupyter notebook with the code in the article can be downloaded here. A Docker environment with NumPy, Pandas, and other dependencies needed to run the code can be found here.\n\nFor this example, we will be using a set of CT images. Computed Tomography is a special type of x-ray imaging in which a narrow beam of radiation is quickly rotated around the body, producing a signal that is processed by a computer to create a a series of cross-sectional images (or slices) of the body. Because of how it is acquired and the ability to stack the slices, a CT scan has more information than a traditional (two-dimensional) x-ray. When working with CT scans, you typically acquire and stack the images starting at a patient's feet and moving toward the head. CT scans have only a single channel of data, which makes them similar to grayscale images. Because the image is based on x-ray diffraction, the color (or intensity) of the image will be based on how dense the part of the body through which the x-ray passed was. Less dense tissue -- such as lung (which is mostly air), fat, or water -- will appear dark. More dense tissue -- such as muscle and bone -- will appear light.\n\nThe single image represents a pretty standard, unprocessed scan. It was selected more or less at random from the stack and happens to come from about mid-level in the chest. While completely adequate, it could be enhanced before being passed to a radiologist for reading or to a machine learning algorithm for segmentation. One common enhancement is to improve the contrast between different tissue types, such as bone and muscle. While some distinction between the tissues is visible in this image, it is subtle. Before performing such processing, however, it is important to make sure that the images in the series are uniform. While CT is a pretty consistent imaging modality, it is not uncommon to get differences in pixel intensity between the layers. The quickest way to make such determinations is to sample the images in the scan and generate a panel plot with many images side-by-side. The code in the listing below creates a helper method to manage visualization of the series. It takes a NumPy array with the data series and outputs a panel plot with a specified number of rows and columns.\n• Because we only want to visualize part of the series, the method includes a parameter to control the size of the step: . It also provides a second parameter to control the number of columns the panel image should have: .\n• From the panel and the size of the image series, the number of rows is calculated as . If you haven't seen it before, is the operator for integer division in Python 3.\n• The individual panels in the diagram are created using the method. Each iteration through the sequence moves the figure to the next panel in the sequence.\n• The image is displayed using , again utilizing the grayscale color map.\n\nWithin CT images, the pixel values will often range from -1024 HU to 3000 HU. -1000 is no (or very minimal) defraction, associated with air. +3000 is associated with very high density objects, metal or contrast agent. Body tissues are somewhere in-between. The histogram shows that there is a huge set of pixels corresponding to air and a second set corresponding to tissue. Removing the air and high contrast pixels would allow for the tissue contrast to increase. As a rule of thumb, gray-scale images look better when the left-hand edge of the useful pixel values are mapped to black and the right-hand edge of useful pixels is mapped to white. Re-mapping to this range is called \"windowing\" or \"leveling.\" When done programmatically, it is sometimes called \"contrast stretching.\" In this part of the article, we will contrast stretch by doing a couple of things. First, we are going to throw away data we don't care about: very bright pixels and shades of gray currently encoded by air. Then, we will re-map the values so that there is more spread between the different tissue types. Histogram of pixel intensities from the CT volume. There are two spikes, one near -1000 and another near 0. This is due to a deliberate normalization of the CT data that (probably) occurred during acquisition.\n\nWe can throw away the useless data by creating a threshold with two cutoff points. While there are a lot of ways this might be implemented, here we will generate a boolean mask from the NumPy array selecting for values between two bounds: a lower bound and an upper bound. From visual inspection of the histogram, air values seem to be less than -250. High contrast pixels appear to be above 1000 in intensity (or 1250, just to prevent the inadvertent exclusion of meaningful data). As part of our processing, after we generate the mask, we will then shift all values by 1024 (the minimum value in the distribution) so that air (black) starts at 0. If the values are not shifted, when the boolean mask is applied all values will become 0. At present, \"0\" is in the middle of the tissue values."

        "document": "In the world of data analysis and scientific computing, efficiency and accuracy are key🎯. This is where NumPy, one of the most influential libraries in the Python ecosystem, comes in.\n\nThis article dives into the heart of NumPy, exploring how this powerful tool has become an indispensable mainstay for data scientists, engineers and analysts around the world (myself included 😅).\n\nNumPy not only facilitates complex mathematical and statistical operations, but also serves as the foundation upon which other essential libraries in the field of data analysis are built. Its ability to handle large arrays and matrices with surprising efficiency makes it an irreplaceable tool for anyone interested in data science.\n\nWhat is NumPy and Why is it Important? 🤔\n\nRoughly speaking, NumPy (short for Numerical Python) is an open source library that provides support for large, multidimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. What sets NumPy apart is its speed and efficiency, thanks to its C implementation and its focus on vectorized operations.\n\nThe importance of NumPy in the field of data science and numerical analysis is immense:\n• Efficient Data Manipulation: NumPy allows complex numerical computations to be performed more efficiently than with native Python data structures. Its focus on vectorization minimizes the need for explicit loops and iterative operations, which are less efficient in pure Python.\n• Foundation for High-Level Libraries: Popular libraries in the field of machine learning and data science, such as Pandas, Matplotlib and Scikit-learn, are built on top of NumPy. Understanding NumPy provides a solid foundation for working with these advanced tools.\n• Applications in Diverse Fields: From physics and engineering to bioinformatics and finance, NumPy is used to perform data analysis and mathematical modeling in a multitude of disciplines.\n\nIn short, NumPy is not just another library in a data scientist’s arsenal; it is the backbone of scientific computing in Python, facilitating the analysis of complex data and the implementation of numerical algorithms.\n\nInstalling NumPy is a simple, but fundamental process to dive into the world of data analysis with Python.\n• If you don’t already have Python, install it from python.org. NumPy requires Python 3.6 or higher.\n• Open your terminal or command line and run the command or if you are installing it from your Jupiter Notebook or IPython Environments*. Pip is the Python package manager and will take care of downloading and installing NumPy for you.\n• To verify the installation, run . This should display the version of NumPy installed.\n\nLet’s see an example of what it would look like in cmd as well as in a .py or Jupiter Notebook document:\n\n👉🏻 At the Command Prompt (Terminal or Command Prompt)\n• This command does three things:\n• tells Python to execute the code that immediately follows.\n• If NumPy is installed correctly, you should see a version number, such as “1.19.2”, in the command output.\n• This code does the same as the command in the terminal, but directly in the Jupyter environment.\n• If NumPy is correctly installed, you will see the NumPy version displayed as output for that cell.\n• Virtual Environments: It is advisable to use virtual environments to manage the dependencies of your projects. Tools like or can create isolated environments with specific versions of Python and its libraries.\n• Regular Updates: Keep NumPy and your other libraries up to date to take advantage of enhancements and bug fixes.\n• Documentation: Familiarize yourself with the official NumPy documentation. It is an invaluable source of information and examples.\n\nNumPy introduces a powerful object: the ndarray (N-dimensional array). These arrays are collections of elements (usually numbers), all of the same type, indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers.\n\nYou can create NumPy arrays from Python lists using . For example:\n\nOther useful functions include , , and , that create arrays filled with zeros, ones, or a sequence of numbers, respectively.\n• NumPy arrays support mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. These operations are applied element by element.\n• For instance, if and are arrays of NumPy, will result in an array where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements in and .\n• NumPy also supports more complex operations such as scalar and cross product, trigonometric functions, logarithmic operations and more.\n\nThe power of NumPy lies in its simplicity to perform complex mathematical operations and its ability to efficiently handle large data sets. By using vectorized operations, NumPy eliminates the need for explicit loops in many situations, resulting in cleaner, more readable and, most importantly, faster code.\n• In addition to creating and performing operations, NumPy offers several ways to manipulate arrays. You can change the shape of an array with , transpose arrays with , and join or split arrays with functions such as , , , .\n• Indexing and slicing are powerful tools in NumPy. They allow you to access and modify elements, rows, columns and submatrices in very flexible ways.\n\nTo better understand how these operations work, here are some simple examples:\n\nNumPy goes far beyond basic operations, offering a vast array of advanced mathematical functions.
