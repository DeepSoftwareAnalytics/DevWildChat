        "document": "File handling is used to store data permanently in a computer. Using file handling we can store our data in secondary memory (Hard disk).\n\nHow to achieve the File Handling\n\nFor achieving file handling we need to follow the following steps:-\n\n STEP 1-Naming a file\n\n STEP 2-Opening a file\n\n STEP 3-Writing data into the file\n\n STEP 4-Reading data from the file\n\n STEP 5-Closing a file.\n\nWe give input to the executing program and the execution program gives back the output. The sequence of bytes given as input to the executing program and the sequence of bytes that comes as output from the executing program are called stream. In other words, streams are nothing but the flow of data in a sequence.\n\nThe input and output operation between the executing program and the devices like keyboard and monitor are known as “console I/O operation”. The input and output operation between the executing program and files are known as “disk I/O operation”.\n\nThe I/O system of C++ contains a set of classes which define the file handling methods. These include ifstream, ofstream and fstream classes. These classes are derived from fstream and from the corresponding iostream class. These classes, designed to manage the disk files, are declared in fstream and therefore we must include this file in any program that uses files. File handling is essential for data storage and retrieval in applications.\n• None This class is the base class for other classes in this class hierarchy.\n• None This class contains the necessary facilities that are used by all the other derived classes for input and output operations.\n• None This class is derived from the class ‘ios’.\n• None The extraction operator(>>) is overloaded in this class to handle input streams from files to the program execution.\n• None This class declares input functions such as get(), getline() and read().\n• None This class is derived from the class ‘ios’.\n• None The insertion operator(<<) is overloaded in this class to handle output streams to files from the program execution.\n• None This class declares output functions such as put() and write().\n• None This class contains a pointer which points to the buffer which is used to manage the input and output streams.\n• None This class provides operations common to the file streams. Serves as a base for fstream, ifstream and ofstream class.\n• None This class contains open() and close() function.\n• None It contains open() function with default input mode.\n• None Inherits the functions get(), getline(), read(), seekg() and tellg() functions from the istream.\n• None It contains open() function with default output mode.\n• None Inherits the functions put(), write(), seekp() and tellp() functions from the ostream.\n• None This class provides support for simultaneous input and output operations.\n• None Inherits all the functions from istream and ostream classes through iostream.\n• None Its purpose is to set the file buffers to read and write.\n• None We can also use file buffer member function to determine the length of the file. \n\n\n\nIn C++, files are mainly dealt by using three classes fstream, ifstream, ofstream available in fstream headerfile. \n\nofstream: Stream class to write on files \n\nifstream: Stream class to read from files \n\nfstream: Stream class to both read and write from/to files.\n\nNow the first step to open the particular file for read or write operation. We can open file by \n\n1. passing file name in constructor at the time of object creation \n\n2. using the open method\n\nBoth ios::app and ios::ate take us to the end of the file when it is opened. The difference between the two modes is that ios :: app allow us to add data to the end of the file only, while ios :: ate mode permits us add data or to modify the existing data anywhere in the file.\n\nProblem Statement : To read and write a File in C++. \n\nExamples:\n\nBelow is the implementation by using ifstream & ofstream classes.\n\nBelow is the implementation by using fstream class."

        "document": "Working with files typically forms a big part of our C++ projects. We often need to read data from and write data to locations on the user's file system.\n\nTo do this, we use file streams. As the name suggests, these are streams, so we'll be leaning heavily on what we learned in our previous chapter. File streams are direct children of and , so often we'll be using the exact same methods.\n\nThe standard library's implementation of file streams is available within the header:\n\nWe have three main options for creating file streams:\n• - An input stream, used for reading data from a file. This inherits from .\n• - An output stream, used for writing data to a file. This inherits from .\n• - A bidirectional stream, which allows us to both read and write data to the same file. This inherits from , which in turn inherits from both and\n\nIn this lesson, we’ll work mostly with the bidirectional object. We can construct it without any arguments:\n\nWe do not need to provide a path to a specific file during construction. Instead, we can connect our stream to a file in the underlying file system at any time using the method, and we close that connection using\n\nA file stream does not necessarily have a one-to-one mapping to a file. We can reuse the file stream for different files:\n\nBuilding on what we covered in the previous lesson, we can pass a object to :\n\nOr, we can pass a :\n\nWe can check if a file is open using the method:\n\nGenerally, we should not open a file until we need it. However, we do have the option to open the file at the same time we create the file stream. We can do this by passing a path to the constructor:\n\nIn addition to passing the path to the function or the file stream constructor, we can pass a second argument, specifying the open mode. Open modes define what we can do with our file, and how some of our operations behave.\n• - Allow input to be read from the file. This is enabled by default for input and bidirectional file streams\n• - Allows output to be written to the file. This is enabled by default for output and bidirectional file streams\n• (\"at end\") - move the input and output positions to the end of the file upon opening\n• (\"append\") - write operations are done at the end of the file, regardless of where the output position is\n• - open the file in binary mode. We cover binary streams in more detail later in the chapter\n• (\"truncate\") - when the file is opened, its existing contents are deleted\n• - if the file we’re opening already exists, throw an exception. In other systems, this sometimes is referred to as opening the file in \"exclusive mode\".\n\nThe flag was added in C++23 and is not yet supported on all compilers, but can be replicated in other ways. For example, we can check whether a file exists using the function, or the method on an .\n\nOpen modes are provided as the second argument to or as the second argument to the file stream constructor:\n\nOpen modes are a bitmask, so we can combine multiple modes using the operator:\n\nWe can combine open modes in dozens of different ways. Unfortunately, how these combinations interact is not always obvious. For example, if the file we’re trying to open doesn’t exist, it might get created, or it might not. It depends on the open modes we set.\n\nThe file will be created in the following scenarios:\n• Output mode ( ) is set, and input mode ( ) is not set. This is the default behavior of an output file stream. Therefore, if we a without passing any flags, will be set in isolation, and the file will be created if it doesn’t already exist.\n• Append mode ( ) or truncate mode ( ) is set, regardless of any other flags.\n\nAside from this, there are many more unintuitive behaviors and interactions between open modes. Some combinations will throw errors. Some combinations will work but behave in ways we weren't expecting. This is a common source of confusion and bugs.\n\nIn general, if your code is compiling but your file is not being written to or updated in the way we expect, the issue is almost always the combination of open modes we’ve selected.\n\nIt’s much too complex to memorize all the interactions - we can just look them up when needed. A full table of the interactions is available on a standard library reference, such as cppreference.com.\n\nFile streams have the same error-handling mechanisms as any other stream. We covered those in the previous chapter, and will talk about them in more detail a little later in this lesson,\n\nHowever, file streams have unique error scenarios we need to consider, caused by their interactions with the underlying filesystem.\n\nUsually, the first error we’ll want to check for when working with files is whether the file is open when we expect it to be.\n\nWe can do that with the method. In the following examples, we’re creating an error by trying to open a file that already exists, using the open mode.\n\nAs we covered in our lesson on output streams, we can use the method to cause our stream to throw exceptions when it encounters errors. The exception type will be a :\n\nThis exception has a and method, but they’re not especially useful in this scenario. When we want to find out what went wrong when accessing the file system, we usually need to talk to the operating system, and each system handles and reports errors differently.\n\nWe generally focus on portable code (ie, things that work across as many systems as possible), but we’ll briefly introduce some ways of working with system-specific issues here. For this example, we’ll assume our code is being built for Windows.\n\nBy including the header, we get access to some additional functions.\n\nThe function returns the error code of the last issue that occurred on the thread that called it:\n\nAll the Windows error codes are listed on the official Microsoft site.\n\nIn this example, the error code relates to a file already existing. We can use these error codes to have our code react appropriately to specific problems we anticipate might happen.\n\nThe standard library also provides access to an object that can help us with system errors. This can be accessed through the function from .\n\nThis object has a few useful utilities, including the ability to generate an error message from an operator-system-specific error code:\n\nOnce we’ve opened our file stream, we just use it like we would any other input and output stream. We covered input and output streams in detail here:\n\nThe rest of this lesson covers no new topics - it just shows examples of how the concepts covered in those lessons also work as we’d expect with file streams.\n\nWe write to files using the same methods we write to other output streams, such as the operator, the function, and the function:\n\nAfter running this code, we should have the file defined within containing the \"Hello World\" content.\n\nWe read from files in the same way we read from other input streams, using the operator, and methods such as and .\n\nThis program should print out the first line of the file we specified within our call:\n\nLike any other stream, file streams can have input and output positions. We use and to access and change the output position, whilst and work with the input position.\n\nWhen we call , the input and output positions are reset:\n\nAs with the streams we covered in previous lessons, file streams have internal states that we can use to check for errors.\n\nThey set , , and in the usual way, which we can check for directly using , or shorthand methods like and . Below, we read characters until our stream runs out of content:\n\nWe can also use the method, to cause our streams to once something goes wrong. In the following example, we’re trying to read from a file that has no content:\n\nTypically, the error codes and messages are not very descriptive:\n\nIf we need to understand the error, we must rely on OS-specific methods, as described in the previous section.\n\nFor example, on Windows, this specific scenario would generate a error code from .\n\nPassing this to the method of the object returned from yields the string: \"An attempt was made to move the file pointer before the beginning of the file.\"\n\nThe message is a little cryptic, but it means we tried to read content from our stream (using ) when the output position was outside the bounds of the file.\n\nThe following example shows how we can use file streams to create a rudimentary save/load feature.\n\nThe following class gives its objects the ability to save and load their state from a stream. Remember, file streams inherit from the basic stream types, so:\n• an is an\n• an is an\n• an is an , which is both an and an .\n\nOur functions accept references by the base type, as they do not need to be restricted to just working with file streams.\n\nOver in our main function, we check if a save file exists. If it does, we load our previous state; otherwise, we start from a clean slate.\n\nThe first time we run the program, we get this output:\n\nOn subsequent runs, we get this:\n\nThis process of converting our objects into forms that we can store on disk, or send across the internet, is called serialization.\n\nWe expand this concept to more complex use cases in the rest of this chapter.\n\nIn this lesson, we explored the fundamental aspects of file streams in C++, covering how to open, read, write, and handle files. We also delved into understanding the various file stream open modes, error handling techniques, and practical applications, enhancing your proficiency in managing file operations.\n• Learned the basics of file streams in C++ using , , and , and their inheritance from and .\n• Explored how to open and close file streams, and the versatility of file streams in handling multiple files.\n• Understood the different open modes ( , , , etc.) and their implications in file operations.\n• Gained insights into error handling in file streams, including the use of , , and system-specific error handling methods.\n• Discussed the concept of serialization and its application in saving and loading object states from files."

        "document": "My main question is, how do I implement it in the right way?\n\nFrom this declaration, I can deduce that the instance field is initiated on the heap. That means there is a memory allocation. What is completely unclear for me is when exactly the memory is going to be deallocated? Or is there a bug and memory leak? It seems like there is a problem with the implementation.\n\nRecently I've bumped into a realization/implementation of the Singleton design pattern for C++. It has looked like this (I have adopted it from the real-life example):\n\nWe went over this topic recently in my EECS class. If you want to look at the lecture notes in detail, visit http://umich.edu/~eecs381/lecture/IdiomsDesPattsCreational.pdf. These notes (and quotations I give in this answer) were created by my Professor, David Kieras. There are two ways that I know to create a Singleton class correctly. Implement it similar to the way you have it in your example. As for destruction, \"Singletons usually endure for the length of the program run; most OSs will recover memory and most other resources when a program terminates, so there is an argument for not worrying about this.\" However, it is good practice to clean up at program termination. Therefore, you can do this with an auxiliary static SingletonDestructor class and declare that as a friend in your Singleton. class Singleton { public: static Singleton* get_instance(); // disable copy/move -- this is a Singleton Singleton(const Singleton&) = delete; Singleton(Singleton&&) = delete; Singleton& operator=(const Singleton&) = delete; Singleton& operator=(Singleton&&) = delete; friend class Singleton_destroyer; private: Singleton(); // no one else can create one ~Singleton(); // prevent accidental deletion static Singleton* ptr; }; // auxiliary static object for destroying the memory of Singleton class Singleton_destroyer { public: ~Singleton_destroyer { delete Singleton::ptr; } }; // somewhere in code (Singleton.cpp is probably the best place) // create a global static Singleton_destroyer object Singleton_destoyer the_destroyer; The Singleton_destroyer will be created on program startup, and \"when program terminates, all global/static objects are destroyed by the runtime library shutdown code (inserted by the linker), so the_destroyer will be destroyed; its destructor will delete the Singleton, running its destructor.\" This is called the Meyers Singleton, created by C++ wizard Scott Meyers. Simply define get_instance() differently. Now you can also get rid of the pointer member variable. This is neat because the value returned is by reference and you can use syntax instead of to access member variables. \"Compiler automatically builds code that creates 's' first time through the declaration, not thereafter, and then deletes the static object at program termination.\" Note also that with the Meyers Singleton you \"can get into very difficult situation if objects rely on each other at the time of termination - when does the Singleton disappear relative to other objects? But for simple applications, this works fine.\"\n\nIt is indeed probably allocated from the heap, but without the sources there is no way of knowing. The typical implementation (taken from some code I have in emacs already) would be: ...and rely on the program going out of scope to clean up afterwards. If you work on a platform where cleanup must be done manually, I'd probably add a manual cleanup routine. Another issue with doing it this way is that it isn't thread-safe. In a multithreaded environment, two threads could get through the \"if\" before either has a chance to allocate the new instance (so both would). This still isn't too big of a deal if you are relying on program termination to clean up anyway.\n\nIn addition to the other discussion here, it may be worth noting that you can have global-ness, without limiting usage to one instance. For example, consider the case of reference counting something... struct Store{ std::array<Something, 1024> data; size_t get(size_t idx){ /* ... */ } void incr_ref(size_t idx){ /* ... */} void decr_ref(size_t idx){ /* ... */} }; template<Store* store_p> struct ItemRef{ size_t idx; auto get(){ return store_p->get(idx); }; ItemRef() { store_p->incr_ref(idx); }; ~ItemRef() { store_p->decr_ref(idx); }; }; Store store1_g; Store store2_g; // we don't restrict the number of global Store instances Now somewhere inside a function (such as ) you can do: The refs don't need to store a pointer back to their respective because that information is supplied at compile-time. You also don't have to worry about the 's lifetime because the compiler requires that it is global. If there is indeed only one instance of then there's no overhead in this approach; with more than one instance it's up to the compiler to be clever about code generation. If necessary, the class can even be made a of (you can have templated friends!). If itself is a templated class then things get messier, but it is still possible to use this method, perhaps by implementing a helper class with the following signature: The user can now create a type (and global instance) for each global instance, and always access the stores via their wrapper instance (thus forgetting about the gory details of the template parameters needed for using )."

        "document": "A singleton pattern is a design pattern that ensures that only one instance of a class can exist in the entire program. This means that if you try to create another instance of the class, it will return the same instance that was created earlier.\n\nImplementation of the Singleton Pattern In C++\n\nThe Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern in C++ that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is used when you want to control the instantiation of a class to ensure that there's a single instance throughout the lifetime of your application.\n\nBelow is an example implementation of the Singleton pattern in C++:\n\nBelow is the explanation of the above code:\n• None We have a Singleton class with a private constructor and a private destructor, ensuring that the class can only be instantiated and destroyed from within the class itself.\n• None The getInstance method is static and provides access to the single instance of the Singleton class. It uses lazy initialization, meaning it creates the instance only when getInstance is called for the first time. Subsequent calls return the existing instance.\n• None We delete the copy constructor and assignment operator to prevent copying of the Singleton instance, ensuring there's only one instance.\n• None In the main function, we demonstrate how to access and use the Singleton instance. Attempting to create another instance using the regular constructor is prevented because the constructor is private.\n\nDiagram explaining the Singleton Pattern in C++\n\nThe Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.\n• Singleton Class : This is the class that you want to make a singleton. It has a private constructor, private destructor, and a private static member variable to hold the single instance of the class.\n• Static Member Variable : This is a private static member variable within the Singleton class that holds the single instance of the class. It is usually initialized to nullptr or an instance of the class itself.\n• Static Method (getInstance) : A public static method within the Singleton class called getInstance. This method is responsible for creating the instance if it doesn't exist or returning the existing instance if it does. It ensures that there's only one instance of the class.\n• Delete Copy Constructor and Assignment Operator : To prevent copying of the Singleton instance, the copy constructor and assignment operator should be deleted within the Singleton class.\n\nAbove diagram of singleton pattern works as follows:\n• Initialization : The static member variable in the Singleton class is initialized to nullptr (or an instance of the class) when the program starts.\n• First Access (Lazy Initialization) : When the getInstance method is called for the first time, it checks if the static member variable is nullptr. If it is, it creates a new instance of the Singleton class using its private constructor. If it's not nullptr, it returns the existing instance.\n• Subsequent Accesses : For all subsequent calls to getInstance, the method simply returns the existing instance created during the first access.\n• Usage : Clients access the Singleton instance by calling getInstance() and can then use the methods and data members of the Singleton as needed.\n\nIn the diagram above, Singleton is the Singleton class, instance is the static member variable holding the single instance, and getInstance() is the static method responsible for managing access to that instance.\n\nAdvantages of the Singleton Pattern in C++ Design Patterns\n\nHere are the advantages of the Singleton pattern in C++:\n• Single Instance : The primary advantage of the Singleton pattern is that it ensures there is only one instance of a class in the entire application. This is especially useful when you want to control access to a resource or ensure a single point of control for a specific functionality.\n• Global Access : The Singleton instance is globally accessible throughout the application. This allows different parts of your code to access and manipulate the same instance, making it convenient for sharing data or functionality.\n• Lazy Initialization : The Singleton pattern often employs lazy initialization, meaning that the instance is created only when it is first needed. This can improve the application's startup time and memory efficiency because resources are allocated only when required.\n• Resource Management : Singletons can be used to manage shared resources, such as database connections, thread pools, configuration settings, or caching mechanisms. By controlling access to these resources through a Singleton, you can ensure efficient resource allocation and deallocation.\n• Reduced Memory Usage : Since there is only one instance of the Singleton class, it reduces memory usage compared to creating multiple instances of the same class.\n• Avoids Global Variables : Singleton provides a controlled way to have global access without resorting to global variables, which can be error-prone and difficult to manage.\n• Thread Safety : Singleton patterns can be implemented to provide thread safety, ensuring that the single instance is accessed safely in multi-threaded environments.\n• Easier Testing : Singleton instances can be easily replaced with mock objects or test doubles during unit testing, making it easier to isolate and test specific parts of your code.\n• Consistent State : Since there is only one instance, it ensures that the state of the Singleton remains consistent throughout the application's lifecycle.\n• Improved Code Organization : Singleton helps organize your code by providing a clear point of access for a specific functionality or resource. It enforces a structured way to interact with that functionality, making the codebase more maintainable.\n• Initialization Control : Singleton allows you to have control over when and how the instance is initialized, allowing you to perform any necessary setup or configuration before using the instance.\n\nDisadvantages of the Singleton Pattern in C++ Design Patterns\n\nHere are some of the disadvantages of using the Singleton pattern in C++:\n• Global State : One of the main drawbacks of the Singleton pattern is that it introduces a form of global state to your application. This means that the Singleton instance is accessible from anywhere in the code, which can lead to hidden dependencies and make it challenging to track and reason about the flow of data.\n• Tight Coupling : The Singleton pattern can create tight coupling between different parts of your codebase, as many parts of the application may rely on the Singleton instance. This can make it difficult to change or replace the Singleton class without affecting other components.\n• Testing Challenges : Testing can be more complex with Singleton classes. Since the Singleton instance is globally accessible, it can be challenging to isolate and test individual components in isolation. Unit tests may become dependent on the Singleton's state, making tests less predictable.\n• Limited Inheritance : Inheritance with a Singleton class can be problematic. If you want to derive a subclass from a Singleton, it may not work as expected because the Singleton pattern enforces a single instance of the base class. Subclassing may lead to unexpected behavior or violate the principle of a single instance.\n• Difficult to Mock : When testing, it can be challenging to mock or replace a Singleton instance with a test double. The Singleton pattern tightly binds your code to a specific instance, making it less flexible for testing purposes.\n• Concurrency Issues : If not implemented carefully, Singletons can introduce concurrency issues in multi-threaded applications. You may need to use synchronization mechanisms, like locks or mutexes, to ensure safe access to the Singleton instance, which can add complexity to your code.\n• Singleton Pattern Overuse: Due to its convenience, developers might overuse the Singleton pattern, leading to an abundance of Singleton instances in an application. This can defeat the purpose of the pattern and result in increased memory usage.\n• Initialization Overhead : Lazy initialization, while often an advantage, can introduce some overhead when the Singleton instance is first accessed. If the initialization process is resource-intensive, it can affect the application's startup time.\n• Difficulties in Debugging : Debugging a Singleton-based codebase can be challenging, especially when issues related to the Singleton's state arise. It can be hard to trace the source of problems when multiple parts of the code may have modified the Singleton's data.\n• Limited Dependency Injection : Using dependency injection and inversion of control becomes less straightforward when relying on Singleton instances. It may be challenging to inject alternative implementations or configurations because the Singleton instance is typically accessed globally.\n\nUses of the Singleton Pattern\n\nHere are some common use cases for the Singleton pattern in C++:\n• Logger : In a logging system, you might want to ensure that there's only one log file open at a time. A Singleton Logger class can manage the log file and provide a single point for logging messages from different parts of the application.\n• Database Connection Pool : When dealing with database connections, it's efficient to maintain a pool of connections that can be reused. A Singleton can manage the pool and provide a way to access and release connections.\n• Configuration Manager : A Singleton can be used to manage configuration settings for an application. It loads configuration data from a file or another source once and provides access to it throughout the application's lifecycle.\n• Cache Manager : In a caching system, you can use a Singleton Cache Manager to store frequently accessed data in memory. This can improve performance by reducing the need to retrieve data from a slower source, such as a database.\n• Thread Pool : For multi-threaded applications, you may want to create a fixed number of worker threads that can process tasks concurrently. A Singleton can manage the thread pool and distribute tasks to available threads.\n• User Authentication : In web applications, a Singleton User Authentication class can keep track of user sessions and ensure that user authentication is handled consistently across different parts of the application.\n• Game State Manager : In game development, a Singleton Game State Manager can maintain the current state of the game, such as the level being played, the score, and the player's progress.\n• Device Manager : When dealing with hardware devices like printers or cameras, a Singleton Device Manager can ensure that there's only one instance responsible for managing the devices and their interactions.\n• Resource Manager: In applications that use limited resources like licenses or tokens, a Singleton Resource Manager can control the allocation and deallocation of these resources.\n• HTTP Connection Pool : When making HTTP requests in a client application, a Singleton HTTP Connection Pool can manage and reuse HTTP connections to minimize overhead.\n• Game Scoreboard : In multiplayer online games, a Singleton Scoreboard can track and display the scores and rankings of players across different game sessions.\n• Event Dispatcher : In GUI applications, a Singleton Event Dispatcher can handle the distribution of user interface events, ensuring that events are processed consistently and in the correct order.\n• Print Spooler : In a printing system, a Singleton Print Spooler can manage the printing queue and ensure that print jobs are processed in a coordinated manner.\n\nThese are just a few examples of how the Singleton pattern can be applied to manage and control resources, state, and functionality in various types of applications. It provides a convenient way to ensure a single point of access and management for such scenarios."

        "document": "A singleton class is a special type of class in object-oriented programming which can have only one object or instance at a time. In other words, we can instantiate only one instance of the singleton class. The new variable also points to the initial instance created if we attempt to instantiate the Singleton class after the first time. This is implemented by using the core concepts of object-oriented programming namely access modifiers, constructors & static methods.\n\nSteps to Implement Singleton Class in C++:\n• None Make all the constructors of the class private.\n• None Delete the copy constructor of the class.\n• None Make a private static pointer that can point to the same class object (singleton class).\n• None Make a public static method that returns the pointer to the same class object (singleton class).\n\nBelow is the implementation of the singleton class in C++:\n• None Firstly, we made all the constructor private so that an instance of the Singleton class can’t be instantiated from outside of it.\n• None We deleted copy constructor so that copy of the instance cannot be created.\n• instancePtr and initialized it with NULL . It points to the instance of Singleton class.\n• getInstance() method which returns an instance of the Singleton class. It is a static method because static variables are accessed by only static methods and we have to access instancePtr\n• None If there already exists an instance of the Singleton class then getInstance() will return a pointer to that instance as we can have only one instance of the Singleton class.\n• instancePtr == NULL that means there exists no instance of the Singleton class. So, getInstance() will instantiate an instance of the Singleton class and return a pointer to it.\n• None We cannot create an instance of the Singleton class as all constructors are private. We have to use the getInstance() method to get an instance of it.\n\nCase 1: An instance of the Singleton Class is created beforehand.\n\nIn this implementation, we are creating an instance of the Singleton class beforehand (i.e. initializing instancePtr with an instance instead of NULL using a new keyword) and returning it when getInstance() is invoked.\n\nBelow is the C++ program to implement the above approach:\n• None Firstly, we made all the constructor private so that an instance of the Singleton class can’t be instantiated from outside of it.\n• None We deleted copy constructor so that copy of the instance cannot be created.\n• instancePtr and initialized it with an instance using the new keyword. It is pointing to the instance of the Singleton class.\n• getInstance() instancePtr of the Singleton class. It is a static method because static variables are accessed by only static methods and we have to access instancePtr\n• None We cannot create an instance of the Singleton class as all constructors are private. We have to use the getInstance() method to get an instance of it.\n\nCase 2: When the instance is created without using the getInstance() method to create the Singleton Class.\n\nBelow is the C++ program to implement the singleton class without using getinstance() method:\n\n// to the instance of this class. // If there is no instance of class // then we can create an instance. // the class already has an instance. // So, we are returning that instance // and not creating new one. // no method is used to access it.\n\nExplanation: As shown in the above output we are not able to instantiate an instance of the Singleton class by using the constructor. We can have only one instance of the Singleton class which we will get by using the getInstance() method."
