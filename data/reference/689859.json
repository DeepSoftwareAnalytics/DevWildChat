        "document": "The pywin32 package has been around for a very long time. In fact, the book that covers this topic was published in 2000 by Mark Hammond and Andy Robinson. Despite being 18 years old (which make me feel really old :), the underlying technology and concepts still work today. Pywin32 is basically a very thin wrapper of python that allows us to interact with COM objects and automate Windows applications with python. The power of this approach is that you can pretty much do anything that a Microsoft Application can do through python. The downside is that you have to run this on a Windows system with Microsoft Office installed. Before we go through some examples, make sure you have pywin32 installed on your system using or One other recommendation I would make is that you keep a link to Tim Golden’s page handy. This resource has many more details on how to use python on Windows for automation and other administration tasks.\n\nAll of these applications start with similar imports and process for activating an application. Here is a very short example of opening up Excel: Once you run this from the command line, you should see Excel open up. When you press ENTER, the application will close. There are a few key concepts to go through before we actually make this a more useful application. The first step is to import the win32 client. I’ve used the convention of importing it as to make the actual dispatch code a little shorter. The magic of this code is using to launch Excel. In this example, I use to create a static proxy. I recommend reading this article if you want to know more details about static vs. dynamic proxies. I have had good luck using this approach for the types of examples included in this article but will be honest - I have not widely experimented with the various dispatch approaches. Now that the excel object is launched, we need to explicitly make it visible by setting The win32 code is pretty smart and will close down excel once the program is done running. This means that if we just leave the code to run on its own, you probably won’t see Excel. I include the dummy prompt to keep Excel visible on the screen until the user presses ENTER. I include the final line of as a bit of a belt and suspenders approach. Strictly speaking win32 should close out Excel when the program is done but I decided to include to show how to force the application to close. This is the most basic approach to using COM. We can extend this in a number of more useful ways. The rest of this article will go through some examples that might be useful for your own needs.\n\nIn my day-to-day work, I frequently use pandas to analyze and manipulate data, then output the results in Excel. The next step in the process is to open up the Excel and review the results. In this example, we can automate the file opening process which can make it simpler than trying to navigate to the right directory and open a file. # Define the full path for the output file # In the real world, this would likely be much more involved # Open up Excel and make it visible This simple example expands on the earlier one by showing how to use the object to open up a file.\n\nAnother simple scenario where COM is helpful is when you want to attach a file to an email and send to a distribution list. This example shows how to do some data manipulation, open up a Outlook email, attach a file and leave it open for additional text before sending. # Define the full path for the output file # In the real world, this would likely be much more involved # The file needs to be a string not a path object This example gets a little more involved but the basic concepts are the same. We need to create our object (Outlook in this case) and create a new email. One of the challenging aspects of working with COM is that there is not a very consistent API. It is not intuitive that you create an email like this: It generally takes a little searching to figure out the exact API for the specific problem. Google and stackoverflow are your friends. Once the email object is created, you can add the recipient and CC list as well as attach the file. When it is all said and done, it looks like this: The email is open and you can add additional information and send it. In this example, I chose not to close out Outlook and let python handle those details.\n\nThe final example is the most involved but illustrates a powerful approach for blending the data analysis of python with the user interface of Excel. It is possible to build complex excel with pandas but that approach can be very laborious. An alternative approach would be to build up the complex file in Excel, then do the data manipulation and copy the data tab to the final Excel output. Here is an example of the Excel dashboard we want to create: Yes, I know that pie charts are awful but I can almost guarantee that someone is going to ask you to put one in the dashboard at some point in time! Also, this template had a pie chart and I decided to keep it in the final output instead of trying to figure out another chart. It might be helpful to take a step back and look at the basic process the code will follow: Let’s get started with the code. # Define the full path for the data file file # Define the full path for the final output file In the section we performed our imports, read in the data and defined all three files. Of note is that this process includes the step of summarizing the data with pandas and saving the data in an Excel file. We then re-open that file and copy the data into the template. It is a bit convoluted but this is the best approach I could figure out for this scenario. Next we perform the analysis and save the temp Excel file: # In the real world, this would likely be much more involved Now we use COM to merge the temp output file into our Excel dashboard tab and save a new copy: # Use com to copy the files around # Copy from the data file (select all data in A:D columns) # Must convert the path file object to a string for the save to work The code opens up Excel and makes sure it is not visible. Then it opens up the dashboard template and data files. It uses the to select all the data and then copies it into the template file. The final step is to save the template as a new file. This approach can be a very convenient shortcut when you have a situation where you want to use python for data manipulation but need a complex Excel output. You may not have an apparent need for it now but if you ever build up a complex Excel report, this approach is much simpler than trying to code the spreadsheet by hand with python.\n\nMy preference is to try to stick with python as much as possible for my day-to-day data analysis. However, it is important to know when other technologies can streamline the process or make the results have a bigger impact. Microsoft’s COM technology is a mature technology and can be used effectively through python to do tasks that might be too difficult to do otherwise. Hopefully this article has given you some ideas on how to incorporate this technique into your own workflow. If you have any tasks you like to use pywin32 for, let us know in the comments."

        "document": "Quick Start to Client side COM and Python\n\nThis documents how to quickly start using COM from Python. It is not a thorough discussion of the COM system, or of the concepts introduced by COM.\n\nOther good information on COM can be found in various conference tutorials - please see the collection of Mark's conference tutorials\n\nFor information on implementing COM objects using Python, please see a Quick Start to Server side COM and Python\n\nIn this document we discuss the following topics:\n• Using a COM object from Python\n• How do I know which objects are available?\n• Static Dispatch/Type Safe objects (using the new improved makepy.py)\n• Using COM Constants with makepy.\n\nTo use a COM object from Python\n\nAnd we will see the word \"Hello\" appear in the top cell.\n\nHow do I know which methods and properties are available?\n\nGood question. This is hard! You need to use the documentation with the products, or possibly a COM browser. Note however that COM browsers typically rely on these objects registering themselves in certain ways, and many objects to not do this. You are just expected to know.\n\nPythonCOM comes with a basic COM browser that may show you the information you need. Note that this package requires Pythonwin (ie, the MFC GUI environment) to be installed for this to work.\n\nThere are far better COM browsers available - I tend to use the one that comes with MSVC, or this one!\n\nTo run the browser, simply select it from the Pythonwin Tools menu, or double-click on the file win32com\\client\\combrowse.py\n\nIn the above examples, if we printed the ' ' object above, it would have resulted in\n\nThis reflects that the object is a generic COM object that Python has no special knowledge of (other than the name you used to create it!). This is known as a \"dynamic dispatch\" object, as all knowledge is built dynamically. The win32com package also has the concept of static dispatch objects, which gives Python up-front knowledge about the objects that it is working with (including arguments, argument types, etc)\n\nIn a nutshell, Static Dispatch involves the generation of a .py file that contains support for the specific object. For more overview information, please see the documentation references above.\n\nThe generation and management of the .py files is somewhat automatic, and involves one of 2 steps:\n• Using makepy.py to select a COM library. This process is very similar to Visual Basic, where you select from a list of all objects installed on your system, and once selected the objects are magically useable.\n• Use explicit code to check for, and possibly generate, support at run-time. This is very powerful, as it allows the developer to avoid ensuring the user has selected the appropriate type library. This option is extremely powerful for OCX users, as it allows Python code to sub-class an OCX control, but the actual sub-class can be generated at run-time. Use makepy.py with a -i option to see how to include this support in your Python code.\n\nThe win32com.client.gencache module manages these generated files. This module has some documentation of its own, but you probably don't need to know the gory details!\n\nHow do I get at the generated module?\n\nYou will notice that the generated file name is long and cryptic - obviously not designed for humans to work with! So how do you get at the module object for the generated code?\n\nHopefully, the answer is you shouldn't need to. All generated file support is generally available directly via win32com.client.Dispatch and win32com.client.constants. But should you ever really need the Python module object, the win32com.client.gencache module has functions specifically for this. The functions GetModuleForCLSID and GetModuleForProgID both return Python module objects that you can use in your code. See the docstrings in the gencache code for more details.\n• Run ' ' (eg, run it from the command window, or double-click on it) and a list will be presented. Select the Type Library ' '\n• From a command prompt, run the command ' ' (include the double quotes). This simply avoids the selection process.\n• If you desire, you can also use explicit code to generate it just before you need to use it at runtime. Run ' (include the double quotes) to see how to do this.\n\nAnd that is it! Nothing more needed. No special import statements needed! Now, you simply need say\n\nNote that now Python knows the explicit type of the object.\n\nMakepy automatically installs all generated constants from a type library in an object called win32com.clients.constants. You do not need to do anything special to make these constants work, other than create the object itself (ie, in the example above, the constants relating to Word would automatically be available after the \") statement\n\nFor example, immediately after executing the code above, you could execute the following:"

        "document": "When people discuss COM, they are often talking about only one side of COM—using automation objects. Automation objects are objects that expose a programmable interface that can be used by another program or environment. Examples of automation objects are Microsoft Office, the Netscape browser, or programs you write yourself in any language, such as Visual Basic, Python, Delphi, C++, and so forth.\n\nInformation about COM objects is stored in the Windows registry. Details about the object’s class are stored, so that when that particular object needs to be created, the correct class is located and used. Although the term “class” doesn’t refer to a Python (or C++) class, the concept is identical: the class defines the implementation, and the object is an instance of the class. Classes are registered with a unique (but complex) class ID (CLSID) and a friendly (but not guaranteed unique) program ID (ProgID). The CLSID is a globally unique identifier (GUID), as discussed later in this chapter, while the ProgID for an object is a short string that names the object and typically creates an instance of the object. For example, Microsoft Excel defines its ProgID as , Microsoft Word defines , and so forth.\n\nPython programs use the method to create COM objects from a ProgID or CLSID.

        "document": "The Python language was designed as a cross-platform language. Originally, however, it was difficult for developers to work with Windows-specific features such as its APIs, services or COM objects. In 1995, to remedy this problem, Australian developer Mark Hammond began work on a project called “Python for Windows Extensions”. Its aim was to enable Python developers to write scripts and applications for Windows more easily, by giving them access to all system features. This open-source project became “Win32All” in 1998, before becoming PyWin32 in 2000.\n\nPyWin32 is a Python extension for Windows systems, comprising a set of modules. It provides access to the low-level functionality of the Windows operating system, as well as to specific Windows features. Thanks to various bindings for Windows APIs, developers can write Python scripts to control and manipulate Windows elements. This includes processes, threads, windows, files, registries and services. In addition, PyWin32 includes modules for accessing functionalities such as ODBC databases, COM communication and Outlook mail servers. It can also manipulate Word, Excel and PowerPoint files. Initially named “Win32All”, the project was renamed PyWin32 in 2000. Since then, it has continued to evolve, thanks to numerous contributors from the open-source community. Several major updates have been released to support new Windows features. Today, this project is hosted on GitHub and managed by a team of volunteer developers. It is available under an open-source license, and can therefore be used free of charge and modified according to the needs of each user.\n\nOne of PyWin32’s main applications is the development of Windows applications. In particular, it is used to create graphical user interfaces using libraries such as the Win32 API and MFC. It also provides modules for manipulating Windows text and binary files, as well as Office software files such as Word, Excel and PowerPoint. These files can be created, modified or saved using Python scripts. Bindings for the various Windows APIs enable you to control and manipulate different aspects of the OS, such as processes, threads, registries and services. PyWin32 modules can also communicate with COM (Component Object Model) objects. These could be Microsoft Office applications or database servers, for example. Here again, Python scripts can be written to interact with COM objects from a Windows application. PyWin32 is also frequently used to automate system tasks. Examples include data backup, task scheduling, Windows service control and user account management. Scripts can be written to automate these common tasks.\n\nWhy use PyWin32 in Data Science? Unlike NumPy, Pandas or Scikit-learn, PyWin32 is not a Python library dedicated to Data Science. However, it can be used to write automation scripts and create data processing pipelines. It is used to access Windows data sources such as Excel or Microsoft Access files and SQL Server databases. Python developers can extract data from these sources and process it with Data Science libraries. In addition, PyWin32 can automate data processing tasks. These include import and export, format conversion and file merging. It is also possible to control the Windows user interface to automate tasks such as data entry or the selection of options in dialog windows. This is particularly useful when interacting with Windows applications.\n\nWhat are the alternatives to PyWin32? PyWin32 is not the only solution for accessing low-level Windows functionality with Python. Here are some of the most popular alternatives. Python for .NET is a Python extension for using the features of the .NET framework, including Windows Forms GUIs and web services. This provides access to Windows-specific and cross-platform functionality. For its part, ctypes is a Python library for calling functions from shared libraries (DLLs) with a syntax similar to C. Python developers can therefore use libraries written in other languages. The pywinnauto library automates the user interface with Python. It is particularly useful for testing Windows applications. With the comtypes library, developers can use COM (Component Object Model) interfaces with Python. This makes it possible to interact with Windows applications written in COM. Finally, ctypes-winform lets you use Windows Forms functions with a syntax similar to C#. This library is ideal for creating Windows user interfaces with Python.\n\nDepending on your development environment, there are different ways of installing PyWin32. First, make sure you have Python installed on your system and that your development environment is correctly configured. First, you can install it from source on the official GitHub page. In the directory where you extracted the zip file, open a command prompt and run the command “python setup.py install”. This will install PyWin32 in the Python environment. PyWin32 can also be installed using the Python pip package manager. Open a command prompt and run the command “pip install pywin32”. This command downloads and installs the latest version available from the PyPI (Python Package Index) repository. Finally, if you’re using Anaconda or Miniconda, you can install PyWin32 using the conda package manager. Open the command prompt and run the command “conda install pywin32”. This will download and install the latest version from the Anaconda repository.\n\nIn conclusion, PyWin32 is very useful for interacting with Windows and manipulating Office files via Python scripts. It can also communicate with COM objects and automate system tasks. It is therefore a valuable asset for developers of Windows applications in Python, Data Scientists and Data Engineers.
