        "document": "List comprehension is a way to create lists using a concise syntax. It allows us to generate a new list by applying an expression to each item in an existing iterable (such as a list or range). This helps us to write cleaner, more readable code compared to traditional looping techniques.\n\nFor example, if we have a list of integers and want to create a new list containing the square of each element, we can easily achieve this using list comprehension.\n• expression: The transformation or value to be included in the new list.\n• item: The current element taken from the iterable.\n• if condition (optional): A filtering condition that decides whether the current item should be included.\n\nThis syntax allows us to combine iteration, modification, and conditional filtering all in one line.\n\nThe main difference is that a for loop requires multiple lines to create a new list by iterating over items and manually adding each one. Whereas, list comprehension do the same task in a single line, this makes the code simpler and easier to read.\n\nExample: Let’s take an example, where we want to double each number of given list into a new list\n\nExplanation: Create an empty list ‘res‘ to store results and iterate over each element in list ‘a‘ and for each items in list ‘a‘, multiply it by 2 and append it to ‘res‘ using append() method.\n\nExplanation: In the above list comprehension, the iterable is a list ‘a’, and the expression is val * 2, which multiplies each value from the list by 2.\n\nList comprehensions can include conditional statements to filter or modify items based on specific criteria. These conditionals help us create customized lists quickly and making the code cleaner and more efficient.\n\nExample: Suppose we want to filter all even list from the given list.\n\nTo learn more about filtering conditions in list comprehensions, please refer to “Python List Comprehension Using If-Else“\n\nA simple example is creating a list of numbers from 0 to 9.\n\nList comprehension can also be used with nested loops. Here, we generate a list of coordinate pairs for a simple 3×3 grid.\n\nSuppose we have a list of lists and we want to convert it into a single list.\n\nExplanation: The line [val for row in mat for val in row] uses nested list comprehension to iterate through each row in mat. For each row, it iterates through each val in that row and collecting all values into a single list."

You use a list comprehension to transform and filter elements from an iterable efficiently. It allows you to replace complex loops and functions with more readable and often faster expressions. By understanding list comprehensions, you can optimize your code for better performance and clarity.\n\nBy the end of this tutorial, you’ll understand that:\n• A list comprehension in Python is a tool for creating lists by iterating over an iterable and optionally applying a condition.\n• You should use list comprehensions instead of loops when you want concise, readable code that performs transformations or filtering.\n• You add conditional logic to a list comprehension by including an statement within the comprehension.\n• A list comprehension can be faster than a loop because it’s optimized for performance by Python’s internal mechanisms.\n• A Python list comprehension is not lazy—it generates and stores the entire list in memory eagerly.\n• The difference between list comprehensions and is that the former creates a list, while the latter returns a object, which is iterable.\n\nIn this tutorial, you’ll explore how to leverage list comprehensions to simplify your code. You’ll also gain an understanding of the trade-offs that come with using them so that you can determine when other approaches are preferable.\n\nThere are a few different ways to create and add items to a lists in Python. In this section, you’ll explore loops and the function to perform these tasks. Then, you’ll move on to learn about how to use list comprehensions and when list comprehensions can benefit your Python program. The most common type of loop is the loop. You can use a loop to create a list of elements in three steps:\n• Loop over an iterable or range of elements.\n• Append each element to the end of the list. If you want to create a list containing the first ten perfect squares, then you can complete these steps in three lines of code: Here, you instantiate an empty list, . Then, you use a loop to iterate over . Finally, you multiply each number by itself and append the result to the end of the list. For an alternative approach that’s based in functional programming, you can use . You pass in a function and an iterable, and will create an object. This object contains the result that you’d get from running each iterable element through the supplied function. As an example, consider a situation in which you need to calculate the price after tax for a list of transactions: Here, you have an iterable, , and a function, . You pass both of these arguments to and store the resulting object in . Finally, you convert into a list using . List comprehensions are a third way of making or transforming lists. With this elegant approach, you could rewrite the loop from the first example in just a single line of code: Rather than creating an empty list and adding each element to the end, you simply define the list and its contents at the same time by following this format: Every list comprehension in Python includes three elements:\n• is the member itself, a call to a method, or any other valid expression that returns a value. In the example above, the expression is the square of the member value.\n• is the object or value in the list or iterable. In the example above, the member value is .\n• is a list, set, sequence, generator, or any other object that can return its elements one at a time. In the example above, the iterable is . Because the expression requirement is so flexible, a list comprehension in Python works well in many places where you would use . You can rewrite the pricing example with its own list comprehension: The only distinction between this implementation and is that the list comprehension in Python returns a list, not a map object.\n\nOne benefit of using a list comprehension in Python is that it’s a single tool that you can use in many different situations. In addition to standard list creation, list comprehensions can also be used for mapping and filtering. In this section, you’ll find advanced techniques to work with list comprehensions in Python. The most common way to add conditional logic to a list comprehension is to add a conditional to the end of the expression. Earlier, you saw this formula for how to create list comprehensions: While this formula is accurate, it’s also a bit incomplete. A more complete description of the comprehension formula adds support for optional conditionals. Here, your conditional statement comes just before the closing bracket: Conditionals are important because they allow list comprehensions to filter out unwanted values, which would normally require a call to : \"the rocket came back from mars\" In this code block, the conditional statement filters out any characters in that aren’t vowels. The conditional can test any valid expression. If you need a more complex filter, then you can even move the conditional logic to a separate function: \"The rocket, who was named Ted, came back \" \"from Mars because he missed his friends.\" Here, you create a complex filter, , and pass this function as the conditional statement for your list comprehension. Note that you also pass the member value as an argument to your function. You can place the conditional at the end of the statement for basic filtering, but what if you want to change a member value instead of filtering it out? In this case, it’s useful to place the conditional near the beginning of the expression. You can do so by taking advantage of the conditional expression: By placing the conditional logic at the beginning of a list comprehension, you can use conditional logic to select from multiple possible output options. For example, if you have a list of prices, then you may want to replace negative prices with and leave the positive values unchanged: Here, your expression is a conditional expression, . This tells Python to output the value of if the number is positive, but to use if the number is negative. If this seems overwhelming, then it may be helpful to view the conditional logic as its own function: Now, your conditional expression is contained within , and you can use it as part of your list comprehension. While the list comprehension in Python is a common tool, you can also create set and dictionary comprehensions. A set comprehension is almost exactly the same as a list comprehension in Python. The difference is that set comprehensions make sure the output contains no duplicates. You can create a set comprehension by using curly braces instead of brackets: Your set comprehension outputs all the unique vowels that it found in . Unlike lists, sets don’t guarantee that items will be saved in any particular order. This is why the first member of the set is , even though the first vowel in is . Dictionary comprehensions are similar, with the additional requirement of defining a key: To create the dictionary, you use curly braces ( ) as well as a key-value pair ( ) in your expression. Python 3.8 introduced the assignment expression, also known as the walrus operator. To understand how you can use it, consider the following example. Say you need to make ten requests to an API that will return temperature data. You only want to return results that are greater than 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Assume that each request will return different data. In this case, the formula expression for member in iterable if conditional provides no way for the conditional to assign data to a variable that the expression can access. You need the temperature in both the expression and the conditional so this is a challenge. The walrus operator ( ) solves this problem. It allows you to run an expression while simultaneously assigning the output value to a variable. The following example shows how this is possible, using to generate fake weather data: Note that the walrus operator needs to be in the conditional part of your comprehension. You won’t often need to use the assignment expression inside of a list comprehension in Python, but it’s a useful tool to have at your disposal when necessary.\n\nDeciding When Not to Use a List Comprehension List comprehensions are useful and can help you write elegant code that’s easy to read and debug, but they’re not the right choice for all circumstances. They might make your code run more slowly or use more memory. If your code is less performant or harder to understand, then it’s probably better to choose an alternative. You can nest comprehensions to create combinations of lists, dictionaries, and sets within a collection. For example, say a climate laboratory is tracking the high temperature in five different cities for the first week of June. The perfect data structure for storing this data could be a Python list nested within a dictionary. You can create the data using nested comprehensions: You create the outer dictionary with a dictionary comprehension. The expression is a key-value pair that contains yet another comprehension. This code will quickly generate a list of data for each city in . Nested lists are a common way to create matrices, which you’ll often use for mathematical purposes. Take a look at the code block below: The outer list comprehension creates six rows, while the inner list comprehension fills each of these rows with values. So far, the purpose of each nested comprehension is pretty intuitive. However, there are other situations, such as flattening lists, where the logic arguably makes your code more confusing. Take this example, which uses a nested list comprehension to flatten a matrix: The code to flatten the matrix is concise, but it may not be so intuitive to understand how it works. On the other hand, if you used loops to flatten the same matrix, then your code would be much more straightforward to understand: Now you can see that the code traverses one row of the matrix at a time, pulling out all the elements in that row before moving on to the next one. A list comprehension in Python works by loading the entire output list into memory. For small or even medium-sized lists, this is generally fine. If you want to sum the squares of the first one-thousand integers, then a list comprehension will solve this problem admirably: But what if you wanted to sum the squares of the first billion integers? If you tried that on your machine, then your computer might become unresponsive. That’s because Python is trying to create a list with one billion integers, which consumes more memory than your computer would like. If you tried to do it anyway, then your machine could slow down or even crash. When the size of a list becomes problematic, it’s often helpful to use a generator instead of a list comprehension in Python. A generator doesn’t create a single, large data structure in memory, but instead returns an iterable. Your code can ask for the next value from the iterable as many times as necessary or until you’ve reached the end of your sequence, while only storing a single value at a time. If you sum the first billion squares with a generator, then your program will likely run for a while, but it shouldn’t cause your computer to freeze. In the example below, you use a generator: You can tell this is a generator because the expression isn’t inside brackets or curly braces. Optionally, generators can be inside parentheses. The example above still requires a lot of work, but it performs the operations lazily. Because of lazy evaluation, your code only calculates values when they’re explicitly requested. After the generator yields a value, it can add that value to the running sum, then discard that value and generate the next value. When the function requests the next value, the cycle starts over. This process keeps the memory footprint small. The function also operates lazily, meaning memory won’t be an issue if you choose to use it in this case: It’s up to you whether you prefer the generator expression or . So, which approach is faster? Should you use list comprehensions or one of their alternatives? Rather than adhere to a single rule that’s true in all cases, it’s more useful to ask yourself whether or not performance matters in your specific circumstance. If not, then it’s usually best to choose whatever approach leads to the cleanest code! If you’re in a scenario where performance is important, then it’s typically best to profile different approaches and listen to the data. The library is useful for timing how long it takes chunks of code to run. You can use to compare the runtime of , loops, and list comprehensions: Here, you define three methods that each use a different approach for creating a list. Then, you tell to run each of those functions 100 times each, and returns the total time it took to run those 100 executions. As your code demonstrates, the biggest difference is between the loop-based approach and , with the loop taking 50 percent longer to execute. Whether or not this matters depends on the needs of your application.\n\nIn this tutorial, you learned how to use a list comprehension in Python to accomplish complex tasks without making your code overly complicated. Whenever you have to choose a list creation method, try multiple implementations and consider what’s most convenient to read and understand in your specific scenario. If performance is important, then you can use profiling tools to give you actionable data instead of relying on hunches or guesses about what works the best.\n• Determine when code clarity or performance dictates an alternative approach Remember that while Python list comprehensions get a lot of attention, your intuition and ability to use data when it counts will help you write clean code that serves the task at hand.

In this article, we will discuss about 5 ways to format a string.\n\nYou will learn different methods of string formatting with examples for better understanding. Let’s look at them now!\n\nHow to Format Strings in Python\n\nThere are five different ways to perform string formatting in Python\n\nSo we will see the entirety of the above-mentioned ways, and we will also focus on which string formatting strategy is the best.\n\n1. How to Format String using % Operator\n\nIt is the oldest method of string formatting. Here we use the modulo % operator. The modulo % is also known as the “string-formatting operator”.\n\nIn the expression “The mangy, scrawny stray dog %s gobbled down” % ‘hurriedly’, the %s placeholder within the string is replaced by the value ‘hurriedly’.\n\nHere we are inserting multiple strings with the % operator.\n\nFloating-point numbers use the format %a.bf. Here, a would be the minimum number of digits to be present in the string; these might be padded with white space if the whole number doesn’t have this many digits.\n\nClose to this, bf represents how many digits are to be displayed after the decimal point.\n\nIn this code, the string ‘The value of pi is: %5.4f’ contains a format specifier %5.4f. The %5.4f format specifier is used to format a floating-point number with a minimum width of 5 and a precision of 4 decimal places.\n\nIn the given code, the formatting string Python is converted to Integer and floating point with %d,%f.\n\nNote: To know more about %-formatting, refer to String Formatting in Python using %\n\n2. How to Format String using format() Method\n\nFormat() method was introduced with Python3 for handling complex string formatting more efficiently.\n\nFormatters work by putting in one or more replacement fields and placeholders defined by a pair of curly braces { } into a string and calling the str.format(). The value we wish to put into the placeholders and concatenate with the string passed as parameters into the format function.\n\nThis code is using {} as a placeholder and then we have called.format() method on the ‘equal’ to the placeholder.\n\nIn this code, curly braces {} with indices are used within the string ‘{2} {1} {0}’ to indicate the positions where the corresponding values will be placed.\n\nIn this code, curly braces {} with named placeholders ({a}, {b}, {c}) are used within the string ‘a: {a}, b: {b}, c: {c}’ to indicate the positions where the corresponding named arguments will be placed.\n\nIn this code, curly braces {} with named placeholders ({p}) are used within the string ‘The first {p} was alright, but the {p} {p} was tough.’ to indicate the positions where the corresponding named argument p will be placed.\n\nBoth the codes are doing string formatting. The first String is formatted with ‘%’ and the second String is formatted with .format().\n\nNote: To know more about str.format(), refer to format() function in Python\n\nPEP 498 introduced a new string formatting mechanism known as Literal String Interpolation or more commonly as F-strings (because of the leading f character preceding the string literal). The idea behind f-String in Python is to make string interpolation simpler.\n\nTo create an f-string in Python, prefix the string with the letter “f”. The string itself can be formatted in much the same way that you would with str. format(). F-strings provide a concise and convenient way to embed Python expressions inside string literals for formatting.\n\nIn this code, the f-string f”My name is {name}.” is used to interpolate the value of the name variable into the string.\n\nThis new formatting syntax is very powerful and easy. You can also insert arbitrary Python expressions and you can even do arithmetic operations in it.\n\nIn this code, the f-string f” He said his age is {2 * (a + b)}.” is used to interpolate the result of the expression 2 * (a + b) into the string.\n\nWe can also use lambda expressions in f-string formatting.\n\nIn this code, an anonymous lambda function is defined using lambda x: x*2. This lambda function takes an argument x and returns its double.\n\nIn this code, f-string formatting is used to interpolate the value of the num variable into the string.\n\nNote: To know more about f-strings, refer to f-strings in Python\n\nIn the String module, Template Class allows us to create simplified syntax for output specification. The format uses placeholder names formed by $ with valid Python identifiers (alphanumeric characters and underscores). Surrounding the placeholder with braces allows it to be followed by more alphanumeric letters with no intervening spaces. Writing $$ creates a single escaped $:\n\nThis code imports the Template class from the string module. The Template class allows us to create a template string with placeholders that can be substituted with actual values. Here we are substituting the values n1 and n2 in place of n3 and n4 in the string n.\n\nNote: To know more about the String Template class, refer to String Template Class in Python\n\n5. How to Format String using center() Method\n\nThe center() method is a built-in method in Python’s str class that returns a new string that is centered within a string of a specified width.\n\nThis code returns a new string padded with spaces on the left and right sides.\n\nf-strings are faster and better than both %-formatting and str.format(). f-strings expressions are evaluated at runtime, and we can also embed expressions inside f-string, using a very simple and easy syntax.\n\nThe expressions inside the braces are evaluated in runtime and then put together with the string part of the f-string and then the final string is returned.\n\nNote: Use Template String if the string is a user-supplied string Else Use f-Strings if you are on Python 3.6+, and. format() method if you are not.\n\nWe have covered all 5 ways of string formatting in Python. There are many use cases and examples for each method. We also compared these methods to find which one is most efficient to use in real-life projects.\n• How to use string formatters in Python\n• How to format a string using a dictionary in Python\n\nHow Do You Format Strings in Python?\n\nWhat is %s and %d in Python?\n\nWhat Does Mean in Python?\n\nHow to Use += in Python?\n\nWhat is \\t in Python?"
