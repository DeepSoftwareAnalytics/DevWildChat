        "document": "File handling is used to store data permanently in a computer. Using file handling we can store our data in secondary memory (Hard disk).\n\nHow to achieve the File Handling\n\nFor achieving file handling we need to follow the following steps:-\n\n STEP 1-Naming a file\n\n STEP 2-Opening a file\n\n STEP 3-Writing data into the file\n\n STEP 4-Reading data from the file\n\n STEP 5-Closing a file.\n\nWe give input to the executing program and the execution program gives back the output. The sequence of bytes given as input to the executing program and the sequence of bytes that comes as output from the executing program are called stream. In other words, streams are nothing but the flow of data in a sequence.\n\nThe input and output operation between the executing program and the devices like keyboard and monitor are known as “console I/O operation”. The input and output operation between the executing program and files are known as “disk I/O operation”.\n\nThe I/O system of C++ contains a set of classes which define the file handling methods. These include ifstream, ofstream and fstream classes. These classes are derived from fstream and from the corresponding iostream class. These classes, designed to manage the disk files, are declared in fstream and therefore we must include this file in any program that uses files. File handling is essential for data storage and retrieval in applications.\n• None This class is the base class for other classes in this class hierarchy.\n• None This class contains the necessary facilities that are used by all the other derived classes for input and output operations.\n• None This class is derived from the class ‘ios’.\n• None The extraction operator(>>) is overloaded in this class to handle input streams from files to the program execution.\n• None This class declares input functions such as get(), getline() and read().\n• None This class is derived from the class ‘ios’.\n• None The insertion operator(<<) is overloaded in this class to handle output streams to files from the program execution.\n• None This class declares output functions such as put() and write().\n• None This class contains a pointer which points to the buffer which is used to manage the input and output streams.\n• None This class provides operations common to the file streams. Serves as a base for fstream, ifstream and ofstream class.\n• None This class contains open() and close() function.\n• None It contains open() function with default input mode.\n• None Inherits the functions get(), getline(), read(), seekg() and tellg() functions from the istream.\n• None It contains open() function with default output mode.\n• None Inherits the functions put(), write(), seekp() and tellp() functions from the ostream.\n• None This class provides support for simultaneous input and output operations.\n• None Inherits all the functions from istream and ostream classes through iostream.\n• None Its purpose is to set the file buffers to read and write.\n• None We can also use file buffer member function to determine the length of the file. \n\n\n\nIn C++, files are mainly dealt by using three classes fstream, ifstream, ofstream available in fstream headerfile. \n\nofstream: Stream class to write on files \n\nifstream: Stream class to read from files \n\nfstream: Stream class to both read and write from/to files.\n\nNow the first step to open the particular file for read or write operation. We can open file by \n\n1. passing file name in constructor at the time of object creation \n\n2. using the open method\n\nBoth ios::app and ios::ate take us to the end of the file when it is opened. The difference between the two modes is that ios :: app allow us to add data to the end of the file only, while ios :: ate mode permits us add data or to modify the existing data anywhere in the file.\n\nProblem Statement : To read and write a File in C++. \n\nExamples:\n\nBelow is the implementation by using ifstream & ofstream classes.\n\nBelow is the implementation by using fstream class."

        "document": "C++ Structures are user defined data types which are used to store group of items of different data types. A structure creates a data type that can be used to group items of possibly different types into a single type.\n\nBefore using structure, we have to first define the structure. The struct keyword is used to define a structure as shown:\n\nwhere structure name is name and mem1, mem2 and mem3 are the items it groups. They are also called its members or fields.\n\nThe above is also called Structure Definition. It is not allocated any memory and cannot be used in the program directly. We have to create its variables to use it.\n\nOnce the structure is defined, its variable can be created in a similar way as basic data type variables.\n\nwhere struct_name is the name of the structure and var_name is the name of the variable.\n\nA variable can also be declared with the definition of the structure:\n\nStructure members cannot be initialized with declaration. For example, the following C++ program fails in compilation.\n\nStructure members can be initialized to values provided in the curly braces ‘{}’. For example,\n\nThe values provided in the curly braces {} are sequentially assigned to the members of the structure. In the above example, 0 is assigned to member x, and 1 is assigned to member y.\n\nSince C++ 20, we can also use Designated Initializers to initialize the structure members.\n\nStructure members are accessed using dot operator (.) as shown:\n\nwhere var_name is structure variable and member_name is the name of the structure member. A new value to this member can also be assigned using assignment operator.\n\nThe new value should be of the same type to avoid type mismatch error.\n\nIn C structures, functions were not allowed inside the structure but in C++, we can declare the function inside the structure. They are called member functions while the variables are called data members. C++ structure is way more similar to C++ classes as compared to C structures.\n\nC++ structures also support other class components such as constructor, destructor, access specifiers, etc.\n\nThe size of a structure is determined by the sum of the sizes of its individual data members, with additional padding added by the compiler to ensure proper memory alignment.\n\nIdeally, the size should be the size of all data members i.e. sizeof(char) + 2 * sizeof(int) = 1 + 8 = 9 bytes. But the size comes out to be 12 bytes. This is due to the mentioned structure padding.\n\nIn C++, typedef is used to create an alias for an existing variable. Similarly, with structures, typedef creates an alias for the original name of the structure.\n\nNested structure in C++ refers to a structure that is defined inside another structure. Just as structure members are declared within a structure, one structure can be declared as a member inside another structure.\n\nNotice how there are one more curly braces added in the initialization. This is to initialize the inner structure.\n\nThe inner structure can also be defined directly inside the outer structure even without naming the structure and just by creating a variable name.\n\nIn C++, a pointer to a structure is also known as a structure pointer. It is a pointer that holds the address of the memory location where the structure is stored. The normal way to access structure members is to first dereference the pointer and then use dot operator, but C++ provides –> arrow operator to directly access structure members using pointer to it.\n\nSelf-referential structures are those structures that contains the pointer to the same type as a member. For example,\n\nSuch kind of structures are used in data structures such as linked list, trees, etc.\n\nStructures work similarly like other variables with functions. We can pass a structure to a function or return a structure from a function, just like with other variables. Additionally, we can pass a structure either by value or by reference. However, the recommended approach is to pass a structure by reference, as making a copy of a structure is a costly operation.\n\nStructures are also used return multiple values from the function. Refer to the article to know more – Structure with Functions\n\nBit fields in structures allows us to define the number of bits that a particular data member will occupy. Basically, it specifies the manual size of the structure member in bits. It is useful in memory critical applications such as embedded systems.\n\nIn C++, a structure works similarly to a class, but there are some key differences in between of them. The important difference is how implementation details are handled.\n\nHow is a structure different from a class in C++?\n\nCan a structure have functions in C++?\n\nCan we assign one structure variable to another in C++?\n\nWhat is a structure tag in C++?\n\nHow do you access members of a structure in C++?"

Erasing them or summing their counts is easy then (runtime is more complicated here).\n\nIf you want to gain extra credit, it will pay to understand the limitations of asymptotic runtimes. Consider these points:\n\nWhat these asymptotic runtimes mean in practice depends a lot on the usage pattern. If no duplicates are ever inserted, we are at , but you can also get arbitrarily good times (in terms of = number of insertions) if there are lots of identical elements (for example, if each key has values then ). In the extreme case that all involved integers are the same, all operations are .\n\nAs an interviewee, I would also talk about whether these asymptotic runtimes are meaningful in practice. It may be that the map's tree structure (which is toxic for the cache and branch predictor) loses to a simple (if erasure is always in bulk) or even a (if the keys are \"dense\") for the given application.\n\nI think your main mistake (and why you were rejected) is not realizing that there is no need to store each inserted integer separately. You unfortunately also seem to have missed the possibility of keeping the list sorted, but I don't see where the comes from."

It is part of the Standard Template Library (STL), specifically within the header. This class essentially treats a string as a stream, allowing us to perform input and output operations on it, much like we would with and . Let's explore the uses, benefits, and methods associated with .\n\nis a stream class that operates on strings, implementing input/output operations on memory-based streams. It is particularly useful for parsing inputs and converting between strings and numeric types. The class is derived from the class, inheriting its stream capabilities. Here’s a brief overview of commonly used methods and operators with :\n• Method : Gets and sets the contents of the underlying string device object.\n\nTo create a object, you must include the header and instantiate a object. Once you have a object, you can use it to perform various operations, such as inserting data into the stream or extracting data from it. Here’s an example of creating a and inserting an integer into it: std::cout << \"The number as a string is: \" << str << std::endl;\n\n return 0;\n\n} In this example, we insert an integer ( ) into the object ( ) using the operator. Then, we extract the string representation of the number using the operator and store it in a variable . Finally, we print the string to the console.\n\nis often used to parse structured text input. For instance, if you have a CSV line with comma-separated values, you could use to split the line into separate fields: In this function, we use with a custom delimiter to split the line into fields, which we add to a vector. can also be used to build complex strings with formatting. Instead of concatenating strings manually, which can be inefficient, you can use to construct a string in a streamlined manner: void formatMessage(const std::string& name, int age) {\n\n std::stringstream ss;\n\n ss << \"Hello, \" << name << \". You are \" << age << \" years old.\";\n\n std::cout << ss.str() << std::endl;\n\n} In this function, we build a personalized greeting message using the operator to append strings and variables through the .\n\nWhen Not to Use While is a convenient tool for string manipulation, it may not always be the best choice. For simple string concatenation or when performance is critical, using native string operations or string literals might be more efficient. Additionally, when dealing with large amounts of data, consider the overhead of streaming operations versus direct manipulations.\n\noffers a flexible way to manipulate strings in C++. Its ability to treat strings as streams allows for intuitive and readable code when performing complex string manipulations. Whether you're parsing CSV files, building dynamic messages, or converting between string and numeric types, is a valuable asset in any C++ programmer's toolkit. By leveraging , you can write cleaner, more maintainable code and handle string-related tasks with ease.

How do I remove the number when the length of number is unknown or should I find out length of number and then use str.substr() to create a new String Stream ? Any other better method for doing it using C++ STL String and SStream would be really appreciated."

        "document": "stringstream in C++ and its Applications\n\nA stringstream associates a string object with a stream allowing you to read from the string as if it were a stream (like cin). To use stringstream, we need to include sstream header file. The stringstream class is extremely useful in parsing input.\n• str()- To get and set string object whose content is present in the stream.\n• operator >>- Read something from the stringstream object.\n\n1. Count the number of words in a string\n\nBelow is the C++ program to implement the above approach-\n\nTime complexity: O(n), Where n is the length of the string.\n\nAuxiliary space: O(m), Where m is the number of words in the string.\n\nBelow is the C++ program to implement the above approach-\n\nTime complexity: O(n log(k)), n is the total number of words in the input string, and k is the number of unique words.\n\nAuxiliary space: O(n).\n\nSince, the insertion and extraction operators of string stream work with different data types. So that’s why it works well with integers.\n\nWe will insert an integer into the string stream and after extracting that into a string, that integer value will become a string.\n\nRemoving spaces from a string using Stringstream\n\nConverting Strings to Numbers in C/C++"
