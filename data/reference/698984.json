        "document": "I am trying to paste data from the clipboard into an excel file. Get From Clipboard works perfectly fine when i copy string data and write it into notepad but when i am trying to get from clipboard and store the data in data-table variable and use write range activity, it gives me an error as “Object reference set to an instance …”. Can you please help me with this…?\n\nHi,\n\n Use string variable to store output result in “Get From Clipboard” activity.\n\n Use excel application scope to open the excel file in which you want to paste data by providing the complete path of excel file.\n\n Inside Do use write cell activity and provide sheet name and cell value where you want to paste the data.\n\n In value property give the string variable name given earlier.\n\n@Inzmamul_Haq, This error suggest that your Datatable variable is null. I believe problem is not with getting data from clipboad. Rather problem is with value assignment. Usually you get this error while accessing property of null variable.\n\nI guess this is what you wanted to Perform,\n\n But if you’re Trying to Copy a Datatable using Ctrl+C and Trying to Get it as a Datatable in UiPath, I’m afraid that is not the way to do it. There are methods Like Data Scraping if you’re Looking for that kind of Solution. And Please take into consideration what @Madhavi has described\n\n@Inzmamul_Haq Yes, That Appears in that way, Is there any Specific reason you’re using Get From ClipboardActivity?, If you’re trying to Copy the Data in one File to another Excel File, There are simpler methods to be used Instead of Performing a Copy Paste. You can Read the Data using Read Range Activity, Get Output as Datatable\n\n Write that Datatable to a New File using Write Range Activtiy"

        "document": "Hi. I have used the Copy selected Text function to take a value from a Windows application and then the Get from Clipboard function to get the value. How do I assign the value to a variable.\n\nget from clipboard activity will allow us to assign the value to a variable.\n\nDepending on your scenario, you specify a variable with a suitable datatype to hold what you are getting from the clipboard. For example, you have some text data in clipboard and you need to get it to your workflow, you can specify a String type variable there…\n\nThanks for your answer!\n\n I’m trying with an array of strings, but it’s not working.\n\n Have you seen any sample for an array?\n\nPlease use a simple string variable as the data retrieved by the Get Clipboard text will only have String values.\n\n You can then apply string manipulation functions such as ‘Split’ to get an array of strings out of the text retrieved."
