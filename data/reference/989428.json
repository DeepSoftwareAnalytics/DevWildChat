Like in 2nd row, after value 20, 2nd column value is missing.\n\nNow if we try to load this file into a hive table having 3 columns, hive will obviously load this file successfully, but if we try to capture the data from table having 2nd column value as NULL, it would return zero rows.\n\nBecause by default nothing is null between the delimiters. Evrything is data for Hive between the delimiters. Hive won’t treat a missing value as NULL value. It will be normal value for Hive, even if it is empty.\n\nLet’s load data from above file into it.\n\nAs we can see above, Hive is not putting null value in the empty values. We have checked it by where clause as well.\n\nNow to capture this NULL values or to marks these empty values as null values, we have to mention a table property while creation of table.\n\nLet’s create another table – We have used table property “serialization.null.format” is equals to “” (empty) as we want to replace empty fields with null. In case we want to replace spaces with null we would have to change the value(after equal to sign) while setting table property, so that it gets treated as null.\n\nAs we can see above, Hive is replacing empty fields with Null values now.\n\nNow after setting this property hive will treat every empty value as a Null value only.\n\nThat’s all for now.
