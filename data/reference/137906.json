        "document": "Events are things that happen in the system you are programming, which the system tells you about so your code can react to them. For example, if the user clicks a button on a webpage, you might want to react to that action by displaying an information box. In this article, we discuss some important concepts surrounding events, and look at the fundamentals of how they work in browsers. An understanding of HTML and the fundamentals of CSS, familiarity with JavaScript basics as covered in previous lessons.\n• What events are — a signal fired by the browser when something significant happens, which the developer can run some code in response to.\n• Setting up event handlers using (and ) and event handler properties.\n• Inline event handler attributes, and why you shouldn't use them.\n\nWhat is an event? Events are things that happen in the system you are programming — the system produces (or \"fires\") a signal of some kind when an event occurs, and provides a mechanism by which an action can be automatically taken (that is, some code running) when the event occurs. Events are fired inside the browser window, and tend to be attached to a specific item that resides in it. This might be a single element, a set of elements, the HTML document loaded in the current tab, or the entire browser window. There are many different types of events that can occur.\n• The user selects, clicks, or hovers the cursor over a certain element.\n• The user presses a key on the keyboard.\n• The user resizes or closes the browser window. You can gather from this (and from glancing at the MDN event reference) that there are a lot of events that can be fired. To react to an event, you attach an event handler to it. This is a block of code (usually a JavaScript function that you as a programmer create) that runs when the event fires. When such a block of code is defined to run in response to an event, we say we are registering an event handler. Note: Event handlers are sometimes called event listeners — they are pretty much interchangeable for our purposes, although strictly speaking, they work together. The listener listens out for the event happening, and the handler is the code that runs in response to it happening. Note: Web events are not part of the core JavaScript language — they are defined as part of the APIs built into the browser.\n\nIn the following example, we have a single in the page: Then we have some JavaScript. We'll look at this in more detail in the next section, but for now we can just say: it adds an event handler to the button's event, and the handler reacts to the event by setting the page background to a random color: The example output is as follows. Try clicking the button:\n\nIf you've added an event handler using , you can remove it again using the method. For example, this would remove the event handler: Event handlers can also be removed by passing an to and then later calling on the controller owning the . For example, to add an event handler that we can remove with an : const controller = new AbortController(); btn.addEventListener(\"click\", () => { const rndCol = `rgb(${random(255)} ${random(255)} ${random(255)})`; document.body.style.backgroundColor = rndCol; }, { signal: controller.signal } // pass an AbortSignal to this handler ); Then the event handler created by the code above can be removed like this: controller.abort(); // removes any/all event handlers associated with this controller For simple, small programs, cleaning up old, unused event handlers isn't necessary, but for larger, more complex programs, it can improve efficiency. Also, the ability to remove event handlers allows you to have the same button performing different actions in different circumstances: all you have to do is add or remove handlers.\n\nObjects (such as buttons) that can fire events also usually have properties whose name is followed by the name of the event. For example, elements have a property . This is called an event handler property. To listen for the event, you can assign the handler function to the property. For example, we could rewrite the random-color example like this: You can also set the handler property to a named function: With event handler properties, you can't add more than one handler for a single event. For example, you can call on an element multiple times, with different functions specified in the second argument: This is impossible with event handler properties because any subsequent attempts to set the property will overwrite earlier ones:\n\nYou might also see a pattern like this in your code: The earliest method of registering event handlers found on the Web involved event handler HTML attributes (or inline event handlers) like the one shown above — the attribute value is literally the JavaScript code you want to run when the event occurs. The above example invokes a function defined inside a element on the same page, but you could also insert JavaScript directly inside the attribute, for example: <button onclick=\"alert('Hello, this is my old-fashioned event handler!');\"> Press me </button> You can find HTML attribute equivalents for many of the event handler properties; however, you shouldn't use these — they are considered bad practice. It might seem easy to use an event handler attribute if you are doing something really quick, but they quickly become unmanageable and inefficient. For a start, it is not a good idea to mix up your HTML and your JavaScript, as it becomes hard to read. Keeping your JavaScript separate is a good practice, and if it is in a separate file you can apply it to multiple HTML documents. Even in a single file, inline event handlers are not a good idea. One button is OK, but what if you had 100 buttons? You'd have to add 100 attributes to the file; it would quickly turn into a maintenance nightmare. With JavaScript, you could easily add an event handler function to all the buttons on the page no matter how many there were, using something like this: Finally, many common server configurations will disallow inline JavaScript, as a security measure. You should never use the HTML event handler attributes — those are outdated, and using them is bad practice.\n\nSometimes, inside an event handler function, you'll see a parameter specified with a name such as , , or . This is called the event object, and it is automatically passed to event handlers to provide extra features and information. For example, let's rewrite our random color example again slightly: Note: You can find the full source code for this example on GitHub (also see it running live). Here you can see we are including an event object, e, in the function, and in the function setting a background color style on — which is the button itself. The property of the event object is always a reference to the element the event occurred upon. So, in this example, we are setting a random background color on the button, not the page. Note: You can use any name you like for the event object — you just need to choose a name that you can then use to reference it inside the event handler function. / / is most commonly used by developers because they are short and easy to remember. It's always good to be consistent — with yourself, and with others if possible.\n\nSometimes, you'll come across a situation where you want to prevent an event from doing what it does by default. The most common example is that of a web form, for example, a custom registration form. When you fill in the details and click the submit button, the natural behavior is for the data to be submitted to a specified page on the server for processing, and the browser to be redirected to a \"success message\" page of some kind (or the same page, if another is not specified). The trouble comes when the user has not submitted the data correctly — as a developer, you want to prevent the submission to the server and give an error message saying what's wrong and what needs to be done to put things right. Some browsers support automatic form data validation features, but since many don't, you are advised to not rely on those and implement your own validation checks. Let's look at an example. First, a simple HTML form that requires you to enter your first and last name: Now some JavaScript — here we implement a very simple check inside a handler for the event (the submit event is fired on a form when it is submitted) that tests whether the text fields are empty. If they are, we call the function on the event object — which stops the form submission — and then display an error message in the paragraph below our form to tell the user what's wrong: const form = document.querySelector(\"form\"); const fname = document.getElementById(\"fname\"); const lname = document.getElementById(\"lname\"); const para = document.querySelector(\"p\"); form.addEventListener(\"submit\", (e) => { if (fname.value === \"\" || lname.value === \"\") { e.preventDefault(); para.textContent = \"You need to fill in both names!\"; } }); Obviously, this is pretty weak form validation — it wouldn't stop the user from validating the form with spaces or numbers entered into the fields, for example — but it is OK for example purposes. The output is as follows: Note: For the full source code, see preventdefault-validation.html (also see it running live here)."

        "document": "Back in the day, websites used to be static, meaning users could only view the content but not interact with it. However, we can now create highly interactive user interfaces thanks to JavaScript and JS frameworks. Specifically, event handlers in JavaScript are what allow us to build dynamic web pages and deliver interactive experiences. In the modern web development landscape, events are essentially user actions that occur as a result of user interaction with the web page, such as submitting a form, clicking a button, playing a video on the web page, minimizing the browser window, etc. Event handling allows developers to verify and handle these actions to deliver a more responsive and engaging user experience.\n\nHence, understanding how events work and how to handle them efficiently is essential for every developer looking to create modern web applications. This article will discuss all the ins and outs of event handling in JavaScript. We’ll also briefly discuss how a good JavaScript framework like Ext JS handles events.\n\nEvents are essentially the actions that occur on a web app due to user interaction, such as clicking a button. In JavaScript, when an event occurs, the app fires the event, which is kind of a signal that an event has occurred. The app then automatically responds to the user in the form of output, thanks to event handlers in JavaScript. An event handler is essentially a function with a block of code that is executed or triggered when a specific event fires.\n\nSometimes, when an event occurs, it triggers multiple events. This is because web elements in an app are often nested. This is where event propagation comes in. Event propagation involves capturing and bubbling phases as the event travels across the DOM hierarchy. We’ll discuss these phases later in the article.\n\nThere are common types of events:\n• Keyboard/touch events: Occur when a user presses or releases a key on the keyboard or performs an action with a touch-enabled smartphone, laptop or tablet.\n• Click events: Fires when a user clicks on a button or other such web element.\n• Mouse hover events: These events are fired when a user performs an action with the mouse, such as scrolling a page or moving the cursor.\n• Form/submit events: Triggered when a user submits a form, modifies it, or resets it.\n• Drag and drop events: Occurs when a user drags and drops an element on the web page, such as dragging and dropping an image on a file uploader.\n\nAn event listener is essentially a JavaScript function that waits for a specific event to occur and then executes a callback function to respond to that event. Event listeners and event handlers are often considered the same thing. However, in essence, they work together to respond to an event. As the name suggests, the listener listens for the event, and the handler is the code that is executed in response to that event.\n\nThere are two common built-in event listener methods in JavaScript: addEventListener and removeEventListener. The addEventListener() method enables us to attach an event handler to an element. We can also add multiple event handlers to an element. removeEventListener() allows us to remove an event listener/handler from a specific element.\n\nWhen an event occurs, it belongs to a specific event object. The event object is essentially the argument passed into the callback/event handler function. It provides information about the event, such as the target element, the type of event, etc. It also contains additional properties for the specific event type.\n• target: Represents the element that fired the event.\n• type: Tells about the specific type of the event, such as click or submit\n• keyCode: Used for keyboard events. It contains the Unicode value of the key pressed by the user\n\nHere is an example code demonstrating the use of the event object (Click event):\n\nBased on the concepts we discussed in the previous sections, here is an example for creating a simple button-click event:\n\nHere is a basic example demonstrating how to handle form submissions:\n\nWeb browsers often have a default behavior for certain events. When such an event occurs, the browser’s default behavior is triggered in response to that event. preventDefault() provides us with a way to stop or prevent this default behavior.\n\nFor instance, when a user submits a form, the browser automatically initializes a request to the server. This results in page reload or navigation to a new page, affecting the user experience. Developers can use preventDefault() to stop this default behavior and handle form submission asynchronously without causing a page to reload. For example, in the above code, we’ve used preventDefault() to stop or prevent the default form submission behavior.\n\nEvent delegation in JavaScript is an advanced technique for handling events more efficiently. In event delegation, we add or attach an event listener/listeners to a common parent element. This way, we don’t have to attach the event listener to each element separately. Events are processed and monitored as they traverse the DOM hierarchy. Event delegation is common in popular javascript frameworks\n\nHere is an example of event delegation:\n\nHandling keyboard events, such as key down and key up, allows us to:\n• Respond to user interactions/inputs with the keyboard\n\nKey Down and Key Up are two main types of mouse events. A key-down event occurs when a user presses a key on the keyboard. A key-up event is triggered when a user releases the key after it is pressed down.\n\nHere is an example code for handling a key-down event:\n\nHere is an example code for handling a key-up event:\n\nHandling touch and mobile events to create a responsive and touch-friendly design, providing an intuitive way to interact with the web app.\n\nHere is an example code for Touchstart, Touchmove, and Touchend:\n• Gesture events, such as gesturestart, gesturechange, and gestureend. These events are used for gestures like pinch-zoom.\n• orientationchange event used for detecting changes in device orientation.\n\nAlso Read: Angular vs Ext JS: Which JavaScript Framework Should You Use?\n\nAs aforementioned, event bubbling and capturing are a part of the event propagation process. In event bubbling, the event starts from the same target element that fired the event. It then bubbles up or propagates through its parent and ancestor elements in the DOM till it reaches the root element. This allows you to handle the event in a parent element instead of the target element. Event bubbling is the default event behaviour on elements.\n\nIn event capturing, the event traverses from the outermost parent or ancestor element to the target element. It is also called event trickling.\n\nJavaScript also allows you to create and dispatch custom events designed to meet your specific application needs. For instance, you can create custom events for cross-component state management.\n\nHere is how to create a custom event:\n\nHere is how to dispatch the event:\n• Combine multiple events that trigger similar actions into one event listener.\n• Use event capturing only when needed. Otherwise, use bubbling.\n\nExt JS is a leading Javascript framework for creating high-performance web and mobile applications. It offers over 140+ pre-built components and supports MVVM architecture and two-way data binding. Events are a core concept in the Ext JS framework that enables your code to react to changes in your app. Here is an example code for button-click event in Ext JS:\n\nYou can learn more about handling events in Ext JS here.\n\nTransform your digital landscape with Sencha: Master JavaScript frameworks for unrivalled web development excellence\n\nIn the web development process, events refer to user actions, such as such as clicking a button, minimizing the browser window, or submitting a form. Event handling in JavaScript and JavaScript frameworks allows us to respond to user actions and interactions and create dynamic and interactive websites.

        "document": "You may have encountered situations where you need to add a large list of elements to a web page dynamically. For example, you may want to display a list of products, comments, search results, or other data that is fetched from an API or a database.\n\nHowever, adding a large list of elements to the web page can be challenging in terms of performance and user experience. If you directly manipulate the DOM for each element, you may cause unnecessary reflows and repaints, which can slow down the page rendering and make the user interface unresponsive.\n\nFortunately, there is a better way to handle this problem: using . are a special type of node that can hold other nodes without affecting the live DOM. They allow you to create and manipulate a large list of elements in memory, and then append them to the web page in one go. This can significantly improve the performance and user experience of your web application.\n\nIn this post, I will explain what are, how they differ from traditional DOM manipulation, and how to use them to add a large list of elements efficiently. I will also show you some best practices, real-world use cases, performance comparisons, and browser compatibility issues related to .\n\nA is a node that can contain other nodes, but is not part of the live DOM tree. It acts as a lightweight document that can store a fragment of HTML or XML content.\n\nYou can create a DocumentFragment using the method. This returns an empty object that you can populate with other nodes.\n\nUnlike regular nodes, do not have any parent or sibling nodes. They are isolated from the live DOM and do not trigger any reflows or repaints when you modify them. This means that you can add, remove, or change the nodes inside a DocumentFragment without affecting the web page layout or performance.\n\nWhen you are ready to insert the nodes from a DocumentFragment into the live DOM, you can use the or methods on any node that accepts child nodes. This will move all the nodes from the DocumentFragment to the specified location in the live DOM, and empty the DocumentFragment object.\n\nThe advantage of using is that they allow you to perform batch operations on a large number of nodes in memory, and then append them to the web page in one go. This reduces the number of DOM manipulations and improves the performance and user experience of your web application.\n\nTo understand why are useful, let's first look at what happens when you use traditional DOM manipulation to add a large list of elements to a web page.\n\nSuppose you have an empty element in your HTML document, and you want to add 1000 elements to it dynamically using JavaScript. One way to do this is to use a loop and create each element using the method. Then, for each element, you can set its text content using the property, and append it to the element using the method.\n\nHere is an example of how this code might look like:\n\n\n\nThis code seems simple and straightforward, but it has some serious drawbacks in terms of performance and user experience.\n\nFirst of all, every time you append an element to the element, you are modifying the live DOM tree. This means that the browser has to recalculate the layout and style of the web page, and repaint the affected regions on the screen. These operations are expensive and time-consuming, especially when you have a large number of complex elements.\n\nSecondly, every time you modify the live DOM tree, you are blocking the main thread of JavaScript execution. This means that while the loop is running, no other JavaScript code can run, and no user interactions can be processed. This can make the web page unresponsive and freeze the user interface until all the elements are added.\n\nAs a result, using traditional DOM manipulation for adding a large list of elements can cause poor performance and user experience issues such as:\n\nTo avoid the problems of traditional DOM manipulation, you can use to add a large list of elements efficiently.\n\nThe idea is to create a object, and populate it with the elements in memory. Then, you can append the DocumentFragment object to the element in one go. This way, you only modify the live DOM once, and avoid unnecessary reflows and repaints.\n\nHere is an example of how to use to add 1000 elements to a web page:\n\n\n\nWith , you perform a single DOM modification operation rather than 1000 individual ones. This optimization significantly reduces the overhead associated with layout calculations and repaints, resulting in a faster and smoother user experience.\n\nUnlike the first example, using doesn't block the main JavaScript thread. It means your web page remains responsive and doesn't freeze during the process, ensuring a better user experience.\n\nBy minimizing layout recalculations and repaints, your web application consumes fewer resources. This leads to lower CPU and memory usage, extending the life of mobile device batteries and providing a more energy-efficient experience.\n\nIn conclusion, DocumentFragments are a powerful tool in a web developer's toolkit. They enable you to efficiently add large lists of elements to a web page, improving performance and user experience. By batching DOM modifications and reducing rendering bottlenecks, you can create web applications that are both faster and more responsive.\n\nSo, the next time you're faced with adding a significant number of elements dynamically, remember DocumentFragments. They're the secret to a more efficient and user-friendly web."

As such, keeping those modifications to a minimum will help, however doing modifications in batches absorbs some of that performance hit (i.e. changing 3 DOM elements separately is more expensive than changing all 3 at once). So, group together your DOM changes as best you can.\n\nThe actual mechanism you use to inject the new content could either be by:\n• None Passing a string of HTML to the HTML parser and asking it to parse on demand the string. This is essentially the same as the process that happens when the page is being parsed from the server. Using the standard or JQuery accomplishes this.\n• None You could also build up the DOM element in memory first and then inject that node into the DOM at the right time (i.e. or ). I generally favor this approach as it is more programmatic, vastly reduces the possibility of string concatenation and quotation errors and is cleaner to read. From a performance standpoint, this gives you the benefit of getting some of the work done prior to DOM injection time. This would be the equivalent of the DOM or the JQuery methods.\n\nIn the end, today's modern user agents handle DOM changes much better than they used to and either approach is viable.

        "document": "The element is so powerful because of its attributes; the attribute, described with examples above, being the most important. Since every element, regardless of type, is based on the interface, they technically share the exact same set of attributes. However, in reality, most attributes have an effect on only a specific subset of input types. In addition, the way some attributes impact an input depends on the input type, impacting different input types in different ways. This section provides a table listing all the attributes with a brief description. This table is followed by a list describing each attribute in greater detail, along with which input types they are associated with. Those that are common to most or all input types are defined in greater detail below. Attributes that are unique to particular input types—or attributes which are common to all input types but have special behaviors when used on a given input type—are instead documented on those types' pages. Attributes for the element include the global HTML attributes and additionally: alt attribute for the image type. Required for accessibility all except , , and all except , , and buttons Whether the command or control is checked Name of form field to use for sending the element's directionality in form submission Whether the form control is disabled URL to use for form submission Form data set encoding type to use for form submission HTTP method to use for form submission Same as height attribute for ; vertical dimension all except , , , , and buttons Value of the id attribute of the of autocomplete options Boolean. Whether to allow multiple values Name of the form control. Submitted with the form as part of a name/value pair Pattern the must match to be valid Text that appears in the form control when it has no value set Designates an as a control for a popover element Specifies the action that a popover control should perform all except , , , , , and buttons Boolean. The value is not editable all except , , , and buttons Boolean. A value is required or must be checked for the form to be submittable Same as attribute for ; address of image resource The value of the control. When specified in the HTML, corresponds to the initial value Same as attribute for A few additional non-standard attributes are listed following the descriptions of the standard attributes.\n\nLabels are needed to associate assistive text with an . The element provides explanatory information about a form field that is always appropriate (aside from any layout concerns you have). It's never a bad idea to use a to explain what should be entered into an or . The semantic pairing of and elements is useful for assistive technologies such as screen readers. By pairing them using the 's attribute, you bond the label to the input in a way that lets screen readers describe inputs to users more precisely. It does not suffice to have plain text adjacent to the element. Rather, usability and accessibility requires the inclusion of either implicit or explicit : <!-- inaccessible --> <p>Enter your name: <input id=\"name\" type=\"text\" size=\"30\" /></p> <!-- implicit label --> <p> <label>Enter your name: <input id=\"name\" type=\"text\" size=\"30\" /></label> </p> <!-- explicit label --> <p> <label for=\"name\">Enter your name: </label> <input id=\"name\" type=\"text\" size=\"30\" /> </p> The first example is inaccessible: no relationship exists between the prompt and the element. In addition to an accessible name, the label provides a larger 'hit' area for mouse and touch screen users to click on or touch. By pairing a with an , clicking on either one will focus the . If you use plain text to \"label\" your input, this won't happen. Having the prompt part of the activation area for the input is helpful for people with motor control conditions. As web developers, it's important that we never assume that people will know all the things that we know. The diversity of people using the web—and by extension your website—practically guarantees that some of your site's visitors will have some variation in thought processes and/or circumstances that leads them to interpret your forms very differently from you without clear and properly-presented labels. The attribute lets you specify text that appears within the element's content area itself when it is empty. The placeholder should never be required to understand your forms. It is not a label, and should not be used as a substitute, because it isn't. The placeholder is used to provide a hint as to what an inputted value should look like, not an explanation or prompt. Not only is the placeholder not accessible to screen readers, but once the user enters any text into the form control, or if the form control already has a value, the placeholder disappears. Browsers with automatic page translation features may skip over attributes when translating, meaning the may not get translated. Note: Don't use the attribute if you can avoid it. If you need to label an element, use the element.\n\nWarning: Client-side validation is useful, but it does not guarantee that the server will receive valid data. If the data must be in a specific format, always verify it also on the server-side, and return a HTTP response if the format is invalid. In addition to using CSS to style inputs based on the or UI states based on the current state of each input, as noted in the UI pseudo-classes section above, the browser provides for client-side validation on (attempted) form submission. On form submission, if there is a form control that fails constraint validation, supporting browsers will display an error message on the first invalid form control; displaying a default message based on the error type, or a message set by you. Some input types and other attributes place limits on what values are valid for a given input. For example, means only the number 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 are valid. Several errors could occur, including a error if the value is less than 2, if greater than 10, if the value is a number between 2 and 10, but not an even integer (does not match the requirements of the attribute), or if the value is not a number. For the input types whose domain of possible values is periodic (that is, at the highest possible value, the values wrap back around to the beginning rather than ending), it's possible for the values of the and properties to be reversed, which indicates that the range of permitted values starts at , wraps around to the lowest possible value, then continues on until is reached. This is particularly useful for dates and times, such as when you want to allow the range to be from 8 PM to 8 AM: Specific attributes and their values can lead to a specific error : Validity object errors depend on the attributes and their values: Occurs when the value is greater than the maximum value as defined by the attribute Occurs when the number of characters is greater than the number allowed by the property Occurs when the value is less than the minimum value as defined by the attribute Occurs when the number of characters is less than the number required by the property Occurs when a pattern attribute is included with a valid regular expression and the does not match it. Occurs when the attribute is present but the value is or radio or checkbox is not checked. The value doesn't match the step increment. Increment default is , so only integers are valid on is step is not included. will never throw this error. Occurs when the value is not of the correct type, for example an email does not contain an or a url doesn't contain a protocol. If a form control doesn't have the attribute, no value, or an empty string, is not invalid. Even if the above attributes are present, with the exception of , an empty string will not lead to an error. We can set limits on what values we accept, and supporting browsers will natively validate these form values and alert the user if there is a mistake when the form is submitted. In addition to the errors described in the table above, the interface contains the , , and boolean readonly properties. The validity object includes: For each of these Boolean properties, a value of indicates that the specified reason validation may have failed is true, with the exception of the property, which is if the element's value obeys all constraints. If there is an error, supporting browsers will both alert the user and prevent the form from being submitted. A word of caution: if a custom error is set to a truthy value (anything other than the empty string or ), the form will be prevented from being submitted. If there is no custom error message, and none of the other properties return true, will be true, and the form can be submitted. function validate(input) { let validityState_object = input.validity; if (validityState_object.valueMissing) { input.setCustomValidity(\"A value is required\"); } else if (validityState_object.rangeUnderflow) { input.setCustomValidity(\"Your value is too low\"); } else if (validityState_object.rangeOverflow) { input.setCustomValidity(\"Your value is too high\"); } else { input.setCustomValidity(\"\"); } } The last line, setting the custom validity message to the empty string is vital. If the user makes an error, and the validity is set, it will fail to submit, even if all the values are valid, until the message is . If you want to present a custom error message when a field fails to validate, you need to use the Constraint Validation API available on (and related) elements. Take the following form: The basic HTML form validation features will cause this to produce a default error message if you try to submit the form with either no valid filled in, or a value that does not match the . If you wanted to instead display custom error messages, you could use JavaScript like the following: const nameInput = document.querySelector(\"input\"); nameInput.addEventListener(\"input\", () => { nameInput.setCustomValidity(\"\"); nameInput.checkValidity(); }); nameInput.addEventListener(\"invalid\", () => { if (nameInput.value === \"\") { nameInput.setCustomValidity(\"Enter your username!\"); } else { nameInput.setCustomValidity( \"Usernames can only contain upper and lowercase letters. Try again!\", ); } }); The example renders like so:\n• We check the valid state of the input element every time its value is changed by running the method via the event handler.\n• If the value is invalid, an event is raised, and the event handler function is run. Inside this function we work out whether the value is invalid because it is empty, or because it doesn't match the pattern, using an block, and set a custom validity error message.\n• As a result, if the input value is invalid when the submit button is pressed, one of the custom error messages will be shown.\n• If it is valid, it will submit as you'd expect. For this to happen, the custom validity has to be cancelled, by invoking with an empty string value. We therefore do this every time the event is raised. If you don't do this, and a custom validity was previously set, the input will register as invalid, even if it currently contains a valid value on submission. Note: Always validate input constraints both client side and server side. Constraint validation doesn't remove the need for validation on the server side. Invalid values can still be sent by older browsers or by bad actors. Note: Firefox supported a proprietary error attribute — — for many versions, which allowed you set custom error messages in a similar way. This has been removed as of version 66 (see Firefox bug 1513890)."

        "document": "In the previous article we looked at the element, covering the original values of the attribute available since the early days of HTML. Now we'll look in detail at the functionality of some input types that were added later. To understand the newer input type values available to create native form controls, and how to implement them using HTML. Because HTML form control appearance may be quite different from a designer's specifications, web developers sometimes build their own custom form controls. We cover this in an advanced tutorial: How to build custom form widgets.\n\nThis type of field is set using the value for the attribute: When this is used, the value must be an email address to be valid. Any other content causes the browser to display an error when the form is submitted. You can see this in action in the screenshot below. You can use the attribute in combination with the input type to allow several comma-separated email addresses to be entered in the same input: On some devices — notably, touch devices with dynamic keyboards like smartphones — a different virtual keypad might be presented that is more suitable for entering email addresses, including the key: Note: You can find examples of the basic text input types at basic input examples (see the source code also). This is another good reason for using these newer input types, improving the user experience for users of these devices.\n\nAs you can see above, — along with other newer types — provides built-in client-side error validation, performed by the browser before the data gets sent to the server. It is a helpful aid to guide users to fill out a form accurately, and it can save time: it is useful to know that your data is not correct immediately, rather than having to wait for a round trip to the server. But it should not be considered an exhaustive security measure! Your apps should always perform security checks on any form-submitted data on the server-side as well as the client-side, because client-side validation is too easy to turn off, so malicious users can still easily send bad data through to your server. Read Website security for an idea of what could happen; implementing server-side validation is somewhat beyond the scope of this module, but you should bear it in mind. Note that is a valid email address according to the default provided constraints. This is because the input type allows intranet email addresses by default. To implement different validation behavior, you can use the attribute. You can also customize the error messages. We'll talk about how to use these features in the Client-side form validation article later on. Note: If the data entered is not an email address, the pseudo-class will match, and the property will return .\n\nSearch fields are intended to be used to create search boxes on pages and apps. This type of field is set by using the value for the attribute: The main difference between a field and a field is how the browser styles its appearance. In some browsers, fields are rendered with rounded corners. In some browsers, an \"Ⓧ\" clear icon is displayed, which clears the field of any value when clicked. This clear icon only appears if the field has a value, and, apart from Safari, it is only displayed when the field is focused. Additionally, on devices with dynamic keyboards, the keyboard's enter key may read \"search\", or display a magnifying glass icon. Another worth-noting feature is that the values of a field can be automatically saved and re-used to offer auto-completion across multiple pages of the same website; this tends to happen automatically in most modern browsers.\n\nA special field for filling in phone numbers can be created using as the value of the attribute: When accessed via a touch device with a dynamic keyboard, most devices will display a numeric keypad when is encountered, meaning this type is useful whenever a numeric keypad is useful, and doesn't just have to be used for telephone numbers. Due to the wide variety of phone number formats around the world, this type of field does not enforce any constraints on the value entered by a user (this means it may include letters, etc.). As we mentioned earlier, the attribute can be used to enforce constraints, which you'll learn about in Client-side form validation.\n\nControls for entering numbers can be created with an of . This control looks like a text field but allows only floating-point numbers, and usually provides buttons in the form of a spinner to increase and decrease the value of the control. On devices with dynamic keyboards, the numeric keyboard is generally displayed. With the input type, you can constrain the minimum and maximum values allowed by setting the and attributes. You can also use the attribute to set the increment increase and decrease caused by pressing the spinner buttons. By default, the number input type only validates if the number is an integer, as the attribute defaults to . To allow float numbers, specify or a specific value, like to restrict the floating point. If omitted, as the value defaults to , only whole numbers are valid. Let's look at some examples: This example creates a number control whose valid value is restricted to an odd value between and . The increase and decrease buttons change the value by , starting with the value. <label for=\"number\">Enter an odd number between 1 and 10:</label><br /> This example creates a number control whose value is restricted to any value between and inclusive, and whose increase and decrease buttons change its value by . The input type makes sense when the range of valid values is limited, such as a person's age or height. If the range is too large for incremental increases to make sense (such as USA ZIP codes, which range from to ), the type might be a better option; it provides the numeric keypad while forgoing the number's spinner UI feature.\n\nAnother way to pick a number is to use a slider. You see these quite often on sites like shopping sites where you want to set a maximum property price to filter by. Let's look at a live example to illustrate this: Usage-wise, sliders are less accurate than text fields. Therefore, they are used to pick a number whose precise value is not necessarily important. A slider is created using the with its attribute set to the value . The slider-thumb can be moved via mouse or touch, or with the arrows of the keypad. It's important to properly configure your slider. To that end, it's highly recommended that you set the , , and attributes which set the minimum, maximum, and increment values, respectively. Let's look at the code behind the above example, so you can see how it's done. First of all, the basic HTML: This example creates a slider whose value may range between and , which increments/decrements by 1000 at a time. We've given it a default value of , using the attribute. One problem with sliders is that they don't offer any kind of visual feedback as to what the current value is. This is why we've included an element to contain the current value. You could display an input value or the output of a calculation inside any element, but is special — like — and it can take a attribute that allows you to associate it with the element or elements that the output value came from. To actually display the current value, and update it as it changes, you must use JavaScript, which can be accomplished with a few statements: Here we store references to the input and the in two variables. Then we immediately set the 's to the current of the input. Finally, an event listener is set to ensure that whenever the range slider is moved, the 's is updated to the new value.\n\nGenerally, for a good user experience when gathering date and time values, it is important to provide a calendar selection UI. These enable users to select dates without needing to context switch to a native calendar application or potentially entering them in differing formats that are hard to parse. The last minute of the previous millennium can be expressed in the following different ways: , , or . HTML date controls are available to handle this specific kind of data, providing calendar widgets and making the data uniform. A date and time control is created using the element and an appropriate value for the attribute, depending on whether you wish to collect dates, times, or both. Here's a live example: Let's look at the different available types in brief. Note that the usage of these types is quite complex, especially considering browser support (see below); to find out the full details, follow the links below to the reference pages for each type, including detailed examples."

        "document": "HTML5 data attributes are like secret codes for your web pages. They store extra information without cluttering your HTML. Imagine being able to add data to your HTML elements that can be used by JavaScript, CSS, or even just to make your HTML more meaningful. This little trick can make your code cleaner, more flexible, and easier to manage. In this article, we’ll dive into how to use HTML5 data attributes to write better, more efficient code. Let’s get started!\n\nHTML5 data attributes are custom attributes that you can add to HTML elements. They start with followed by a name you choose. For example, can store a user ID.\n\nThese attributes are great for storing data that you can easily access and manipulate with JavaScript or CSS.\n\nData attributes help keep your HTML clean and organized. They allow you to embed extra data directly into HTML elements without affecting the look or behavior of your web page.\n\nThis means you can add as much custom data as you need without cluttering your code with extra tags or scripts.\n\nHow to Use HTML5 Data Attributes\n\nTo add a data attribute, you simply include it within an HTML tag. For example:\n\nIn this example, the tag has two data attributes: and . You can name your data attributes anything you like, as long as they start with .\n\nYou can easily access and manipulate data attributes using JavaScript. Here’s how you can do it:\n\nThis code snippet finds the element with the attribute and then retrieves its value. You can use this method to read any data attribute.\n\nYou can also change the value of a data attribute using JavaScript. Here’s an example:\n\nThis changes the value from to . You can use this method to update any data attribute dynamically.\n\nOne common use of data attributes is to store configuration settings. For example, you might have a button that performs different actions based on the data attributes it holds:\n\nWith JavaScript, you can read these attributes and decide what action to perform when the button is clicked:\n\nThis makes your code more flexible and easier to maintain.\n\nData attributes can also be used in CSS to apply styles based on the values of those attributes. For example:\n\nYou can style these elements differently using CSS:\n\nThis way, you can change the look of elements dynamically without adding extra classes or IDs.\n\nAnother practical use of data attributes is tracking user interaction. For example, you might want to track how many times a user clicks a button:\n\nWith JavaScript, you can update the data attribute each time the button is clicked:\n\nThis approach lets you keep track of user interactions directly within your HTML, making it easier to manage and analyze.\n\nUsing Data Attributes for Better Code Management\n\nData attributes can simplify your JavaScript code by eliminating the need for complex logic to find and manage elements. Instead of writing long and convoluted scripts to manage state or configurations, you can embed this data directly within your HTML.\n\nThis keeps your JavaScript cleaner and more focused on the functionality rather than the data management.\n\nFor example, instead of using a series of if-else statements to check the class names or IDs of elements, you can use data attributes to store the state of an element:\n\nAnd in your JavaScript, you can simply check these attributes:\n\nData attributes are very useful when dealing with dynamic content. They allow you to store data related to an element that can be easily accessed and updated.\n\nFor instance, in a dynamic list of items, you can use data attributes to keep track of item IDs, user preferences, or any other metadata without cluttering your DOM.\n\nWith JavaScript, you can manipulate these items based on their data attributes:\n\nData attributes can also be helpful in form handling, making it easier to manage form fields and their validations. By storing additional data like validation rules directly in the form elements, you can create a more organized and efficient validation process.\n\nIn your JavaScript, you can loop through the form fields and validate them based on the data attributes:\n\nSingle Page Applications (SPAs) benefit greatly from data attributes for managing state. Since SPAs often rely heavily on JavaScript to render content dynamically, using data attributes to store the state of various components can simplify your code.\n\nJavaScript can use this attribute to determine what content to render:\n\nData attributes can also play a role in SEO (Search Engine Optimization). While data attributes themselves are not directly used by search engines, they can help you manage your HTML structure better.\n\nBy keeping your HTML clean and organized, you make it easier for search engines to crawl and index your content.\n\nFor instance, you might use data attributes to manage and load content dynamically while ensuring that your main HTML structure remains clear and semantic. This helps search engines understand your content better, which can improve your rankings.\n\nAccessibility is a crucial aspect of web development, and data attributes can assist in making your website more accessible. For example, you can use data attributes to store additional information that can be used by assistive technologies.\n\nJavaScript can then use this data to enhance the accessibility features:\n\nThis approach ensures that users with disabilities have a better experience when interacting with your website.\n\nOne of the advanced uses of HTML5 data attributes is conditional styling. By using JavaScript in combination with CSS, you can change the style of elements based on their data attributes dynamically.\n\nIn your CSS, you can define styles for these themes:\n\nWith JavaScript, you can toggle these themes based on user actions:\n\nThis technique allows for a highly interactive and customizable user experience.\n\nModern JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js heavily utilize data attributes for data binding and component state management. These frameworks use a declarative approach where you can bind HTML elements to data models, and changes in data automatically reflect in the UI.\n\nFor example, in Vue.js, you can bind data attributes to Vue instance properties:\n\nHere, the attribute binds the property from the Vue instance to the , and binds the method to the button click event. This approach simplifies the code and makes it more maintainable.\n\nHTML5 data attributes can also be used for tracking user interactions for analytics purposes. By embedding tracking information directly within HTML elements, you can collect detailed data on how users interact with your site.\n\nWith a simple JavaScript snippet, you can send this data to your analytics platform:\n\nThis method provides a clean and efficient way to implement analytics tracking without cluttering your JavaScript code.\n\nCustom data attributes can be extremely useful in forms, particularly for managing validation, pre-filling data, or handling user input dynamically. For example, you can use data attributes to specify custom validation rules or to provide additional information about form fields.\n\nYou can then use JavaScript to handle form validation:\n\nThis approach keeps your form validation logic simple and flexible.\n\nData attributes can enhance user experience by providing dynamic content changes without requiring full page reloads. For instance, you might have a content section that updates based on user interactions.\n\nJavaScript can then handle content changes:\n\nThis technique makes your website more interactive and engaging, providing users with instant feedback based on their actions.\n\nAdvanced Uses and Examples of HTML5 Data Attributes\n\nWeb components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create custom, reusable HTML tags. Data attributes can be particularly useful in web components to pass and manage data.\n\nYou can define this custom element using JavaScript:\n\nThis custom element reads data attributes and renders a user profile dynamically. Web components make it easier to encapsulate functionality and reuse it across different parts of your application.\n\nData attributes can also store JSON data, which can be particularly useful for more complex data structures. However, keep in mind that while this method is convenient, it should be used judiciously to avoid performance issues.\n\nFor example, you might have a data attribute that holds JSON data for a product:\n\nYou can then parse this data with JavaScript:\n\nUsing JSON data in this way allows you to manage more complex data structures directly within your HTML.\n\nLocalization is the process of adapting your web application to different languages and regions. Data attributes can help manage and switch content based on user preferences or location.\n\nJavaScript can switch content based on the user’s language preference:\n\nThis approach allows you to dynamically change the language of your content without reloading the page.\n\nData attributes can be used for dynamic data binding, especially in environments where frameworks like Angular or Vue.js are not in use. This can be achieved with plain JavaScript by updating elements in real-time based on user interactions or other events.\n\nThis allows for real-time updates and interactions within your web application, enhancing user engagement.\n\nIn larger applications, keeping track of data can become complex. Data attributes can help manage and track state changes across different components and sections of your application.\n\nThis method keeps your HTML organized and your JavaScript focused on functionality, making it easier to manage larger codebases.\n\nData attributes can also be used to integrate with external APIs, making it easier to fetch and display data dynamically. For example, you might use data attributes to specify API endpoints or parameters.\n\nJavaScript can fetch data from the API and update the content dynamically:\n\nThis approach integrates data fetching and display seamlessly within your HTML structure.\n\nData attributes can significantly enhance the functionality and user experience of e-commerce websites. By embedding additional product information directly into HTML elements, you can streamline processes like adding items to a cart, displaying product details, and handling user interactions more effectively.\n\nFor example, let’s say you have a list of products on your e-commerce site:\n\nWith JavaScript, you can handle the “Add to Cart” functionality by reading the data attributes:\n\nThis approach keeps your code organized and makes it easier to manage product details dynamically.\n\nData attributes can be used to personalize user experiences on your website. By storing user preferences and other personalized data in data attributes, you can dynamically change content and functionality based on these preferences.\n\nFor instance, you might have a website that displays different themes based on user preferences:\n\nThis method allows for a more interactive and personalized user experience.\n\nForms are a critical component of many web applications, and data attributes can simplify their management and validation. By storing validation rules and error messages in data attributes, you can create a more dynamic and user-friendly form experience.\n\nThis approach keeps your form validation logic simple and flexible, improving the overall user experience.\n\nFeature flags allow you to enable or disable features in your web application dynamically. Data attributes can be an effective way to manage these flags without altering your core codebase.\n\nJavaScript can check the feature flag and display content accordingly:\n\nThis technique allows you to manage features more flexibly, enabling or disabling them as needed without extensive code changes.\n\nIn real-time applications, such as chat apps or dashboards, data attributes can be used to manage and update content dynamically.\n\nJavaScript can fetch new messages and update the chat dynamically:\n\nThis method ensures that your application can handle real-time data updates efficiently.\n\nHTML5 data attributes simplify the development process by allowing you to store additional information directly within HTML elements. This reduces the need for complex JavaScript logic to manage and retrieve data, making your code more readable and maintainable.\n\nData attributes provide a flexible way to manage and manipulate data within your web applications. Whether you are handling user interactions, managing state in single-page applications, or integrating with external APIs, data attributes offer a straightforward solution that keeps your HTML clean and your JavaScript focused on functionality.\n\nBy using data attributes, you can create more interactive and personalized user experiences. They allow for dynamic content updates, real-time data handling, and enhanced form validation, all of which contribute to a better user experience.\n\nThis not only improves user satisfaction but also helps in achieving business goals by increasing engagement and retention.\n\nData attributes help in boosting the performance of your web applications by reducing the dependency on external data stores and minimizing the complexity of your JavaScript code.\n\nBy embedding necessary data directly within HTML elements, you can ensure faster access and manipulation, leading to quicker load times and a more responsive application.\n\nIncorporating HTML5 data attributes into your web development practices aligns with modern web development principles.\n\nThey promote clean, semantic HTML, reduce the need for additional HTML elements or JavaScript objects, and support the development of scalable and maintainable web applications.\n\nThe web development landscape is continually evolving, and keeping up with new techniques and best practices is crucial. HTML5 data attributes are a powerful tool that can be used in various scenarios to improve your web applications.\n\nContinual learning and adaptation of these techniques will help you stay ahead in the fast-paced world of web development.\n\nHTML5 data attributes are a powerful and versatile tool for web developers.

So, if you want to alert the user, you must write JavaScript code.\n\nThe input and attributes specify the minimum and maximum values for an input field.\n\nThe and attributes work with the following input types: number, range, date, datetime-local, month, time and week.\n\nTip: Use the max and min attributes together to create a range of legal values.\n\nThe input attribute specifies that the user is allowed to enter more than one value in an input field.\n\nThe attribute works with the following input types: email, and file.\n\nThe input attribute specifies a regular expression that the input field's value is checked against, when the form is submitted.\n\nThe attribute works with the following input types: text, date, search, url, tel, email, and password.\n\nTip: Use the global title attribute to describe the pattern to help the user.\n\nTip: Learn more about regular expressions in our JavaScript tutorial.\n\nThe input attribute specifies a short hint that describes the expected value of an input field (a sample value or a short description of the expected format).\n\nThe short hint is displayed in the input field before the user enters a value.\n\nThe attribute works with the following input types: text, search, url, number, tel, email, and password.\n\nThe input attribute specifies that an input field must be filled out before submitting the form.\n\nThe attribute works with the following input types: text, search, url, tel, email, password, date pickers, number, checkbox, radio, and file.\n\nThe input attribute specifies the legal number intervals for an input field.\n\nExample: if step=\"3\", legal numbers could be -3, 0, 3, 6, etc.\n\nTip: This attribute can be used together with the max and min attributes to create a range of legal values.\n\nThe attribute works with the following input types: number, range, date, datetime-local, month, time and week.\n\nThe input attribute specifies that an input field should automatically get focus when the page loads.\n\nThe input and attributes specify the height and width of an element.\n\nTip: Always specify both the height and width attributes for images. If height and width are set, the space required for the image is reserved when the page is loaded. Without these attributes, the browser does not know the size of the image, and cannot reserve the appropriate space to it. The effect will be that the page layout will change during loading (while the images load).\n\nThe input attribute refers to a element that contains pre-defined options for an <input> element.\n\nThe input attribute specifies whether a form or an input field should have autocomplete on or off.\n\nAutocomplete allows the browser to predict the value. When a user starts to type in a field, the browser should display options to fill in the field, based on earlier typed values.\n\nThe attribute works with and the following types: text, search, url, tel, email, password, datepickers, range, and color.\n\nTip: In some browsers you may need to activate an autocomplete function for this to work (Look under \"Preferences\" in the browser's menu)."
