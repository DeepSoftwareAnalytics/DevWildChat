Find the container name using then remove that container using: The error you are facing might occur if you previously tried running the command while the file was not present at the location where it should have been in the host directory. In this case docker daemon would have created a directory inside the container in its place, which later fails to map to the proper file when the correct files are put in the host directory and the docker command is run again. Remove the volumes that are associated with the container. If you are not concerned about other container volumes, you can also use: # WARNING, THIS WILL REMOVE ALL VOLUMES docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q)\n\nThere have been at least 3 answers here touching on the problem, but not explaining it properly and not giving a full solution. This is just a folder mounting problem. Docker Toolbox bypasses the Hyper-V requirement of Docker by creating a virtual machine (in VirtualBox, which comes bundled). Docker is installed and ran inside the VM. In order for Docker to function properly, it needs to have access to the from the host machine. Which here it doesn't. After I installed Docker Toolbox it created the VirtualBox VM and only mounted to the machine, as . My project was in so nowhere on the mounted volume. When I was sending the path to the VM, it would not exist, as isn't mounted. Hence, the error above. Let's say I had my project containing my ngnix config in\n• None Go to VirtualBox, right click on Default (the VM from Docker) > Settings > Shared Folders\n• None Clicking the small icon with the plus on the right side, Add a new share. I used the following settings:\n• The above will map to ( ) in the VM, meaning that now you can reference any path in projects like this: - because from is now mounted. To use relative paths, please consider naming the path not\n• Restart everything and it should now work properly. I manually stopped the virtual machine in VirtualBox and restarted the Docker Toolbox CLI. In my docker file, I now reference the like this: Where nginx.conf actually resides in\n\nI had the same problem. I was using Docker Desktop with WSL in Windows 10 17.09. The problem is that Docker for Windows expects you to supply your volume paths in a format that matches this: BUT, WSL instead uses the format: This is confusing because when checking the file in the console I saw it, and for me everything was correct. I wasn't aware of the Docker for Windows expectations about the volume paths. I binded the custom mount points to fix Docker for Windows and WSL differences: Like suggested in this amazing guide: Setting Up Docker for Windows and WSL to Work Flawlessly and everything is working perfectly now. Before I started using WSL I was using Git Bash and I had this problem as well."
