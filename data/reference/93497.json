        "document": "Tutorial: Import the C++ standard library using modules from the command line\n\nLearn how to import the C++ standard library using C++ library modules. This results in faster compilation and is more robust than using header files or header units or precompiled headers (PCH).\n\nIn this tutorial, learn about:\n• How to import the standard library as a module from the command line.\n• The performance and usability benefits of modules.\n• The two standard library modules and and the difference between them.\n\nThis tutorial requires Visual Studio 2022 17.5 or later.\n\nHeader file semantics can change depending on macro definitions, the order in which you include them, and they slow compilation. Modules solve these problems.\n\nIt's now possible to import the standard library as a module instead of as a tangle of header files. This is much faster and more robust than including header files or header units or precompiled headers (PCH).\n\nThe C++23 standard library introduces two named modules: and :\n• exports the declarations and names defined in the C++ standard library namespace , such as . It also exports the contents of C wrapper headers such as and , which provide functions like . C functions defined in the global namespace, such as , aren't exported. This improves the situation where including a C wrapper header like also includes C header files like , which bring in the C global namespace versions. This isn't a problem if you import .\n• exports everything in and adds the C runtime global namespaces such as , , , , and so on. The module makes it easier to work with codebases that refer to many C runtime functions/types in the global namespace.\n\nThe compiler imports the entire standard library when you use or and does it faster than bringing in a single header file. It's faster to bring in the entire standard library with (or ) than to , for example.\n\nBecause named modules don't expose macros, macros like , , , , and others aren't available when you import or . See Standard library named module considerations for workarounds.\n\nHeader files are how declarations and definitions have been shared between source files in C++. Before standard library modules, you'd include the part of the standard library you needed with a directive like . Header files are fragile and difficult to compose because their semantics may change depending on the order you include them, or whether certain macros are defined. They also slow compilation because they're reprocessed by every source file that includes them.\n\nC++20 introduces a modern alternative called modules. In C++23, we were able to capitalize on module support to introduce named modules to represent the standard library.\n\nLike header files, modules allow you to share declarations and definitions across source files. But unlike header files, modules aren't fragile and are easier to compose because their semantics don't change due to macro definitions or the order in which you import them. The compiler can process modules much faster than it can process files, and uses less memory at compile time as well. Named modules don't expose macro definitions or private implementation details.\n\nThis article demonstrates the new and best way to consume the standard library. For more information about alternative ways to consume the standard library, see Compare header units, modules, and precompiled headers.\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to consume the standard library as a module using the command line compiler. For information about how to do this in the Visual Studio IDE, see Build ISO C++23 Standard Library Modules.\n\nThe statement or imports the standard library into your application. But first, you must compile the standard library named modules into binary form. The following steps demonstrate how.\n\nExample: How to build and import\n• None Open a x86 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS: from the Windows Start menu, type x86 native and the prompt should appear in the list of apps. Ensure that the prompt is for Visual Studio 2022 version 17.5 or above. You get errors if you use the wrong version of the prompt. The examples used in this tutorial are for the CMD shell.\n• None Create a directory, such as , and make it the current directory. If you choose a directory that you don't have write access to, you'll get errors during compilation.\n• None Compile the named module with the following command: If you get errors, ensure that you're using the correct version of the command prompt. Compile the named module using the same compiler settings that you intend to use with the code that imports the built module. If you have a multi-project solution, you can compile the standard library named module once, and then refer to it from all of your projects by using the compiler option. Using the previous compiler command, the compiler outputs two files:\n• is the compiled binary representation of the named module interface that the compiler consults to process the statement. This is a compile-time only artifact. It doesn't ship with your application.\n• contains the implementation of the named module. Add to the command line when you compile the sample app to statically link the functionality you use from the standard library into your application. The key command-line switches in this example are: Use the latest version of the C++ language standard and library. Although module support is available under , you need the latest standard library to get support for standard library named modules. Use C++ exception handling, except for functions marked . Using /W4 is generally recommended, especially for new projects because it enables all level 1, level 2, level 3, and most level 4 (informational) warnings, which can help you catch potential issues early. It essentially provides lint-like warnings that can help ensure the fewest possible hard-to-find code defects. Compile without linking, because we're just building the binary named module interface at this point. You can control the object file name and the named module interface file name with the following switches:\n• sets the name of the object file. For example, . By default, the compiler uses the same name for the object file as the module source file ( ) you're compiling. In the example, the object file name is by default because we're compiling the module file .\n• sets the name of the named module interface file ( ). For example, . By default, the compiler uses the same name for the module interface file ( ) as the module source file ( ) you're compiling. In the example, the generated file is by default because we're compiling the module file .\n• None Import the library you built by first creating a file named with the following content: // requires /std:c++latest import std; int main() { std::cout << \"Import the STL library for best performance\n\n\"; std::vector<int> v{5, 5, 5}; for (const auto& e : v) { std::cout << e; } } In the preceding code, replaces and . The statement makes all of the standard library available with one statement. Importing the entire standard library is often much faster than processing a single standard library header file such as .\n• None Compile the example by using the following command in the same directory as the previous step: It isn't necessary to specify on the command line in this example because the compiler automatically looks for the file matching the module name specified by the statement. When the compiler encounters it can find if it's located in the same directory as the source code. If the file is in a different directory than the source code, use the compiler switch to refer to it. In this example, compiling the source code and linking the module's implementation into the application are separate steps. They don't have to be. You could use to compile and link in one step. But it may be convenient to build and link separately because then you only need to build the standard library named module once, and then you can refer to it from your project, or from multiple projects, in your build's link step. If you're building a single project, you can combine the steps of building the standard library named module and the step of building your application by adding to the command line. Put it before any files that consume the module. By default, the output executable's name is taken from the first input file. Use the compiler option to specify the executable file name you want. This tutorial shows compiling the named module as a separate step because you only need to build the standard library named module once, and then you can refer to it from your project, or from multiple projects. But it may be convenient to build everything together, as shown by this command line: Given the previous command line, the compiler produces an executable named . When you run it, it produces the following output: Import the STL library for best performance 555\n\nImport the standard library and global C functions with\n\nThe C++ standard library includes the ISO C standard library. The module provides all of the functionality of the module like , , , , and so on. But it also provides the global namespace versions of these functions such as , , , , and so on.\n\nThe named module is a compatibility layer provided to ease migrating existing code that refers to C runtime functions in the global namespace. If you want to avoid adding names to the global namespace, use . If you need to ease migrating a codebase that uses many unqualified (global namespace) C runtime functions, use . This provides the global namespace C runtime names so that you don't have to qualify all the global names with . If you don't have any existing code that uses the global namespace C runtime functions, then you don't need to use . If you only call a few C runtime functions in your code, it may be better to use and qualify the few global namespace C runtime names that need it with . For example, . If you see an error like when you try to compile your code, consider using to import the global namespace C runtime functions.\n\nExample: How to build and import\n\nBefore you can use you must compile the module interface file found in source code form in . Visual Studio ships the source code for the module so that you can compile the module using the compiler settings that match your project. The steps are similar to for building the named module. The named module is built first because depends on it:\n• None Open a Native Tools Command Prompt for VS: from the Windows Start menu, type x86 native and the prompt should appear in the list of apps. Ensure that the prompt is for Visual Studio 2022 version 17.5 or above. You'll get compiler errors if you use the wrong version of the prompt.\n• None Create a directory to try this example, such as , and make it the current directory. If you choose a directory that you don't have write access to, you'll get errors.\n• None Compile the and named modules with the following command: You should compile and using the same compiler settings that you intend to use with the code that will import them. If you have a multi-project solution, you can compile them once, and then refer to them from all of your projects using the compiler option. If you get errors, ensure that you're using the correct version of the command prompt. The compiler outputs four files from the previous two steps:\n• is the compiled binary named module interface that the compiler consults to process the statement. The compiler also consults to process because builds on . This is a compile-time only artifact. It doesn't ship with your application.\n• contains the implementation of the standard library.\n• is the compiled binary named module interface that the compiler consults to process the statement.

Add to the command line when you compile the sample app to statically link the functionality that you use from the standard library into your application. You can control the object file name and the named module interface file name with the following switches:\n• sets the name of the object file. For example, . By default, the compiler uses the same name for the object file as the module source file ( ) you're compiling. In the example, the object file names are and by default because we're compiling the module files and .\n• sets the name of the named module interface file ( ). For example, . By default, the compiler uses the same name for the module interface file ( ) as the module source file ( ) you're compiling. In the example, the generated files are and by default because we're compiling the module files and .\n• None Import the library by first creating a file named with the following content: import std.compat; int main() { printf(\"Import std.compat to get global names like printf()\n\n\"); std::vector<int> v{5, 5, 5}; for (const auto& e : v) { printf(\"%i\", e); } } In the preceding code, replaces and . The statement makes the standard library and C runtime functions available with one statement. Importing this named module, which includes the C++ standard library and C runtime library global namespace functions, is faster than processing a single like .\n• None Compile the example by using the following command: We didn't have to specify on the command line because the compiler automatically looks for the file that matches the module name in an statement. When the compiler encounters it finds since we put it in the same directory as the source code--relieving us of the need to specify it on the command line. If the file is in a different directory than the source code, or has a different name, use the compiler switch to refer to it. When you import , you must link against both and because uses code in . If you're building a single project, you can combine the steps of building the and standard library named modules by adding and (in that order) to the command line. This tutorial shows building the standard library modules as a separate step because you only need to build the standard library named modules once, and then you can refer to them from your project, or from multiple projects. But if it's convenient to build them all at once, make sure to put them before any files that consume them, and specify to name the built as shown in this example: In this example, compiling the source code and linking the module's implementation into your application are separate steps. They don't have to be. You could use to compile and link in one step. But it may be convenient to build and link separately because then you only need to build the standard library named modules once, and then you can refer to them from your project, or from multiple projects, in your build's link step. The previous compiler command produces an executable named . When you run it, it produces the following output: Import std.compat to get global names like printf() 555\n\nVersioning for named modules is the same as for headers. The named module files are installed alongside the headers, for example: , which resolves to in the version of the tools used at the time of this writing. Select the version of the named module the same way you choose the version of the header file to use--by the directory you refer to them from.\n\nDon't mix and match importing header units and named modules. For example, don't and in the same file.\n\nDon't mix and match importing C++ standard library header files and the named modules or . For example, don't and in the same file. However, you can include C headers and import named modules in the same file. For example, you can and in the same file. Just don't include the C++ standard library version .\n\nYou don't have to defend against importing a module multiple times. That is, you don't need style header guards in modules. The compiler knows when it has already imported a named module and ignores duplicate attempts to do so.\n\nIf you need to use the macro, then .\n\nIf you need to use the macro, . Because named modules don't expose macros, this is the workaround if you need to check for errors from , for example.\n\nMacros such as , , and are defined by , which you can include. However, if you you can use and instead of and , and instead of .\n\nIn this tutorial, you've imported the standard library using modules.

        "document": "An \"environment\" in Python is the context in which a Python program runs that consists of an interpreter and any number of installed packages.\n\nBy default, any Python interpreter installed runs in its own global environment. For example, if you just run , , or at a new terminal (depending on how you installed Python), you're running in that interpreter's global environment. Any packages that you install or uninstall affect the global environment and all programs that you run within it.\n\nThere are two types of environments that you can create for your workspace: virtual and conda. These environments allow you to install packages without affecting other environments, isolating your workspace's package installations.\n\nA virtual environment is a built-in way to create an environment. A virtual environment creates a folder that contains a copy (or symlink) to a specific interpreter. When you install packages into a virtual environment it will end up in this new folder, and thus isolated from other packages used by other workspaces.\n\nA conda environment is a Python environment that's managed using the package manager (see Getting started with conda).Choosing between conda and virtual environments depends on your packaging needs, team standards, etc.\n\nThe following table lists the various tools involved with Python environments:\n\nTo create local environments in VS Code using virtual environments or Anaconda, you can follow these steps: open the Command Palette (⇧⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+P)), search for the Python: Create Environment command, and select it.\n\nThe command presents a list of environment types: Venv or Conda.\n\nIf you are creating an environment using Venv, the command presents a list of interpreters that can be used as a base for the new virtual environment.\n\nIf you are creating an environment using Conda, the command presents a list of Python versions that can be used for your project.\n\nAfter selecting the desired interpreter or Python version, a notification will show the progress of the environment creation and the environment folder will appear in your workspace.\n\nIf you choose to create a virtual environment manually, use the following command (where \".venv\" is the name of the environment folder):\n\nWhen you create a new virtual environment, a prompt will be displayed in VS Code to allow you to select it for the workspace.\n\nThe Python extension automatically detects existing conda environments. We recommend you install a Python interpreter into your conda environment, otherwise one will be installed for you after you select the environment. For example, the following command creates a conda environment named with a Python 3.9 interpreter and several libraries:\n• If you create a new conda environment while VS Code is running, use the refresh icon on the top right of the Python: Select Interpreter window; otherwise you may not find the environment there.\n• To ensure the environment is properly set up from a shell perspective, use an Anaconda prompt and activate the desired environment. Then, you can launch VS Code by entering the command. Once VS Code is open, you can select the interpreter either by using the Command Palette or by clicking on the status bar.\n• Although the Python extension for VS Code doesn't currently have direct integration with conda files, VS Code itself is a great YAML editor.\n• Conda environments can't be automatically activated in the VS Code Integrated Terminal if the default shell is set to PowerShell. To change the shell, see Integrated terminal - Terminal profiles.\n• You can manually specify the path to the executable to use for activation (version 4.4+). To do so, open the Command Palette (⇧⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+P)) and run Preferences: Open User Settings. Then set , which is in the Python extension section of User Settings, with the appropriate path.\n\nThe Python extension tries to find and then select what it deems the best environment for the workspace. If you would prefer to select a specific environment, use the Python: Select Interpreter command from the Command Palette (⇧⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+P)).\n\nThe Python: Select Interpreter command displays a list of available global environments, conda environments, and virtual environments. (See the Where the extension looks for environments section for details, including the distinctions between these types of environments.) The following image, for example, shows several Anaconda and CPython installations along with a conda environment and a virtual environment ( ) that's located within the workspace folder:\n\nIf you have a folder or a workspace open in VS Code and you select an interpreter from the list, the Python extension will store that information internally. This ensures that the same interpreter will be used when you reopen the workspace.\n\nThe selected environment is used by the Python extension for running Python code (using the Python: Run Python File in Terminal command), providing language services (auto-complete, syntax checking, linting, formatting, etc.) when you have a file open in the editor, and opening a terminal with the Terminal: Create New Terminal command. In the latter case, VS Code automatically activates the selected environment.\n\nThe selected interpreter version will show on the right side of the Status Bar.\n\nThe Status Bar also reflects when no interpreter is selected.\n\nIn either case, clicking this area of the Status Bar is a convenient shortcut for the Python: Select Interpreter command.\n\nIf VS Code doesn't automatically locate an interpreter you want to use, you can browse for the interpreter on your file system or provide the path to it manually.\n\nYou can do so by running the Python: Select Interpreter command and select the Enter interpreter path... option that shows on the top of the interpreters list:\n\nYou can then either enter the full path of the Python interpreter directly in the text box (for example, \".venv/Scripts/python.exe\"), or you can select the Find... button and browse your file system to find the python executable you wish to select.\n\nIf you want to manually specify a default interpreter that will be used when you first open your workspace, you can create or modify an entry for the setting.\n\nAdditionally, if you'd like to set up a default interpreter to all of your Python applications, you can add an entry for manually inside your User Settings. To do so, open the Command Palette (⇧⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+P)) and enter Preferences: Open User Settings. Then set , which is in the Python extension section of User Settings, with the appropriate interpreter.\n\nHow the extension chooses an environment automatically\n\nIf an interpreter hasn't been specified, then the Python extension automatically selects the interpreter with the highest version in the following priority order:\n• Virtual environments related to the workspace but stored globally. For example, Pipenv or Poetry environments that are located outside of the workspace folder.\n• Globally installed interpreters. For example, the ones found in , , etc.\n\nIf Visual Studio Code doesn't locate your interpreter automatically, you can manually specify an interpreter.\n\nWhere the extension looks for environments\n\nThe extension automatically looks for interpreters in the following locations, in no particular order:\n• Standard install paths such as , , , , etc.\n• Virtual environments located in the folder identified by the setting (see General Python settings), which can contain multiple virtual environments. The extension looks for virtual environments in the first-level subfolders of .\n• Virtual environments located in the path identified by (as used by virtualenvwrapper).\n• Conda environments found by . Conda environments which do not have an interpreter will have one installed for them upon selection.\n• Interpreters installed in a folder for direnv under the workspace folder.\n\nAfter using Python: Select Interpreter, that interpreter is applied when right-clicking a file and selecting Python: Run Python File in Terminal. The environment is also activated automatically when you use the Terminal: Create New Terminal command unless you change the setting to .\n\nPlease note that launching VS Code from a shell in which a specific Python environment is activated doesn't automatically activate that environment in the default Integrated Terminal.\n\nChanging interpreters with the Python: Select Interpreter command doesn't affect terminal panels that are already open. Thus, you can activate separate environments in a split terminal: select the first interpreter, create a terminal for it, select a different interpreter, then use the split button (⌘\\ (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+5)) in the terminal title bar.\n\nBy default, the debugger will use the Python interpreter chosen with the Python extension. However, if there is a property specified in the debug configuration of , it takes precedence. If this property is not defined, it will fall back to using the Python interpreter path selected for the workspace.\n\nFor more details on debug configuration, see Debugging configurations.\n\nAn environment variable definitions file is a text file containing key-value pairs in the form of , with used for comments. Multiline values aren't supported, but references to previously defined environment variables are allowed. Environment variable definitions files can be used for scenarios such as debugging and tool execution (including linters, formatters, IntelliSense, and testing tools), but aren't applied to the terminal.\n\nBy default, the Python extension looks for and loads a file named in the current workspace folder, then applies those definitions. The file is identified by the default entry in your user settings (see General Python settings). You can change the setting at any time to use a different definitions file.\n\nA debug configuration also contains an property that also defaults to the file in the current workspace (see Debugging - Set configuration options). This property allows you to easily set variables for debugging purposes that replace variables specified in the default file.\n\nFor example, when developing a web application, you might want to easily switch between development and production servers. Instead of coding the different URLs and other settings into your application directly, you could use separate definitions files for each. For example:\n\nYou can then set the setting to , then set the property in the debug configuration to .\n\nUse of the PYTHONPATH variable\n\nThe PYTHONPATH environment variable specifies additional locations where the Python interpreter should look for modules. In VS Code, PYTHONPATH can be set through the terminal settings ( ) and/or within an file.\n\nWhen the terminal settings are used, PYTHONPATH affects any tools that are run within the terminal by a user, as well as any action the extension performs for a user that is routed through the terminal such as debugging. However, in this case when the extension is performing an action that isn't routed through the terminal, such as the use of a linter or formatter, then this setting won't have an effect on module look-up.\n• Editing code - Learn about autocomplete, IntelliSense, formatting, and refactoring for Python.\n• Debugging - Learn to debug Python both locally and remotely.\n• Settings reference - Explore the full range of Python-related settings in VS Code.\n• Getting Started with Python in VS Code - Learn how to edit, run, and debug code in VS Code.\n• Virtual Environments and Packages (Python.org) - Learn more about virtual environments and packages.\n• Python tutorial (Python.org) - Learn more about the Python language."

        "document": "A Python environment is a context in which you run Python code and includes global, virtual, and conda environments. An environment consists of an interpreter, a library (typically the Python Standard Library), and a set of installed packages. These components together determine valid language constructs and syntax, operating-system functionality that you can access, and packages you can use.\n\nIn Visual Studio on Windows, you use the Python Environments window, as described in this article, to manage environments and select one as the default for new projects. Other aspects of environments are found in the following articles:\n• None For any given project, you can select a specific environment rather than use the default.\n• None For details on creating and using virtual environments for Python projects, see Use virtual environments.\n• None If you want to install packages in an environment, refer to the Packages tab reference.\n• None To install another Python interpreter, see Install Python interpreters. In general, if you download and run an installer for a mainline Python distribution, Visual Studio detects that new installation and the environment appears in the Python Environments window and can be selected for projects.\n\nIf you're new to Python in Visual Studio, see the following articles for general background:\n\nThe environments that Visual Studio knows about are displayed in the Python Environments window. To open the window, use one of the following methods:\n• Right-click the Python Environments node for a project in Solution Explorer and select View All Python Environments.\n\nVisual Studio looks for installed global environments by using the registry (following PEP 514), along with virtual environments and conda environments (see Types of environments). If you don't see an expected environment in the list, see Manually identify an existing environment.\n\nWhen you select an environment in the list, Visual Studio displays various properties and commands for that environment on the Overview tab of the Python Environments window, such as the interpreter location. The commands at the bottom of the Overview tab each open a command prompt with the interpreter running. For more information, see Python Environments window tab reference - Overview.\n\nUse the dropdown list under the list of environments to switch to different tabs such as Packages and IntelliSense. These tabs are also described in the Python Environments window tab reference.\n\nSelecting an environment doesn't change its relation to any projects. The default environment, shown in boldface in the list, is the one that Visual Studio uses for any new projects. To use a different environment with new projects, use the Make this the default environment for new projects command. Within the context of a project, you can always select a specific environment. For more information, see Select an environment for a project.\n\nTo the right of each listed environment, is a control that opens an Interactive window for that environment. (In Visual Studio 2017 15.5 and earlier, another control appears that refreshes the IntelliSense database for that environment. For details about the database, see Python Environments window tab reference.)\n\nWhat if no environments appear?\n\nIf you don't see any environments in the Python Environments window, it means Visual Studio failed to detect any Python installations in standard locations. Maybe you installed Visual Studio 2017 or later but cleared all the interpreter options in the installer options for the Python workload. Similarly, you possibly installed Visual Studio 2015 or earlier but didn't install an interpreter manually. For more information, see Install Python interpreters.\n\nIf you know you have a Python interpreter on your computer but Visual Studio (any version) didn't detect it, use the + Custom command to specify the interpreter location manually. For more information, see how to manually identify an existing environment.\n\nVisual Studio can work with global, virtual, and conda environments.\n\nEach Python installation maintains its own global environment. For example, Python 2.7, Python 3.6, Python 3.7, Anaconda 4.4.0, and so on. For more information, see Install Python interpreters.\n\nEach environment is composed of the specific Python interpreter, its standard library, and a set of preinstalled packages. It also contains any other packages you install while the environment is activated. Installing a package into a global environment makes it available to all projects using that environment. If the environment is located in a protected area of the file system (within c:\\program files, for example), then installing packages requires administrator privileges.\n\nGlobal environments are available to all projects on the computer. In Visual Studio, you select one global environment as the default, which is used for all projects unless you specifically choose a different one for a project. For more information, see Select an environment for a project.\n\nWorking in a global environment is an easy way to get started. Over time, environments can become cluttered with many different packages installed for different projects. The clutter can make it difficult to thoroughly test your application against a specific set of packages with known versions. But this kind of environment is what you would expect to set up on a build server or web server. Conflicts can also occur when two projects require incompatible packages or different versions of the same package.\n\nFor these reasons, developers often create a virtual environment for a project. A virtual environment is a subfolder in a project that contains a copy of a specific interpreter. If you activate the virtual environment, any packages you install are installed only in that environment's subfolder. When you run a Python program within the virtual environment, you can be confident that the program is running against only those specific packages.\n\nVisual Studio provides direct support for creating a virtual environment for a project. If you open a project that contains a file, Visual Studio prompts you automatically to create a virtual environment and install those dependencies. You see the same behavior when you create a project from a template that includes file.\n\nAt any time within an open project, you can create a new virtual environment. In Solution Explorer, expand the project node, right-click Python Environments, and choose Add environment. In Add Environment, choose Virtual environment. For more information, see Create a virtual environment.\n\nVisual Studio also provides a command to generate a file from a virtual environment, making it easy to recreate the environment on other computers. For more information, see Use virtual environments.\n\nYou can create a conda environment by using the tool, or with integrated conda management in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7 and later. A conda environment requires Anaconda or Miniconda. These platforms are available through the Visual Studio Installer. For more information, see Install Python support in Visual Studio.\n• None In the Python Environments window (or from the Python toolbar), select Add Environment to open the Add environment dialog.\n• None In the Add environment dialog, select the Conda environment tab:\n• Identifies the project in which to create the environment. Provides the name for the conda environment. Specifies how to add packages to the conda environment. \n\n - Environment file: Select this option if you have an file that describes your dependencies. Enter the name of the file or browse (...) to the file location and select the file. \n\n - One or more Anaconda package names: Select this option if you want to list one or more Python packages or Python versions. \n\n\n\n The package list instructs conda to create a Python environment. To install the latest version of Python, use the command. To install a specific version, use the command as in . You can also use the package button to select Python versions and common packages from a series of menus. Activates the new environment in the selected project after the environment is created. Set as default environment for new projects Automatically sets and activates the conda environment in any new projects created in Visual Studio. This option is the same as using the Make this the default environment for new projects in the Python Environments window. Specifies whether to show the Python Environments window after creating the environment. When you create a conda environment, be sure to specify at least one Python version or Python package to ensure the environment contains a Python runtime. You can use an file or the package list. If you don't provide this specification, Visual Studio ignores the environment. The environment doesn't appear anywhere in the Python Environments window, it's not set as the current environment for a project, and it's not available as a global environment. If you happen to create a conda environment without a Python version, use the command to see the locations of conda environment folders. You can then manually remove the subfolder for the environment from that location.\n• You can monitor creation of the conda environment in the Output window. After creation completes, the output displays some command-line interface (CLI) instructions, such as :\n• None In Visual Studio, you can activate a conda environment for your project in the same way that you would any other environment. For more information, see Select an environment for a project.\n• None To install more packages in the environment, use the Packages tab on the Python Environments window.\n\nTo see the conda version, where conda environments are stored, and other information, run the command at an Anaconda command prompt (a command prompt where Anaconda is in the path):\n\nYour conda environment folders appear as follows:\n\nBecause conda environments aren't stored with a project, they behave similarly to global environments. For example, installing a new package into a conda environment makes that package available to all projects that use the environment.\n\nFor Visual Studio 2017 version 15.6 and earlier, you can use conda environments by pointing to them manually as described in Manually identify an existing environment.\n\nVisual Studio 2017 version 15.7 and later detects conda environments automatically and displays them in the Python Environments window as described in the next section.\n\nUse the following steps to identify an environment installed in a nonstandard location.\n• None In the Python Environments window (or from the Python toolbar), select Add Environment to open the Add environment dialog.\n• None In the Add environment dialog, on the Existing environment tab, set the Environment field to <Custom>: After you select the <Custom> value, more fields are added to the dialog.\n• None Set the Prefix path field to the path of the interpreter. You can set the field by browsing (...) to the path location.\n• None After you select the path, the remaining fields are populated. Review the values and modify as needed. When you're ready, select Add.\n\nYou can also review and modify details of the environment at any time in the Python Environments window.\n• None In the Python Environments window, select the environment, and then select the Configure tab.\n• None After you make changes, select the Apply command.\n\nYou can also remove the environment by using the Remove command. For more information, see Configure tab. This command isn't available for autodetected environments.\n\nIf Visual Studio finds registry entries for an environment, but the path to the interpreter is invalid, then the Python Environments window shows the environment name in a strikeout font format as shown in the following image:\n\nTo correct an environment that you want to keep, first try using the environment installer's Repair process. Most installers include a repair option.\n\nModify the registry to correct an environment\n\nIf the Python environment doesn't have a repair option, or you want to remove an invalid environment, you can use the following steps to modify the registry directly. Visual Studio automatically updates thePython Environments window when you make changes to the registry.\n• None Run the executable to open the Registry editor.\n• None Browse to the environment folder that corresponds to your configuration:\n• None Expand the distribution and version node structure for your environment:\n• None Inspect the values under the InstallPath node:\n• If the environment still exists on your computer, change the value of the ExecutablePath entry to the correct location. Also correct the values for the (Default) and WindowedExecutablePath entries, as necessary.\n• If the environment no longer exists on your computer and you want to remove it from the Python Environments window, delete the version number parent node of the InstallPath node. You can see an example of this node in the preceding image. In the example, this node is 3.6. Invalid settings in the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Python key override the settings in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Python key.\n\nTo remove a Python project, browse to the Python environment in Solution Explorer. Right-click the Python environment that you want to remove, and select Remove.\n\nIf you want to keep the Python environment but remove it from your project, select Remove. If you want to delete the environment permanently, select Delete."
