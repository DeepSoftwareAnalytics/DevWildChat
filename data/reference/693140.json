        "document": "The Script is used to model the behaviour of a Gaussian beam propagating in the Z direction with spherical wavefronts in the paraxial region. The beam is specified by its wavelength (visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum), power and the value of its waist. Also, the XY and XZ planes for the irradiance calculations and plots are also specified in the INPUT Section of the Script. The following parameters are computed in the CALCULATION Section of the Script: the Z axis grid,ï¿½ ï¿½[m]; Rayleigh range,ï¿½ ï¿½[m]; the ratio, ; beam divergence angle, ; beam spot size, ï¿½[m]; Gouy phase angle, ; axial irradiance ( ), ; radial irradiance (XY plane at ), ï¿½and ; irradiance displayed in XZ plane, ; phase, . The calculation outputs are displayed in a series of Figure Windows.ï¿½ For different simulations, most of the parameters only need to be changed in the INPUT Section of the Script. The Script calls ColorCode.m which assigns the color of a plot to the wavelength color. Lasers are widely used in many fields today. Having a mathematical description of laser light is essential. The light emitted from a laser is composed of a narrow band of wavelengths, such that we can assume the light is monochromatic. The light emitted from the laser is usually collimated as it propagates in a straight line as a narrow beam. As a starting point, we will assume the beam to be unpolarized and the light intensity to have a Gaussian profile in any plane that is normal to the direction of propagation. This mode is referred to as the TEM mode and it describes the output of most lasers. Fig. 1.ï¿½ï¿½ Red light emitted from a HeNe laser. The light is seen due to scattering. The light propagates as a collimated beam in a straight line with slight divergence in its cross-section. ï¿½The light emitted from a laser can be modelled by solving the [3D] scalar wave equation for the electric field ï¿½ We will assume that a monochromatic beam with a circular cross-section propagates in free spaces and that the electric field can be expressed as a product of its spatial part and time dependent part Substitution of equation 2 into equation 1 gives the Helmholtz equation We will only consider the solution for a wave propagating in the Z direction where The term ï¿½accounts for the wave oscillation along the propagation direction. Substitution of equation 4 into equation 3 gives We will assume that there is a slow decrease in the amplitude of the wave as the wave propagates in the Z direction and only consider the wave far from the origin but close to the Z axis such that ï¿½and . Thus, we can say that ï¿½varies slowly with z, and thus we can neglect the term .ï¿½ Therefore, the wave equation can be expressed as This is known as the paraxial wave equation. Without going into all the mathematical details, a solution to paraxial wave equation is ï¿½is the amplitude of the wave. ï¿½is the radius of the beam at position z at which the amplitude has decreased by the factor 1/e from its axial value or where the irradiance is 1/e2 of its axial value. ï¿½is known as the beam spot. ï¿½is the radius of curvature of the wavefront (surface that contains all points of the wave that have the same phase) at position z.ï¿½ As the beam propagates in the +Z direction, the width of the beam expands, and this is measured by the beam spot as it increases with z. For the expanding beam, its wavefront must have a spherical shape because a wave always propagates in a direction perpendicular to its wavefront. The paraxial approximation is only valid when ï¿½and is not accurate for strongly diverging beams. We can better understand the solution of the scalar paraxial wave equation by running the Script op_beams_001.m with the following input parameters: % Length of Z domain in multiples of zR :ï¿½ z = nZ * zR % Number of grid points in calculationsï¿½ (must be an odd number) All the figures in this document where created using the script op_beams_001.m. At position z along the axis, the beam spot ï¿½parameters is given by When z = 0, we have . This the smallest value that ï¿½can have. Thus, z = 0 is a special point in the propagation of the beam. For z > 0 the beam spot increases. Also, in the negative Z direction the beam spot also increases. When the beam is focused by a lens there is always a minimum width of the beam at the focal point such that the beam spot is equal to the value of the waist . It is important to note that the Raleigh range is an indicator of the divergence of the beam. When ï¿½we have . This is a turning point in the propagation of the light as the beam spot makes the transition from being nearly constant to increasing linearly as shown in figure 2. When ï¿½the ray description of the propagation of the light breaks down as the beam spot slowly increases. When , the beam spot expands linearly as where ï¿½is the limiting value of the divergence and is called the divergence angle of the beam.ï¿½ The magenta line in figure 2 shows the divergence of the beam for . Note: the smaller the value of ï¿½the quicker the beam will expand in a linear manner and the smaller the value of the waist, the larger the divergence angle of the beam. Because the divergence is inversely proportional to the spot size, for a given wavelength , a Gaussian beam that is focused to a small spot diverges rapidly as it propagates away from the focus. Conversely, to minimize the divergence of a laser beam in the far field (and increase its peak intensity at large distances) it must have a large cross-section ( ) at the waist and thus a large diameter where it is launched, since . This relationship between beam width and divergence is a fundamental characteristic of diffraction, and of the Fourier transform which describes Fraunhofer diffraction. Since the Gaussian beam model uses the paraxial approximation, it fails when wavefronts are tilted by more than about 30ï¿½ from the axis of the beam. From the above expression for divergence, this means the Gaussian beam model is only accurate for beams with waists where . The shape of a Gaussian beam of a given wavelength ï¿½is governed solely by one parameter, the beam waist . This is a measure of the beam size at the point of its focus ( ) and corresponds to the smallest value of the beam spot parameter. From waist , other parameters describing the beam geometry are determined, such as, the Rayleigh range ï¿½and asymptotic beam divergence . Radius of curvature of the wavefrontï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ gives the curvature of the wavefront which is spherical with radius .ï¿½ Figure 3 shows the variation in the radius of curvature ï¿½as a function of z. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Fig.3.ï¿½ï¿½ Radius of curvature of the wavefront as a function of z. When z = 0 we have , the wavefront is a plane wave and at this point all parts of the wave are moving in the same direction. When , then . The wavefront is a nearly a spherical surface traveling away from z = 0. This is the geometric optics limit. When we focus a beam of light we expect the light rays to go in straight lines to and from the focal point (z = 0). This is correct if . For , the wave aspect of the light applies. When ï¿½then ï¿½which is the minimum value of the radius of curvature and corresponds to the turning point between ray-optics and wave-optics. The Gouy phase slightly shifts the phase of the wavefront of the wave as a whole. For a focused beam, the dependence of the Gouy phase as a function of z is displayed in figure 4. As ï¿½the Gouy phase asymptotes to . Thus, only a phase shift occurs from ï¿½to . This results in inversion of a signal that has passed through the waist , that corresponds to the inversion obtained with the ray-tracing approximation (Geometrical Optics). ï¿½The most rapid change in phase occurs in the region from to ï¿½and when , then ï¿½and , then .ï¿½ The Gouy phase shift along the beam remains within the range ï¿½(for a fundamental Gaussian beam) and is not observable in most experiments. However, it is of theoretical importance and takes on a greater range for higher-order Gaussian modes. The irradiance (intensity) S is the time average flow of energy per unit time per unit area [W.m-2]. The irradiance S can be calculated from the electric field E of the wave from equation 14 The symbol S is used for the irradiance in the Script and notes and not the more commonly used letter I. c is the speed of light and ï¿½is the permittivity of free space. For our propagating Gaussian beam, the electric field E is given by equation 7, so the irradiance S is The maximum irradiance occurs at the location ï¿½where The variation of the intensity along the Z axis ï¿½is given by Figure 5 shows a plot of the axial irradiance S as a function of z. Fig. 5.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Axial irradiance ï¿½as a function of position z along the axis of the beam. The maximum value of the irradiance from equation 15C isï¿½ . Note, at ï¿½the on-axis irradiance is one-half the maximum irradiance at the waist : .ï¿½ When , then ï¿½and . Therefore, the amplitude of the wave decreases with increasing z in the same manner as a spherical wave.ï¿½ï¿½ The radial irradiance S is the variation in the irradiance in the XY plane located at position z. and typical plots are shown in figure 6. Fig. 6.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The variation in the radial irradiance Sï¿½ at two z positions along the axis. The profile of the plots are also a Gaussian function as is the amplitude of the wave. Figure 7 shows the radial irradiance S as a [3D] plot and as image that may be viewed on a screen for the same two z positions as in figure 6. Figure 8 shows the beam in the XZ plane and how the beam diverges and how its intensity decreases with increasing z distance from the waist at z = 0. Fig. 8.ï¿½ï¿½ Profile of the beam in the XZ plane. The yellow lines show the beam spot as shown in figure 2.ï¿½ï¿½ The power P transmitted through a circular disk of radius r in an XY plane at position z is If we know the total power ï¿½transmitted by the beam, we can then calculate the electric field amplitude ï¿½and the maximum irradianceï¿½ of the beam Figure 9 shows the percentage power that would pass through a circular aperture of varying radius placed perpendicular to the beam at the beam waist. Fig. 9.ï¿½ï¿½ The percentage power that would pass through a circular aperture of varying radius placed perpendicular to the beam at the beam waist. 86% of the light passes through the aperture when the radius of the aperture is equal to the beam waist. We can examine the change of phase of the wave along the time Z axis from equation 7 when ï¿½and . The phase of the wave can be found using the Matlab command angle ï¿½ï¿½ % phase of the wave along the Z axis The phase along the Z axis is displayed in figure 10.

The corresponding propagation angles (measured against the normal direction) are <$\\theta_1$> and <$\\theta_2$> (see Figure 1).\n\nFor example, the amplitude transmission coefficient is <$t_\\textrm{s}$> for s polarization, i.e., if the electric field vector is perpendicular to the plane of incidence.\n\nThe power reflection coefficients (reflectivity or reflectance values) are obtained simply by taking the modulus squared of the corresponding amplitude coefficients. For the transmissivity, one must add a factor <$(n_2 \\cos \\theta_2) / (n_1 \\cos \\theta_1)$> to take into account the different propagation angles.\n\nFigure 2 shows in an example case how the reflectivity of the interface depends on the angle of incidence and the polarization. The reflection coefficient vanishes for p polarization if the angle of incidence is Brewster's angle (here: ≈55.4°).\n\nFor the simplest case with normal incidence on the interface, the power reflectivity (which is the modulus squared of the amplitude reflectivity) can be calculated with the following equation:\n\nFresnel equations can also be applied to absorbing media, including metals. In that case, a complex refractive index needs to be used; the imaginary part is related to the absorbance. The reflection and transmission coefficients are then generally no more real numbers.\n\nA difficulty occurs concerning the calculation of power transmission for absorbing media in cases with non-normal incidence. The above-mentioned correction factor for taking into account the different propagation angles will be complex, but the power transmission factor would of course have to be a real number. The problem is related to the fact that the optical intensity is no longer constant along the wavefronts.\n\nIn practice, Fresnel equations may not completely describe the optical properties of an interface since the surface quality is not high enough. For example, surface irregularities even only on a sub-micrometer scale may lead to substantial irregular wavefront distortions. However, very high optical quality can be achieved with careful surface preparation. For example, the optical quality is generally excellent when optical contact bonding is applied. There are also other methods for making optical contacts.\n\nHere you can submit questions and comments.
