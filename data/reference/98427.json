It is commonly referred to as the \"disk destroyer\", “data definition”, “disk dump”, or \"disk duplicator\" due to its immense power and ability to directly interact with block devices. In this beginner's guide, we will explore the dd command, its syntax, and various use cases, highlighting its role in file copying, disk partition backup, and restoration, and creating bootable USB drives.\n\nThe syntax of the dd command is simple. It reads from standard input and writes to standard output by default. Here is the basic syntax of the dd command:\n\nIt's worth noting that dd deviates from the standard convention of using the or syntax for options, distinguishing it from most Linux shell commands.\n\nThe dd command accepts several options to customize its behavior and achieve specific tasks. Here are some of the most commonly used options:\n\nNow, let's explore some practical examples of using the dd command in various scenarios.\n\nHow to copy files in Linux\n\nTo make a simple copy of a file, you can use the dd command with the and options. For example, to copy a file named to a new file named , run the following command:\n\nThis command reads the contents of and writes them to .\n\nWhen using the dd command, if there is already a file with the same name at the destination, it will be replaced by default. This means that the existing file will be overwritten. Use the option to prevent overwriting an existing file while using the dd command. This option ensures that the destination file is not truncated during the write process. For example:\n\nIn addition to avoiding overwriting, you can also append data to an existing file by using the option. Let's consider an example where we want to append the contents of to :\n\nWith this command, the dd command reads the data from and appends it to the end of .\n\nThe dd command can also be used to perform text conversions. For instance, to convert all the text in a file from lowercase to uppercase, use the option with the and conversion parameters. Consider the following example:\n\nThis command reads the contents of , converts all lowercase characters to uppercase, and saves the result in .\n\nSimilarly, you can convert text from uppercase to lowercase using the option with the and conversion parameters. Here's an example:\n\nOne of the powerful use cases of the dd command is creating backups of disk partitions. This can be particularly useful for system administrators or users who want to preserve the state of their disk partitions. To back up a disk partition, you need to identify the block device associated with the partition, usually represented by a device file in the directory.\n\nFor example, to back up the first partition of the disk located at , you would use the following command:\n\nThis command reads the content of , the first partition of the disk, and saves it to a file named .\n\nOnce you have a backup of a disk partition, you can use the dd command to restore it when needed. To restore a disk partition, you would reverse the input and output files in the command. Here's an example:\n\nThis command reads the content from the file and writes it to the partition, effectively restoring the partition to its previous state.\n\nIn addition to backing up individual partitions, you can use the dd command to create a backup of the entire Linux hard drive. This allows you to capture the complete state of the disk, including all partitions, boot records, and file systems.\n\nTo back up the entire hard drive, you would specify the hard drive's block device as the input file. For instance, to back up the hard drive located at , run the following command:\n\nThis command reads the entire content of and saves it to a file named .\n\nSimilarly, you can use the dd command to restore a previously created backup of the entire Linux hard drive. This can be extremely useful in situations where you need to recover the whole system from a backup.\n\nTo restore the hard drive, you would reverse the input and output files in the command. For example:\n\nThis command reads the content from the file and writes it back to the hard drive, effectively restoring the entire system.\n\nThe Master Boot Record (MBR) is a crucial component of a disk that contains the boot loader and partition table. By using the dd command, you can create a backup of the MBR, ensuring that you can recover the boot sector if it gets corrupted or overwritten.\n\nTo back up the MBR, you can use the dd command to copy the first 512 bytes of the disk. Here's an example:\n\nIn this command, specifies the disk from which to read the MBR, specifies the output file to save the backup, sets the block size to 512 bytes (the size of the MBR), and specifies that only one block should be copied.\n\nIf you need to restore the MBR from a backup, you can use the dd command to write the contents of the backup file back to the disk. Here's an example:\n\nThis command reads the content from the file and writes it back to the disk, effectively restoring the MBR.\n\nThe dd command can also be used to create a bit-by-bit copy of a CD or DVD. This can be useful when you want to create an exact replica of the disc, including its file system and bootable properties.\n\nTo copy the contents of a CD/DVD drive, you would specify the CD/DVD drive as the input file ( ) and an output file to save the copy. Here's an example:\n\nIn this command, represents the CD/DVD drive, and is the output file where the copied data will be saved.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, one common use of the dd command is disk cloning. By copying block devices byte by byte, dd creates an exact replica of a disk. When cloning a disk to a file, we can enhance the result and reduce the file size by piping the data read by dd through compression utilities like gzip. For example, to create a clone of the entire block device, we can execute the following command:\n\nIn this example, we specify that dd should read from the device and adjust the block size to 1M for improved performance. We then pipe the data to the gzip program, utilizing the option to output to stdout and the option for maximum compression. Finally, we redirect the output to the \" \" file.\n\nSkipping Bytes or Characters When Reading the Input File\n\nThe dd command provides the option, which allows you to skip a specific number of bytes or characters while reading the input file. This can be useful when you need to exclude certain parts of the file. Here's an example:\n\nIn this command, the dd command skips the first 100 bytes of data in and writes the remaining content to .\n\nAnother valuable use case for dd is wiping a device. There are various situations where such an operation becomes necessary, such as preparing a disk for sale to ensure the previous data has been completely erased for privacy reasons or wiping data before setting up encryption. In the former case, overwriting the disk with zeros is sufficient:\n\nWith this command, dd reads from the device, which provides null characters, and writes them to the target device until it is completely filled.\n\nWhen setting up an encryption layer on our system, it is advisable to fill the disk with random data instead. This step renders the sectors that will contain data indistinguishable from the empty ones, thus preventing potential metadata leaks. In this scenario, we can read data from either the or devices:\n\nBoth commands will require a significant amount of time to complete, depending on the size and type of the block device and the source of random data used. It's worth noting that /dev/random is slower as it blocks until it gathers sufficient environmental noise, but it produces higher-quality random data compared to\n\nThe dd command is widely used for creating bootable USB drives from ISO images. This is particularly useful when installing or booting operating systems or live distributions from a USB device.\n\nTo create a bootable USB drive, you would specify the ISO file as the input file ( ) and the USB drive as the output file ( ). Here's an example:\n\nIn this command, represents the ISO image of the Linux distribution, is the USB drive (replace with the appropriate drive letter), sets the block size to 4 megabytes for faster copying, and displays the progress of the dd command.\n\nBy using the option with the dd command, you can display a progress bar that indicates the completion percentage of the ongoing operation. This can be helpful, especially when dealing with large files or lengthy processes.\n\nFor example, to copy a file and show the progress bar, use the following command:\n\nThis command reads the content from the and writes it to the , while displaying a progress bar.\n\nIn this tutorial, we learned how to use the dd command. We also covered some practical use cases, such as creating backups and bootable USB sticks, Because dd is a very powerful utility, it must be used with extreme caution: simply switching the input and output targets can, in some cases, destroy data on a disk.\n\nRemember to refer to the official documentation and additional resources to further expand your knowledge and explore advanced usage scenarios.\n\nBe sure to follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nFollow Kubesimplify on Hashnode, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

        "document": "The dd command in Linux is a powerful utility for low-level data copying and conversion, primarily used for disk cloning, creating disk images, partition backups, and writing ISO files to USB drives. Mastering the dd command is essential for Linux system administrators, as it enables precise control over data manipulation, backup processes, and disk recovery.\n\nThis guide will demonstrate how to use the dd command for disk cloning, data backup, and creating bootable media. You’ll also learn to handle common options like bs and conv to customize your data copying process effectively.\n\nWhat is the Command in Linux\n\nThe command in Linux is a command-line tool used for copying and converting data at a low level. It can be used to duplicate entire disks, create disk images, back up partitions, and even write files like ISO images to USB drives. It works with raw data and is highly flexible, which makes it one of the most versatile tools for system administrators.\n\nThe command operates by copying data byte-by-byte, giving you the ability to control the copying process down to the smallest level. This feature makes it ideal for tasks like creating exact backups of your disk partitions and cloning entire disks.\n\nBelow is the syntax for “dd command” in Linux:\n• options : is an additional flags and parameters to modify the operation\n\nThe command` has several options that can be used to modify the data copy process. Here are some important options:\n\nThe command line syntax of dd differs from many other Unix programs, in that it uses the syntax option=value for its command line options, rather than the more standard -option value or –option=value formats. By default, dd reads from stdin and writes to stdout, but these can be changed by using the if (input file) and of (output file) options.\n\nPractical Use Cases for the dd command\n\nThe is versatile and can be used for several key tasks in Linux:\n\nTo backup an entire copy of a hard disk to another hard disk connected to the same system, execute the dd command as shown. In this dd command example, the UNIX device name of the source hard disk is /dev/hda, and device name of the target hard disk is /dev/hdb.\n• if stands for “input file,” and of stands for “output file.” In this example, it copies all data from /dev/sda /dev/sdb\n• None The command creates an exact copy of /dev/sda /dev/sdb\n• None If there are any errors, the above command will fail. If you give the parameter “conv=noerror” then it will continue to copy if there are read errors.\n• None Input file and output file should be mentioned very carefully. Just in case, you mention source device in the target and vice versa, you might loss all your data.\n• None To copy, hard drive to hard drive using dd command given below, sync option allows you to copy everything using synchronized I/O.\n\nYou can use the device name of a partition in the input file, and in the output either you can specify your target path or image file as shown in the dd command.\n\n3. To Create An Image of a Hard Disk\n\nInstead of taking a backup of the hard disk, you can create an image file of the hard disk and save it in other storage devices. There are many advantages of backing up your data to a disk image, one being the ease of use.\n\nThis method is typically faster than other types of backups, enabling you to quickly restore data following an unexpected catastrophe.It creates the image of a hard disk /dev/hda.\n\n4. To Restore Using the Hard Disk Image\n\nTo restore a hard disk with the image file of an another hard disk, the following dd command can be used\n\nThe image file hdadisk.img file, is the image of a /dev/hda, so the above command will restore the image of /dev/hda to /dev/hdb.\n\ndd command allows you to create an iso file from a source file. So we can insert the CD and enter dd command to create an iso file of a CD content.\n\ndd command reads one block of input and process it and writes it into an output file. You can specify the block size for input and output file. In the above dd command example, the parameter “bs” specifies the block size for the both the input and output file. So dd uses 2048bytes as a block size in the above command.\n\nThe in Linux is a powerful utility for disk cloning, data backup, creating bootable USB drives, and many more advanced operations. By understanding its syntax and options, you can easily manage your system’s data and create disk images, partition backups, and restore systems. Although dd is a simple command, it must be used carefully to avoid data loss, especially when dealing with low-level system components like hard drives and partitions.\n\nWhat does the bs option do in the dd command?\n\nWhat does the\n\nHow can I use dd to create a bootable USB drive?\n\nWhat is the difference between conv=noerror and sync in dd?"

        "document": "Ever found yourself in a situation where you needed to copy or convert files in Linux? You’re not alone. Many users find themselves needing to perform these tasks, but aren’t sure where to start.\n\nThink of the ‘dd’ command as a multi-tool in the Linux toolbox. It’s a versatile command that can handle a variety of tasks, from copying and converting files, to creating disk images and more.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll walk you through the use of the ‘dd’ command in Linux, from basic usage to advanced techniques. We’ll cover everything from the basics of the command, to more advanced uses like creating disk images and copying data between devices.\n\nSo, let’s dive in and start mastering the ‘dd’ command in Linux!\n\nTL;DR: How Do I Use the dd Command in Linux?\n\nA simple usage of the ‘dd’ command can be seen in the following example:\n\nIn this example, the ‘dd’ command copies the content from ‘hello.txt’ to ‘world.txt’. The ‘if’ stands for ‘input file’, and ‘of’ stands for ‘output file’. This is a basic use case of the ‘dd’ command in Linux.\n\nGetting Started with the DD Command in Linux\n\nThe ‘dd’ command in Linux is a robust tool that can be used to copy and convert files. In its simplest form, the ‘dd’ command requires two primary arguments: ‘if’, the input file, and ‘of’, the output file. Here’s a basic example of how to use the ‘dd’ command:\n\nIn this example, the ‘dd’ command copies the content from ‘source.txt’ to ‘destination.txt’. If ‘destination.txt’ doesn’t exist, the ‘dd’ command will create it. If it does exist, it will be overwritten.\n\nThe ‘dd’ command is powerful, but it’s also risky. Since it can overwrite files without warning, it’s crucial to double-check your commands before executing them.\n\nOne of the advantages of the ‘dd’ command is its versatility. It can be used to copy and convert files, create disk images, and even wipe disks. However, with this power comes the potential for pitfalls. For example, using the wrong input or output file can result in data loss. Always use the ‘dd’ command with caution, and make sure you have a good understanding of what your command will do before pressing enter.\n\nExploring Advanced Features of the DD Command in Linux\n\nAs you grow more comfortable with the basic usage of the ‘dd’ command, you might find yourself curious about its more advanced features. The ‘dd’ command in Linux is incredibly flexible, capable of handling more complex tasks such as creating disk images, copying data between devices, and converting data formats.\n\nBefore we dive into these advanced uses, let’s familiarize ourselves with some command-line arguments or flags that can modify the behavior of the ‘dd’ command. Here’s a table of some commonly used ‘dd’ arguments:\n\nNow that we have a basic understanding of ‘dd’ command line arguments, let’s dive deeper into the advanced use of ‘dd’.\n\nExploring Alternatives to the DD Command in Linux\n\nWhile ‘dd’ is an incredibly powerful command, it’s not the only tool available in Linux for copying and converting files. Other commands such as ‘cat’, ‘cp’, and ‘rsync’ can also be used to perform tasks similar to those accomplished with ‘dd’. Let’s take a closer look at these alternatives.\n\nThe ‘cat’ command, short for concatenate, can be used to display file contents, combine files, and create new ones. Here’s an example of how you can use ‘cat’ to copy a file:\n\nIn the above example, ‘cat’ reads the file ‘source.txt’ and the ‘>’ operator redirects the output to ‘destination.txt’. If ‘destination.txt’ doesn’t exist, it’s created. If it does exist, it’s overwritten.\n\nThe ‘cp’ command is a straightforward method to copy files and directories. Here’s how you can use it:\n\nThe ‘cp’ command in the above example copies ‘source.txt’ to ‘destination.txt’. Like ‘cat’, if ‘destination.txt’ doesn’t exist, it’s created. If it does exist, it’s overwritten.\n\nThe ‘rsync’ command is a fast and versatile tool that synchronizes files and directories between two locations. Here’s a basic use case:\n\nIn the above example, ‘rsync’ copies ‘source.txt’ to ‘destination.txt’. The ‘-a’ flag is for archive mode, which ensures that symbolic links, devices, attributes, permissions, ownerships, etc. are preserved in the transfer.\n\nEach of these commands has its advantages and disadvantages. While ‘cat’ and ‘cp’ are simpler to use, they lack the advanced features and versatility of ‘dd’. On the other hand, ‘rsync’ is more robust and offers features like incremental file transfer and remote file copying, but it can be more complex to use.\n\nIn conclusion, while ‘dd’ is a powerful tool, there are several alternatives each with their own strengths. Depending on your specific needs, ‘cat’, ‘cp’, or ‘rsync’ might be more appropriate. As always, remember to use these commands with caution to avoid data loss.\n\nWhile ‘dd’ is a powerful tool, like any command, it’s not without its potential issues. Here, we’ll explore some common problems you might encounter while using ‘dd’, and provide solutions and workarounds.\n\nOne common issue with ‘dd’ is data corruption. This can occur if the system crashes or loses power during a ‘dd’ operation. Here’s an example of how you might use ‘dd’ to create a backup, which could be at risk for corruption:\n\nIn this example, we’re creating a backup image of the ‘/dev/sda’ disk. If the system were to crash during this operation, the backup image could become corrupted.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, you can use the ‘sync’ option with ‘dd’, which ensures that all I/O operations complete before the command returns:\n\nAnother common issue with ‘dd’ is slow performance. This can be due to a variety of factors, such as disk speed, block size, and system load. For example, using a small block size can significantly slow down ‘dd’ operations:\n\nIn this example, the block size is set to 512 bytes, which can result in slow performance. To improve performance, you can use a larger block size, such as 4K or even 1M:\n\nIn conclusion, while ‘dd’ is a powerful tool, it’s important to be aware of potential issues and how to troubleshoot them. Always use ‘dd’ with caution, and make sure to test your commands on non-critical data before running them on important files or systems.\n\nThe ‘dd’ command is a staple in the Linux command-line toolbox. It’s a feature-rich utility that has its roots in the early days of Unix, and has been a part of Linux distributions since the beginning.\n\nThe name ‘dd’ is an homage to IBM JCL (Job Control Language), where ‘dd’ stands for ‘Data Description’. In the context of the ‘dd’ command, it’s used to copy and convert raw data.\n\nHow Does the DD Command Work?\n\nThe ‘dd’ command reads input from a file or a device, and writes it to another file or device. Both input and output can be anything that resembles a file. This is why ‘dd’ can be used to perform tasks such as copying disks.\n\nHere’s a simple example of copying data from one file to another:\n\nIn this example, ‘dd’ reads from ‘input.txt’ and writes to ‘output.txt’. The ‘if’ and ‘of’ stand for ‘input file’ and ‘output file’, respectively.\n\nThe Role of File Systems and Data Formats\n\nOne of the reasons ‘dd’ is so versatile is because it works at a low level, dealing directly with raw data. This means it doesn’t care about file systems or data formats. Whether you’re copying a text file, an image, or a complete disk, ‘dd’ treats them all as raw data.\n\nThis is why ‘dd’ can be used to create disk images. Here’s an example:\n\nIn this example, ‘dd’ is reading data directly from the ‘/dev/sda’ disk and writing it to a file. This creates a complete image of the disk, including the boot sector, partition table, and all file systems.\n\nIn conclusion, the ‘dd’ command is a powerful and flexible tool that operates at a low level, allowing it to work with a wide range of data types, file systems, and devices. Its versatility and power have made it a mainstay in the Linux command-line toolbox.\n\nThe Relevance of DD Command Beyond File Copying\n\nThe ‘dd’ command in Linux is not just a tool for copying and converting files. Its power and flexibility make it a valuable asset in areas such as system administration and data recovery.\n\nIn system administration, the ‘dd’ command can be used for tasks such as backing up and restoring entire disks or partitions. Here’s an example of creating a backup image of a disk:\n\nIn this example, ‘dd’ reads data directly from the ‘/dev/sda’ disk and writes it to a file. This creates a complete image of the disk, which can be restored later if needed.\n\nThe ‘dd’ command can also be used in data recovery. For example, if a disk has bad sectors, ‘dd’ can be used to create an image of the disk, skipping over the bad sectors. This image can then be mounted and files can be recovered from it. Here’s an example:\n\nIn this example, the ‘conv=noerror,sync’ option tells ‘dd’ to continue operation after read errors, and to pad the output block with NULs if there are read errors.\n\nTo deepen your understanding of the ‘dd’ command and related concepts, here are some resources you might find helpful:\n• GNU Coreutils Manual: This is the official manual for ‘dd’ from GNU. It provides a detailed description of the command and its options.\n• None The Linux Documentation Project: This page provides a summary of the ‘dd’ command and its uses.\n• None Linux Command Library: This page provides a user-friendly guide to the ‘dd’ command, including examples and explanations.\n\nRemember, mastering the ‘dd’ command and related concepts like disk management in Linux and file I/O can open up new possibilities in system administration, data recovery, and more. Happy learning!\n\nWrapping Up: Mastering the DD Command in Linux\n\nIn this comprehensive guide, we’ve explored the ins and outs of the ‘dd’ command in Linux. This powerful tool, used for copying and converting files, holds a significant place in the Linux command-line toolbox.\n\nWe began with the basics, understanding how to use the ‘dd’ command for simple file copying tasks.

        "document": "The command is a classic Linux utility that has stood the test of time. Even though modern alternatives such as and are often used for data recovery and forensics, remains the go-to tool for cloning drives byte for byte, testing disk I/O performance, and writing bootable ISOs.\n\nFind out how the command works through a set of practical examples.\n\nThe command syntax is not as intuitive or flexible as some modern alternatives. It does not provide confirmation or warning before overwriting files or devices. Users must be careful, as a single typo can lead to irreversible data loss.\n\nIn its simplest form, uses the following syntax:\n• specifies the source to read from: a file, raw device, or disk partition.\n• specifies the destination to write the data, which can also be a file, disk image, or USB drive.\n• specify how data is read, written, and processed. They give users low-level control over tasks like cloning or erasing disks and creating compressed disk images.\n\nFor example, the following command copies the first partition from an internal SSD to a backup image on an external USB drive:\n\nThe 1-megabyte block size ( ) is applied for better speed and control, while the option displays real-time transfer progress in the terminal.\n\nThe following table lists the most common options and their functions:\n\nThe following command examples show how to back up and restore disks, test disk performance, and perform other essential system administration tasks. Modify the parameters to meet your specific task requirements.\n\nOne of the common uses of the command is to create a bootable USB drive. The following command writes an ISO image of an operating system to an external USB device:\n\nThe option speeds up the process by reading and writing data in 4 MB chunks. The option displays the progress in real time with transfer speed and statistics.\n\nUse the following command to create an exact copy of the primary disk:\n\nThe option prevents minor read errors from interrupting the copying process. fills unreadable blocks with zeroes to maintain the alignment between the two disks.\n\nEnter the following command to create a full disk backup of an NVMe SSD as an image file:\n\nThe block size value is increased to to speed up the process. The full backup will include partition tables, boot sectors, and data.\n\nAfter creating a full disk backup, you can restore the original disk from the disk image:\n\nAlternatively, use direct I/O to restore a backup image more efficiently:\n\nThe option bypasses the system's cache to improve performance during large data transfers.\n\nUse the following command to create a 2GB swap file to be used as additional virtual memory:\n\nThe and options define the file's size (1MB x 2048 = 2GB).\n\nEnsure that only the root user can read or write to the swap file:\n\nActivate the swap file so the system can use it:\n\nYou can make the swap file persistent across reboots by adding it to the /etc/fstab file.\n\nThe following command removes all data from a disk and replaces it with zeroes:\n\nThe disk is wiped clean and reset to a zeroed-out state. To add another security layer, you can write random data instead of zeroes using the following command:\n\nRandom data makes it harder for unauthorized individuals to recover previously stored information on the disk.\n\nUse the command to create a temporary file to measure a disk's write performance. In this example, the command writes 1GB of zeroes to the tempfile to assess writing speeds:\n\nThe option is used to flush all data to the disk and provide more accurate results.\n\nTo measure a disk's read performance, you can read from the device and discard the data without writing it to a destination:\n\nThe option shows real-time progress and transfer speeds to help you analyze the disk's read performance.\n\nOften, it is not necessary to copy an entire disk. You can copy a specific range of blocks using the and options:\n\nIn this example, the copy process initially skips 10 blocks (10 x 4MB=40MB) and then copies the following 100 blocks (100 x 4MB=400MB).\n\nThe option is ideal for defining where to start writing data on the destination device. The following command tells to start writing data from example_file.bin at the 50th MB of the output device:\n\nThe block size is set to 1 MB and the value to 50 to target the 50th MB.\n\nYou can backup data from a CD/DVD by copying its content to an ISO image on a local partition:\n\nThe ISO image preserves the original file structure and can later be mounted or burned to a new disc.\n\nOccasionally, you may need to wipe partition tables from a disk to create a new partition layout or resolve corrupted tables. The following command overwrites the first 4 MB of the disk, where the partition tables are stored, with zeroes:\n\nWithout a partition table, the operating system cannot detect the partitions and views the disk as uninitialized.\n\nis commonly used with the command to create a compressed disk image and conserve space. Use the following command to pipe the disk drive data into and create a backup image:\n\nTo restore the disk from the compressed image, use:\n\nThese commands reduce storage requirements and allow you to restore a backup with a single command.\n\nUse the command with to create an encrypted disk image. The following command reads data from the specified disk and encrypts it using AES-256 encryption:\n\nThe disk image backup.img.enc is now encrypted and can be stored in a remote location like a public cloud.\n\nYou can combine the and options to write data at a specific location on the output device. In the following example, the option ensures no data is copied from the input while skips the first block (512 bytes) on the output device before writing:\n\nThis is useful for tasks like installing a bootloader in a particular sector without overwriting other data.\n\nWhen troubleshooting, it is sometimes necessary to analyze the system's memory. The following command places 100 megabytes of system memory into the memory_dump.bin file for easier manipulation and analysis:\n\nThis command requires root permissions. Be cautious, as it can expose passwords, encryption keys, or other sensitive user data otherwise safely stored in memory.\n\nThe Master Boot Record (MBR) contains a disk's bootloader and partition table. If the MBR gets overwritten or corrupted, you can restore it from a backup. To create a backup of the MBR, type:\n\nThis command copies the first 512 bytes of the disk, which contains the MBR. Use the following command to restore the MBR from the backup:\n\nThe content from the backup file is written back to the disk.\n\nThe article showed how the command works and how to use its options. Refer to the practical examples in this resource when using , as small syntax errors can result in critical data loss.\n\nConsider using alternatives like the cp command or mv command, which carry less risk for more straightforward tasks."
