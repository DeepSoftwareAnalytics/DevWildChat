Using FAWE API from the main thread is likely to block the main thread if FAWE is used correctly. (and the other methods) are blocking, as is so anything you want to happen after an edit, place after closing the EditSession with close(), try-with-resources, etc. Always ensure EditSessions are closed before doing anything else, and that you do not reuse EditSessions else changes may not necessarily be flushed to the world.\n\nIf you are looking for snapshots, add the repository of S01 OSS Sonatype to the repositories' block."
