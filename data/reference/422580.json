Here, the islice function is used to return an iterator that produces the items from the list starting from the first item to the second to the last item, by specifying the start and stop indices as 0 and len(li)-1 respectively.

        "document": "Python lists can store an ordered collection of items, or elements, of varying types. They are often used to compile multiple items into a single, mutable variable, which is helpful for retrieving items, specifying outputs or performing calculations quickly. Lists are also a type of built-in data structure in Python (along with tuples, sets and dictionaries), which is a specified way of storing and formatting data.\n\nIf you’re curious about using lists in Python, here’s how to create one and modify them in different ways.\n\nHow to Create a List in Python\n\nTo create a list in Python, write a set of items within square brackets ([]) and separate each item with a comma. Items in a list can be any basic object type found in Python, including integers, strings, floating point values or boolean values.\n\nFor example, to create a list named “z” that holds the integers 3, 7, 4 and 2, you would write:\n\nThe “z” list defined above has items that are all of the same type (integer or int), but as mentioned, all the items in a list do not need to be of the same type as you can see below.\n\nThis list contains an integer (int), a bool, a string and a float.\n\nAll Python lists include the following features or characteristics:\n• Lists can contain items of different types at the same time (including strings, integers, floating point numbers and boolean values).\n• Lists are mutable and dynamic; list items can be added, removed or changed after the list is defined.\n• Lists are ordered; newly added items will be placed at the end of the list.\n• Lists use zero-based indexing; every list item has an associated index, and the first item’s index is 0.\n• Lists can be nested within other lists indefinitely.\n\nHow to Access Values in a Python List\n\nEach item in a list has an assigned index value. It’s important to note that Python is a zero-indexed based language. All this means is that the first item in the list starts at index 0 and ascends accordingly. In the example list, “z,” the indices of each list item would look like this:\n\nTo access an item value, print the index of the associated item in the list. As an example, say you wanted to access the first item from the list “z,” shown in blue below:\n\nTo access this item, you would use the item’s index, 0, and write:\n\nPython also supports negative indexing. Negative indexing starts at the end. It can be more convenient at times to use negative indexing to get the last item in the list because you don’t have to know the length of the list to access the last item.\n\nAs a reminder, you could also access the same item using positive indexes, as seen below.\n\nSlices are good for getting a subset of values in your list. For the example code below, it will return a list with the items from index 0 up to and not including index 2.\n\nThe code below returns a list with items from index 1 to the end of the list\n\nHow to Update an Item in a Python List\n\nLists in Python are mutable. After defining a list, it’s possible to update the individual items in a list.\n\nPython lists have different methods that help you modify a list. This section of the tutorial just goes over various python list methods.\n\nThe index method returns the first index at which a value occurs. Say you want to get the index of the first occurrence of “4” in this list:\n\nIn the code below, using index() will return 0.\n\nYou can also specify where you want to start your search if there are multiple of the same list item.\n\nJust like how it sounds, the count method counts the number of times a value occurs in a list\n\nThe sort method sorts and alters the original list in place.\n\nThe code above sorts a list from low to high. The code below shows that you can also sort a list from high to low.\n\nAs an aside, I should mention that you can also sort a list of strings from “a-z” and “z-a”.\n\nMore on Sorting in Python: 4 Python Tools to Simplify Your Life\n\nThe append method adds an element to the end of a list. This happens in place.\n\nThe remove method removes the first occurrence of a value in a list.\n\nCode removes the first occurrence of the value 2 from the list z.\n\nThe pop method removes an item at the index you provide. This method will also return the item you removed from the list. If you don’t provide an index, it will default to removing the item at the last index.\n\nThis method extends a list by appending items. The benefit of this is you can add lists together.\n\nAlternatively, the same thing could be accomplished by using the operator.\n\nThe insert method inserts an item before the index you provide."

        "document": "This question has been answered but I wanted to address the comment that using list comprehension is much slower than using .\n\nSome profiles from my machine (notebook using Python 3.6.9).\n\nIf you use the fastest way to copy a list (which isn't very readable), you will be about 45% faster than using list comprehension. But if you copy the list by using the class (which is much more common and Pythonic), then you're going to be 25% slower than using list comprehension.\n\nReally, it's all pretty fast. I think the argument could be made that is more readable than list a list comprehension technique, but it's not necessarily faster unless you're interested in giving up readability in the duplication.\n\nThe big advantage of list comprehension in this scenario is that it's much more succinct (i.e. if you had a function that was to remove an element from a given list for some reason, it could be done in 1 line, whilst the other method would require 3 lines.) There are times in which one-liners can be very handy (although they typically come at the cost of some readability). Additionally, using list comprehension excels in the case when you don't actually know if the element to be removed is actually in the list to begin with. While will throw a , list comprehension will operate as expected."

        "document": "Consider instead a Pythonic approach. As Ed Post once put it, \"The determined Real Programmer can write FORTRAN programs in any language\" -- and this generalizes... you're trying to write C in Python and it isn't working well for you:-)\n\nRather, think of putting an auxiliary cache next to the -- caching the indices where items are found (needs to be invalidated only on \"deep\" changes to the list's structure). Much simpler and faster...\n\nProbably best done by having and in a small class:\n\nYou need only define the mutators you actually need to use -- e.g, if you won't do , , , &c, no need to define those, you can just delegate them to the list.\n\nAdded: in Python 3.2 or better, can actually do most of the work for you -- use it to decorate and you'll get a better implementation of caching, with the ability to limit cache size if you so desire. To clear the cache, you'll need to call at the appropriate spots (where I above use ) -- unfortunately, that crucial functionality is not (yet!-) documented (the volunteers updating the docs are not the same ones updating the code...!-)... but, trust me, it's not going to disappear on you:-).\n\nAdded: the OP edited the Q to clarify that he's not after \"value equality\", but rather some more complex set of conditions, exemplified by a predicate such as:\n\nPresumably, then, the desire to bring \"good\" items towards the front is in turn predicated on their \"goodness\" being \"sticky\", i.e, staying pretty much the same for a while. In this case, one can use the predicate one as a feature extraction and checking function, which forms the key into the dictionary -- so for example:\n\nand so forth.\n\nSo the remaining difficulty is to put in a form suitable for effective indexing into a . If is just a function, no problem. But if is a function with parameters, as formed e.g by or as a bound method of some instance, that requires a bit of further processing/wrapping to make the indexing work.\n\nTwo calls to with the same bound argument(s) and function, for example, do not return equal objects -- one has, rather, to inspect the and of the returned objects to ensure, so to speak, a \"singleton\" is returned for any given pair.\n\nMoreover, if some of the bound arguments are mutable, one needs to use their in lieu of their (or else the raw object would not be hashable). It gets even hairier for bound methods, though they can similarly be wrapped into e.g a hashable, \"equality adjusted\" class.\n\nLastly, if these gyrations prove too cumbersome and you really want a fast implementation of a linked list instead, look at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/llist/0.4 -- it's a C-coded implementation of singly and doubly linked lists for Python (for each kind, it implements three types: the list itself, the list node, and the list's iterator)."

        "document": "In Python, lists are mutable data structures, meaning their elements can be modified after they are created. However, this behavior can sometimes lead to unintended consequences, especially when you want to perform operations on a list without affecting the original data.\n\nList immutability refers to the concept of creating a new list without modifying the original one. This is important when you need to perform operations on a list, such as filtering, sorting, or transforming the data, without affecting the original list.\n\nIn the example above, the method modifies the original list, which may not be the desired behavior in certain scenarios.\n\nMaintaining the immutability of lists is crucial in the following situations:\n• Functional Programming: In functional programming, the principle of immutability is highly valued, as it helps to prevent unintended side effects and makes the code more predictable and easier to reason about.\n• Concurrency and Multithreading: When working with concurrent or multithreaded applications, modifying a shared list can lead to race conditions and other synchronization issues. Maintaining list immutability can help to avoid these problems.\n• Data Integrity: In applications where data integrity is critical, such as financial or scientific applications, it is important to ensure that the original data is not accidentally modified during processing.\n\nOne of the key techniques for achieving list immutability is list slicing. List slicing allows you to create a new list by extracting a subset of elements from the original list, without modifying the original list.\n\nIn the example above, the syntax creates a new list that is a copy of the original list, ensuring that the original list remains unchanged."
