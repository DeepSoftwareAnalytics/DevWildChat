Node.js 0.6 or higher is required.\n\nInstallation is done using the command:\n\nFor information about the previous 0.9.x releases, visit the v0.9 branch.\n\nSometimes I may also ask you to install the latest version from Github to check if a bugfix is working. In this case, please do:\n\nThis is a node.js driver for mysql. It is written in JavaScript, does not require compiling, and is 100% MIT licensed.\n\nHere is an example on how to use it:\n\nFrom this example, you can learn the following:\n• Every method you invoke on a connection is queued and executed in sequence.\n• Closing the connection is done using which makes sure all remaining queries are executed before sending a quit packet to the mysql server.\n\nThanks goes to the people who have contributed code to this module, see the GitHub Contributors page.\n\nAdditionally I'd like to thank the following people:\n• Andrey Hristov (Oracle) - for helping me with protocol questions.\n• Ulf Wendel (Oracle) - for helping me with protocol questions.\n\nThe following companies have supported this project financially, allowing me to spend more time on it (ordered by time of contribution):\n• Transloadit (my startup, we do file uploading & video encoding as a service, check it out)\n\nIf you'd like to discuss this module, or ask questions about it, please use one of the following:\n• IRC Channel: #node.js (on freenode.net, I pay attention to any message including the term )\n\nThe recommended way to establish a connection is this:\n\nHowever, a connection can also be implicitly established by invoking a query:\n\nDepending on how you like to handle your errors, either method may be appropriate. Any type of connection error (handshake or network) is considered a fatal error, see the Error Handling section for more information.\n\nWhen establishing a connection, you can set the following options:\n• : The hostname of the database you are connecting to. (Default: )\n• : The port number to connect to. (Default: )\n• : The source IP address to use for TCP connection. (Optional)\n• : The path to a unix domain socket to connect to. When used and are ignored.\n• : The MySQL user to authenticate as.\n• : The password of that MySQL user.\n• : Name of the database to use for this connection (Optional).\n• : The charset for the connection. This is called \"collation\" in the SQL-level of MySQL (like ). If a SQL-level charset is specified (like ) then the default collation for that charset is used. (Default: )\n• : The timezone configured on the MySQL server. This is used to type cast server date/time values to JavaScript object and vice versa. This can be , , or an offset in the form or . (Default: )\n• : The milliseconds before a timeout occurs during the initial connection to the MySQL server. (Default: )\n• : Stringify objects instead of converting to values. (Default: )\n• : Allow connecting to MySQL instances that ask for the old (insecure) authentication method. (Default: )\n• : Determines if column values should be converted to native JavaScript types. (Default: )\n• : When dealing with big numbers (BIGINT and DECIMAL columns) in the database, you should enable this option (Default: ).\n• : Enabling both and forces big numbers (BIGINT and DECIMAL columns) to be always returned as JavaScript String objects (Default: ). Enabling but leaving disabled will return big numbers as String objects only when they cannot be accurately represented with [JavaScript Number objects] (https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-ecmascript-language-types-number-type) (which happens when they exceed the [-2^53, +2^53] range), otherwise they will be returned as Number objects. This option is ignored if is disabled.\n• : Force date types (TIMESTAMP, DATETIME, DATE) to be returned as strings rather than inflated into JavaScript Date objects. Can be / or an array of type names to keep as strings. (Default: )\n• : Prints protocol details to stdout. Can be / or an array of packet type names that should be printed. (Default: )\n• : Generates stack traces on to include call site of library entrance (\"long stack traces\"). Slight performance penalty for most calls. (Default: )\n• : Allow to use the modifier. (Default: )\n• : Allow multiple mysql statements per query. Be careful with this, it could increase the scope of SQL injection attacks. (Default: )\n• : List of connection flags to use other than the default ones. It is also possible to blacklist default ones. For more information, check Connection Flags.\n• : object with ssl parameters or a string containing name of ssl profile. See SSL options.\n\nIn addition to passing these options as an object, you can also use a url string. For example:\n\nNote: The query values are first attempted to be parsed as JSON, and if that fails assumed to be plaintext strings.\n\nThe option in the connection options takes a string or an object. When given a string, it uses one of the predefined SSL profiles included. The following profiles are included:\n• : this profile is for connecting to an Amazon RDS server and contains the certificates from https://rds.amazonaws.com/doc/rds-ssl-ca-cert.pem and https://s3.amazonaws.com/rds-downloads/rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem\n\nWhen connecting to other servers, you will need to provide an object with any of the following options:\n• : The certificate(s) to trust instead of the ones Node.js is configured to trust. This refers to the value of the certificate(s) and not a filename of the certificate(s). This is passed as the option for the underlying call (or underlying if using Node.js below 0.12).\n• : The client certificate to use in the SSL handshake. This is passed as the option for the underlying call (or underlying if using Node.js below 0.12).\n• : The ciphers to use to use in the SSL handshake instead of the default ones for Node.js. This is passed as the option for call (or underlying if using Node.js below 0.12).\n• : This is passed as the option for the underlying call.\n• : This is passed as the option for the underlying call.\n• : This is passed as the option for call (or underlying if using Node.js below 0.12).\n• : This is passed as the option for call (or underlying if using Node.js below 0.12).\n• : The server certificate is verified against the list of supplied CAs and the hostname, and if no match is found, the SSL connection will fail. (Default: )\n\nHere is a simple example:\n\nYou can also connect to a MySQL server without properly providing the appropriate CA to trust. You should not do this.\n\nIf, for any reason, you would like to change the default connection flags, you can use the connection option . Pass a string with a comma separated list of items to add to the default flags. If you don't want a default flag to be used prepend the flag with a minus sign. To add a flag that is not in the default list, just write the flag name, or prefix it with a plus (case insensitive).\n\nThe following flags are available:\n• - Enable protocol compression. This feature is not currently supported by the Node.js implementation so cannot be turned on. (Default off)\n• - Ability to specify the database on connection. (Default on)\n• - Send the found rows instead of the affected rows as . (Default on)\n• - Don't issue SIGPIPE if network failures. This flag has no effect on this Node.js implementation. (Default on)\n• - Let the parser ignore spaces before the in queries. (Default on)\n• - Indicates to the MySQL server this is an \"interactive\" client. This will use the interactive timeouts on the MySQL server and report as interactive in the process list. (Default off)\n• - Can use . This flag is controlled by the connection option . (Default on)\n• - Use the improved version of Old Password Authentication. (Default on)\n• - Can handle multiple resultsets for queries. (Default on)\n• - The client may send multiple statement per query or statement prepare (separated by ). This flag is controlled by the connection option . (Default off)\n• Special handling of ODBC behaviour. This flag has no effect on this Node.js implementation. (Default on)\n• - Uses the plugin authentication mechanism when connecting to the MySQL server. This feature is not currently supported by the Node.js implementation so cannot be turned on. (Default off)\n• - Uses the 4.1 protocol. (Default on)\n• - Can handle multiple resultsets for execute. (Default on)\n• - This is specific to the C client, and has no effect on this Node.js implementation. (Default off)\n• - Old flag for the 4.1 protocol. (Default on)\n• - Use SSL after handshake to encrypt data in transport. This feature is controlled though the connection option, so the flag has no effect. (Default off)\n• - Verify the server certificate during SSL set up. This feature is controlled though the connection option, so the flag has no effect. (Default off)\n• - Asks for the transaction status flags. (Default on)\n\nThere are two ways to end a connection. Terminating a connection gracefully is done by calling the method:\n\nThis will make sure all previously enqueued queries are still executed before sending a packet to the MySQL server. If a fatal error occurs before the packet can be sent, an argument will be provided to the callback, but the connection will be terminated regardless of that.\n\nAn alternative way to end the connection is to call the method. This will cause an immediate termination of the underlying socket. Additionally guarantees that no more events or callbacks will be triggered for the connection.\n\nUnlike the method does not take a callback argument.\n\nRather than creating and managing connections one-by-one, this module also provides built-in connection pooling using . Read more about connection pooling.\n\nCreate a pool and use it directly:\n\nThis is a shortcut for the -> -> code flow. Using is useful to share connection state for subsequent queries. This is because two calls to may use two different connections and run in parallel. This is the basic structure:\n\nIf you would like to close the connection and remove it from the pool, use instead. The pool will create a new connection the next time one is needed.\n\nConnections are lazily created by the pool. If you configure the pool to allow up to 100 connections, but only ever use 5 simultaneously, only 5 connections will be made. Connections are also cycled round-robin style, with connections being taken from the top of the pool and returning to the bottom.\n\nWhen a previous connection is retrieved from the pool, a ping packet is sent to the server to check if the connection is still good.\n\nPools accept all the same options as a connection. When creating a new connection, the options are simply passed to the connection constructor. In addition to those options pools accept a few extras:\n• : The milliseconds before a timeout occurs during the connection acquisition. This is slightly different from , because acquiring a pool connection does not always involve making a connection. If a connection request is queued, the time the request spends in the queue does not count towards this timeout. (Default: )\n• : Determines the pool's action when no connections are available and the limit has been reached. If , the pool will queue the connection request and call it when one becomes available. If , the pool will immediately call back with an error. (Default: )\n• : The maximum number of connections to create at once. (Default: )\n• : The maximum number of connection requests the pool will queue before returning an error from . If set to , there is no limit to the number of queued connection requests. (Default: )\n\nThe pool will emit an event when a connection is acquired from the pool. This is called after all acquiring activity has been performed on the connection, right before the connection is handed to the callback of the acquiring code.\n\nThe pool will emit a event when a new connection is made within the pool. If you need to set session variables on the connection before it gets used, you can listen to the event.\n\nThe pool will emit an event when a callback has been queued to wait for an available connection.\n\nThe pool will emit a event when a connection is released back to the pool. This is called after all release activity has been performed on the connection, so the connection will be listed as free at the time of the event.\n\nWhen you are done using the pool, you have to end all the connections or the Node.js event loop will stay active until the connections are closed by the MySQL server. This is typically done if the pool is used in a script or when trying to gracefully shutdown a server. To end all the connections in the pool, use the method on the pool:\n\nThe method takes an optional callback that you can use to know when all the connections are ended.\n\nOnce is called, and other operations can no longer be performed. Wait until all connections in the pool are released before calling . If you use the shortcut method , in place of → → , wait until it completes.\n\ncalls on every active connection in the pool. This queues a packet on the connection and sets a flag to prevent from creating new connections. All commands / queries already in progress will complete, but new commands won't execute.\n• : If , will attempt to reconnect when connection fails. (Default: )\n• : If connection fails, node's increases. When is greater than , remove a node in the . (Default: )\n• : If connection fails, specifies the number of milliseconds before another connection attempt will be made. If set to , then node will be removed instead and never re-used. (Default: )\n• : The default selector. (Default: )\n• : Select the first node available unconditionally.\n\nMySQL offers a changeUser command that allows you to alter the current user and other aspects of the connection without shutting down the underlying socket:\n\nThe available options for this feature are:\n• : The name of the new user (defaults to the previous one).\n• : The password of the new user (defaults to the previous one).\n• : The new charset (defaults to the previous one).\n• : The new database (defaults to the previous one).\n\nA sometimes useful side effect of this functionality is that this function also resets any connection state (variables, transactions, etc.).\n\nErrors encountered during this operation are treated as fatal connection errors by this module.\n\nYou may lose the connection to a MySQL server due to network problems, the server timing you out, the server being restarted, or crashing. All of these events are considered fatal errors, and will have the . See the Error Handling section for more information.\n\nRe-connecting a connection is done by establishing a new connection. Once terminated, an existing connection object cannot be re-connected by design.\n\nWith Pool, disconnected connections will be removed from the pool freeing up space for a new connection to be created on the next getConnection call.\n\nWith PoolCluster, disconnected connections will count as errors against the related node, incrementing the error code for that node. Once there are more than errors on a given node, it is removed from the cluster. When this occurs, the PoolCluster may emit a error if there are no longer any matching nodes for the pattern. The config can be set to restore offline nodes after a given timeout.\n\nThe most basic way to perform a query is to call the method on an object (like a , , or instance).\n\nThe simplest form of is , where a SQL string is the first argument and the second is a callback:\n\nThe second form comes when using placeholder values (see escaping query values):\n\nThe third form comes when using various advanced options on the query, like escaping query values, joins with overlapping column names, timeouts, and type casting.\n\nNote that a combination of the second and third forms can be used where the placeholder values are passed as an argument and not in the options object. The argument will override the in the option object.\n\nIf the query only has a single replacement character ( ), and the value is not , , or an array, it can be passed directly as the second argument to :\n\nCaution These methods of escaping values only works when the NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES SQL mode is disabled (which is the default state for MySQL servers).\n\nCaution This library performs client-side escaping, as this is a library to generate SQL strings on the client side. The syntax for functions like may look similar to a prepared statement, but it is not and the escaping rules from this module are used to generate a resulting SQL string. The purpose of escaping input is to avoid SQL Injection attacks. In order to support enhanced support like and formatting, this module will escape based on the shape of the passed in JavaScript value, and the resulting escaped string may be more than a single value. When structured user input is provided as the value to escape, care should be taken to validate the shape of the input to validate the output will be what is expected.\n\nIn order to avoid SQL Injection attacks, you should always escape any user provided data before using it inside a SQL query. You can do so using the , or methods:\n\nAlternatively, you can use characters as placeholders for values you would like to have escaped like this:\n\nMultiple placeholders are mapped to values in the same order as passed. For example, in the following query equals , equals , equals , and will be :\n\nThis looks similar to prepared statements in MySQL, however it really just uses the same method internally.\n\nCaution This also differs from prepared statements in that all are replaced, even those contained in comments and strings.\n\nDifferent value types are escaped differently, here is how:\n• Arrays are turned into list, e.g. turns into\n• Nested arrays are turned into grouped lists (for bulk inserts), e.g. turns into\n• Objects that have a method will have called and the returned value is used as the raw SQL.\n• Objects are turned into pairs for each enumerable property on the object. If the property's value is a function, it is skipped; if the property's value is an object, toString() is called on it and the returned value is used.\n• / are left as-is. MySQL does not support these, and trying to insert them as values will trigger MySQL errors until they implement support.\n\nThis escaping allows you to do neat things like this:\n\nAnd the method allows you to form complex queries with functions:\n\nTo generate objects with a method, the method can be used. This creates an object that will be left un-touched when using in a placeholder, useful for using functions as dynamic values:\n\nCaution The string provided to will skip all escaping functions when used, so be careful when passing in unvalidated input.\n\nIf you feel the need to escape queries by yourself, you can also use the escaping function directly:\n\nIf you can't trust an SQL identifier (database / table / column name) because it is provided by a user, you should escape it with , or like this:\n\nIt also supports adding qualified identifiers. It will escape both parts.\n\nIf you do not want to treat as qualified identifiers, you can set the second argument to in order to keep the string as a literal identifier:\n\nAlternatively, you can use characters as placeholders for identifiers you would like to have escaped like this:\n\nPlease note that this last character sequence is experimental and syntax might change\n\nWhen you pass an Object to or , is used to avoid SQL injection in object keys.\n\nYou can use mysql.format to prepare a query with multiple insertion points, utilizing the proper escaping for ids and values. A simple example of this follows:\n\nFollowing this you then have a valid, escaped query that you can then send to the database safely. This is useful if you are looking to prepare the query before actually sending it to the database. As mysql.format is exposed from SqlString.format you also have the option (but are not required) to pass in stringifyObject and timezone, allowing you provide a custom means of turning objects into strings, as well as a location-specific/timezone-aware Date.\n\nIf you prefer to have another type of query escape format, there's a connection configuration option you can use to define a custom format function. You can access the connection object if you want to use the built-in or any other connection function.\n\nHere's an example of how to implement another format:\n\nIf you are inserting a row into a table with an auto increment primary key, you can retrieve the insert id like this:\n\nWhen dealing with big numbers (above JavaScript Number precision limit), you should consider enabling option to be able to read the insert id as a string, otherwise it will throw an error.\n\nThis option is also required when fetching big numbers from the database, otherwise you will get values rounded to hundreds or thousands due to the precision limit.\n\nYou can get the number of affected rows from an insert, update or delete statement.\n\nYou can get the number of changed rows from an update statement.\n\n\"changedRows\" differs from \"affectedRows\" in that it does not count updated rows whose values were not changed.\n\nYou can get the MySQL connection ID (\"thread ID\") of a given connection using the property.\n\nThe MySQL protocol is sequential, this means that you need multiple connections to execute queries in parallel. You can use a Pool to manage connections, one simple approach is to create one connection per incoming http request.\n\nSometimes you may want to select large quantities of rows and process each of them as they are received. This can be done like this:\n\nPlease note a few things about the example above:\n• Usually you will want to receive a certain amount of rows before starting to throttle the connection using . This number will depend on the amount and size of your rows.\n• / operate on the underlying socket and parser. You are guaranteed that no more events will fire after calling .\n• You MUST NOT provide a callback to the method when streaming rows.\n• The event will fire for both rows as well as OK packets confirming the success of a INSERT/UPDATE query.\n• It is very important not to leave the result paused too long, or you may encounter The time limit for this is determined by the net_write_timeout setting on your MySQL server.\n\nAdditionally you may be interested to know that it is currently not possible to stream individual row columns, they will always be buffered up entirely. If you have a good use case for streaming large fields to and from MySQL, I'd love to get your thoughts and contributions on this.\n\nThe query object provides a convenience method that wraps query events into a Readable Stream object. This stream can easily be piped downstream and provides automatic pause/resume, based on downstream congestion and the optional . The parameter of the stream is set to and cannot be changed (if you need a byte stream, you will need to use a transform stream, like objstream for example).\n\nFor example, piping query results into another stream (with a max buffer of 5 objects) is simply:\n\nSupport for multiple statements is disabled for security reasons (it allows for SQL injection attacks if values are not properly escaped). To use this feature you have to enable it for your connection:\n\nOnce enabled, you can execute multiple statement queries like any other query:\n\nAdditionally you can also stream the results of multiple statement queries:\n\nIf one of the statements in your query causes an error, the resulting Error object contains a property which tells you which statement caused it. MySQL will also stop executing any remaining statements when an error occurs.\n\nPlease note that the interface for streaming multiple statement queries is experimental and I am looking forward to feedback on it.\n\nYou can call stored procedures from your queries as with any other mysql driver. If the stored procedure produces several result sets, they are exposed to you the same way as the results for multiple statement queries.\n\nWhen executing joins, you are likely to get result sets with overlapping column names.\n\nBy default, node-mysql will overwrite colliding column names in the order the columns are received from MySQL, causing some of the received values to be unavailable.\n\nHowever, you can also specify that you want your columns to be nested below the table name like this:\n\nOr use a string separator to have your results merged.\n\nSimple transaction support is available at the connection level:\n\nPlease note that beginTransaction(), commit() and rollback() are simply convenience functions that execute the START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK commands respectively. It is important to understand that many commands in MySQL can cause an implicit commit, as described in the MySQL documentation\n\nA ping packet can be sent over a connection using the method. This method will send a ping packet to the server and when the server responds, the callback will fire. If an error occurred, the callback will fire with an error argument.\n\nEvery operation takes an optional inactivity timeout option. This allows you to specify appropriate timeouts for operations. It is important to note that these timeouts are not part of the MySQL protocol, and rather timeout operations through the client. This means that when a timeout is reached, the connection it occurred on will be destroyed and no further operations can be performed.\n\nThis module comes with a consistent approach to error handling that you should review carefully in order to write solid applications.\n\nMost errors created by this module are instances of the JavaScript Error object. Additionally they typically come with two extra properties:\n• : String, contains the MySQL server error symbol if the error is a MySQL server error (e.g. ), a Node.js error code if it is a Node.js error (e.g. ), or an internal error code (e.g. ).\n• : Number, contains the MySQL server error number. Only populated from MySQL server error.\n• : Boolean, indicating if this error is terminal to the connection object. If the error is not from a MySQL protocol operation, this property will not be defined.\n• : String, contains the full SQL of the failed query. This can be useful when using a higher level interface like an ORM that is generating the queries.\n• : String, contains the five-character SQLSTATE value. Only populated from MySQL server error.\n• : String, contains the message string that provides a textual description of the error. Only populated from MySQL server error.\n\nFatal errors are propagated to all pending callbacks. In the example below, a fatal error is triggered by trying to connect to a blocked port. Therefore the error object is propagated to both pending callbacks:\n\nNormal errors however are only delegated to the callback they belong to. So in the example below, only the first callback receives an error, the second query works as expected:\n\nLast but not least: If a fatal errors occurs and there are no pending callbacks, or a normal error occurs which has no callback belonging to it, the error is emitted as an event on the connection object. This is demonstrated in the example below:\n\nNote: events are special in node. If they occur without an attached listener, a stack trace is printed and your process is killed.\n\ntl;dr: This module does not want you to deal with silent failures. You should always provide callbacks to your method calls. If you want to ignore this advice and suppress unhandled errors, you can do this:\n\nThis module is exception safe. That means you can continue to use it, even if one of your callback functions throws an error which you're catching using 'uncaughtException' or a domain.\n\nFor your convenience, this driver will cast mysql types into native JavaScript types by default. The default behavior can be changed through various Connection options. The following mappings exist:\n• BIT (last byte will be filled with 0 bits as necessary)\n\nNote text in the binary character set is returned as , rather than a string.\n• TIME (could be mapped to Date, but what date would be set?)\n• GEOMETRY (never used those, get in touch if you do)\n\nIt is not recommended (and may go away / change in the future) to disable type casting, but you can currently do so on either the connection:\n\nOr on the query level:\n\nYou can also pass a function and handle type casting yourself. You're given some column information like database, table and name and also type and length. If you just want to apply a custom type casting to a specific type you can do it and then fallback to the default.\n\nThe function is provided two arguments and and is expected to return the value for the given field by invoking the parser functions through the object.\n\nThe argument is a object and contains data about the field that need to be parsed. The following are some of the properties on a object:\n• - a string of the database the field came from.\n• - a string of the table the field came from.\n• - a string of the field name.\n• - a string of the field type in all caps.\n• - a number of the field length, as given by the database.\n\nThe argument is a that, when called, will return the default type conversion for the given field.\n\nWhen getting the field data, the following helper methods are present on the object:\n• - parse the field as a geometry value.\n\nThe MySQL protocol is a text-based protocol. This means that over the wire, all field types are represented as a string, which is why only string-like functions are available on the object. Based on the type information (like ), the type cast should convert the string field into a different JavaScript type (like a ).\n\nHere's an example of converting to boolean:\n\nWARNING: YOU MUST INVOKE the parser using one of these three field functions in your custom typeCast callback.

Depending on your store this may be necessary, but it can also create race conditions where a client makes two parallel requests to your server and changes made to the session in one request may get overwritten when the other request ends, even if it made no changes (this behavior also depends on what store you’re using).\n\nThe default value is , but using the default has been deprecated, as the default will change in the future. Please research into this setting and choose what is appropriate to your use-case. Typically, you’ll want .\n\nHow do I know if this is necessary for my store? The best way to know is to check with your store if it implements the method. If it does, then you can safely set .

The expiration is reset to the original , resetting the expiration countdown.\n\nThe default value is .\n\nWith this enabled, the session identifier cookie will expire in since the last response was sent instead of in since the session was last modified by the server.\n\nThis is typically used in conjuction with short, non-session-length values to provide a quick timeout of the session data with reduced potential of it occurring during on going server interactions.\n\nNote When this option is set to but the option is set to , the cookie will not be set on a response with an uninitialized session. This option only modifies the behavior when an existing session was loaded for the request.\n\nForces a session that is “uninitialized” to be saved to the store. A session is uninitialized when it is new but not modified. Choosing is useful for implementing login sessions, reducing server storage usage, or complying with laws that require permission before setting a cookie. Choosing will also help with race conditions where a client makes multiple parallel requests without a session.\n\nThe default value is , but using the default has been deprecated, as the default will change in the future. Please research into this setting and choose what is appropriate to your use-case.\n\nNote if you are using Session in conjunction with PassportJS, Passport will add an empty Passport object to the session for use after a user is authenticated, which will be treated as a modification to the session, causing it to be saved. This has been fixed in PassportJS 0.3.0\n\nThis is the secret used to sign the session ID cookie. The secret can be any type of value that is supported by Node.js (like a string or a ). This can be either a single secret, or an array of multiple secrets. If an array of secrets is provided, only the first element will be used to sign the session ID cookie, while all the elements will be considered when verifying the signature in requests. The secret itself should be not easily parsed by a human and would best be a random set of characters. A best practice may include:\n• The use of environment variables to store the secret, ensuring the secret itself does not exist in your repository.\n• Periodic updates of the secret, while ensuring the previous secret is in the array.\n\nUsing a secret that cannot be guessed will reduce the ability to hijack a session to only guessing the session ID (as determined by the option).\n\nChanging the secret value will invalidate all existing sessions. In order to rotate the secret without invalidating sessions, provide an array of secrets, with the new secret as first element of the array, and including previous secrets as the later elements.\n\nNote HMAC-256 is used to sign the session ID. For this reason, the secret should contain at least 32 bytes of entropy.\n\nThe session store instance, defaults to a new instance.\n\nControl the result of unsetting (through , setting to , etc.).\n\nThe default value is .\n• The session will be destroyed (deleted) when the response ends.\n• The session in the store will be kept, but modifications made during the request are ignored and not saved.\n\nTo store or access session data, simply use the request property , which is (generally) serialized as JSON by the store, so nested objects are typically fine. For example below is a user-specific view counter:\n\nTo regenerate the session simply invoke the method. Once complete, a new SID and instance will be initialized at and the will be invoked.\n\nDestroys the session and will unset the property. Once complete, the will be invoked.\n\nReloads the session data from the store and re-populates the object. Once complete, the will be invoked.\n\nSave the session back to the store, replacing the contents on the store with the contents in memory (though a store may do something else–consult the store’s documentation for exact behavior).\n\nThis method is automatically called at the end of the HTTP response if the session data has been altered (though this behavior can be altered with various options in the middleware constructor). Because of this, typically this method does not need to be called.\n\nThere are some cases where it is useful to call this method, for example, redirects, long-lived requests or in WebSockets.\n\nUpdates the property. Typically this is not necessary to call, as the session middleware does this for you.\n\nEach session has a unique ID associated with it. This property is an alias of and cannot be modified. It has been added to make the session ID accessible from the object.\n\nEach session has a unique cookie object accompany it. This allows you to alter the session cookie per visitor. For example we can set to to enable the cookie to remain for only the duration of the user-agent.\n\nAlternatively will return the time remaining in milliseconds, which we may also re-assign a new value to adjust the property appropriately. The following are essentially equivalent\n\nFor example when is set to (one minute), and 30 seconds has elapsed it will return until the current request has completed, at which time is called to reset to its original value.\n\nThe property returns the original (time-to-live), in milliseconds, of the session cookie.\n\nTo get the ID of the loaded session, access the request property . This is simply a read-only value set when a session is loaded/created.\n\nEvery session store must be an and implement specific methods. The following methods are the list of required, recommended, and optional.\n• Required methods are ones that this module will always call on the store.\n• Recommended methods are ones that this module will call on the store if available.\n• Optional methods are ones this module does not call at all, but helps present uniform stores to users.\n\nFor an example implementation view the connect-redis repo.\n\nThis optional method is used to get all sessions in the store as an array. The should be called as .\n\nThis required method is used to destroy/delete a session from the store given a session ID ( ). The should be called as once the session is destroyed.\n\nThis optional method is used to delete all sessions from the store.

The callback should be called as once the session has been set in the store.\n\nThis recommended method is used to “touch” a given session given a session ID ( ) and session ( ) object. The should be called as once the session has been touched.\n\nThis is primarily used when the store will automatically delete idle sessions and this method is used to signal to the store the given session is active, potentially resetting the idle timer.\n\nThe following modules implement a session store that is compatible with this module.

        "document": "Session management is a crucial aspect of web application development, as it ensures that user data and preferences are stored securely and accurately. In this article, we will explore how to implement session management in Node.js applications.\n\nSession management is the process of managing user sessions within a web application. A session is a period of time in which a user interacts with an application, typically starting when the user logs in and ending when they log out. Session management ensures that user data, preferences, and session-related information are securely stored and managed.\n\nTo implement session management in Node.js applications, you need to use a session management middleware. A middleware is a function that sits between the client and the server, processing requests and responses.\n\nThe first step in implementing session management in Node.js applications is to install and configure the session middleware. There are several session middleware options available for Node.js, including , , and . You can install and configure these middleware options using .\n\nTo install express-session, we can run the following command:\n\n\n\nOnce installed, we can require it in our Node.js application and configure it as follows:\n\n\n\nIn the above code sample, we have initialized the express-session middleware with the following configuration options:\n• None secret: This option is used to set a secret key for the session. The secret key is used to sign the session ID cookie to prevent tampering.\n• None resave: This option determines whether the session should be saved to the store on every request. Setting this option to false can improve performance.\n• None saveUninitialized: This option determines whether to save uninitialized sessions. Setting this option to false can improve performance.\n\nOnce you have installed and configured the session middleware, the next step is to initialize it. Initialization involves creating a session object that stores user data and preferences. You can initialize the session middleware in your application's entry point, such as or .\n\n\n\nIn the above code sample, we have initialized the session middleware and accessed the session data using the object.\n\nThe session middleware stores session data in the server's memory or a separate session store, such as a Redis database. When a user logs in, the session middleware creates a session object and assigns it a unique ID. The session ID is then stored in a cookie on the user's browser. The session middleware uses the session ID to retrieve the session data from the server or session store.\n\n\n\nIn the above code sample, we have stored session data for an authenticated user using the object.\n\nTo ensure that session data is not stored indefinitely, it is essential to manage session timeouts. Session timeouts determine how long a session can remain idle before it is invalidated. You can set a timeout for a session by configuring the session middleware. When a session timeout occurs, the session middleware deletes the session data from the server or session store.\n\nWe can set the session timeout using the option when initializing the session middleware. The option is expressed in milliseconds and determines the maximum age of a session.\n\n\n\nIn the above code sample, we have set the session timeout to 60 seconds using the option.\n\nWhen a user logs out or the session expires, we need to destroy the session to ensure that session data is not stored indefinitely. We can destroy a session using the method.\n\n\n\nIn the above code sample, we have destroyed the session using the method.\n\nTo retrieve session data, we can access the object. The object is an object that contains session data.\n\n\n\nIn the above code sample, we have retrieved session data using the object.\n\nFinally, it is crucial to secure session data to prevent unauthorized access or tampering. You can secure session data by using secure cookies, encrypting session data, and implementing HTTPS encryption.\n\nSession management is a critical part of web application development. In this article, we have explored how to implement session management in Node.js applications using the express-session middleware. We have covered installing and configuring the session middleware, initializing the session middleware, storing session data, managing session timeouts, destroying sessions, and retrieving session data. By following the best practices outlined in this article, you can ensure that your Node.js applications are secure and reliable."

        "document": "\n• How to Implement User Authentication in Node.js\n\nAuthentication and authorization are essential for web applications to ensure that only legitimate users gain access and that they can perform actions based on their permissions. Node.js and Express.js are popular tools for building these systems because they allow developers to create fast, scalable apps efficiently.\n\nHowever, implementing authentication can be challenging—securing passwords, managing sessions, and ensuring tokens aren’t misused require careful planning. Authorization adds more complexity by defining user roles and permissions, ensuring users only access what they’re allowed to. Good user management is critical for protecting both user data and application security, while also maintaining a smooth user experience.\n• Authentication: This process confirms the identity of the user—essentially verifying who they are. It typically involves methods like username and password checks, social login, or multi-factor authentication (MFA). For example, when a user logs into an application, authentication ensures that the individual is who they claim to be.\n• Authorization: Authorization determines what actions or resources the authenticated user can access. Once a user is authenticated, authorization checks whether they have the necessary permissions to perform specific operations, such as editing content or accessing admin features.\n\nAuthentication and authorization complement each other: authentication verifies the user, while authorization governs the extent of their access within the system.\n\nRBAC is a widely used strategy to manage user permissions efficiently by assigning roles to users. It simplifies authorization by grouping permissions under specific roles.\n• Assigning roles to users: Users are given predefined roles such as admin, editor, or viewer. Each role corresponds to a set of permissions. For example:\n• Admin: Full access to all operations, including creating, editing, and deleting content.\n• Editor: Can modify content but lacks access to administrative settings.\n• Defining permissions for each role: Each role has specific permissions that determine what resources the user can access and what actions they can perform. For example:\n• Admins can manage other users and change system configurations.\n• Editors can update or delete content but cannot manage users.\n• Importance of clear access rules:\n• Well-defined access rules reduce the risk of security loopholes. For example, without proper role separation, unauthorized users could gain access to sensitive data or critical system operations.\n• Consistency in applying roles and permissions ensures better maintainability. Centralized control via middleware helps avoid inconsistencies, preventing scenarios where users have unintended privileges.\n\nRBAC simplifies managing access, especially in applications with many users. By grouping permissions under roles, developers can ensure that user privileges are clear and manageable, helping to maintain a secure system.\n\nTo set up a secure user authentication system in Node.js, you’ll need several essential tools and packages. These will enable you to handle routing, password encryption, token management, and cookie parsing, laying the groundwork for a robust authentication flow.\n\nRun the server with the following command\n\nThere are several popular methods for handling authentication in web applications. Here’s an overview of the most commonly used approaches:\n• JWT (JSON Web Tokens): JWTs are used for stateless authentication, meaning the server doesn’t store session information. Instead, a token is generated when the user logs in, which includes encoded user data and is sent with each request. The server then verifies the token to authenticate the user, making JWTs ideal for scalable, stateless applications.\n• Session-based Authentication: This method involves storing session data on the server to keep track of user activity. When a user logs in, a session is created on the server, and a unique session ID is sent to the user’s browser, often in a cookie. This session ID is then used to identify the user for future requests. Session-based authentication is commonly used in applications where maintaining user state is essential.\n• OAuth: OAuth is often used for third-party login, allowing users to sign in with existing accounts from services like Google, Facebook, or GitHub. It simplifies user login by leveraging these providers for authentication, eliminating the need for users to create new credentials for each application. OAuth is widely used in applications that prioritize user convenience and wish to offer social login options.\n\nSetting Up the Server and Authentication Routes\n\nTo configure the server, connect to MongoDB, and set up authentication routes, write the following code in the file:\n\nHow to Implement User Authentication in Node.js\n\nTo securely register users, start by creating a Mongoose schema with fields for name, email, and password. Then, hash the password with before saving it to enhance security. Finally, include basic validation to ensure required fields and unique email entries. To implement this setup, write the following code:\n\nTo set up a secure login flow, validate user credentials by checking the stored hashed password in the database. JWT tokens will be used to maintain stateless sessions and manage token expiration, adding an extra layer of security. To implement this, write the following code in :\n\nTo restrict access to certain routes, middleware is used to ensure only authenticated users can access specific pages or data. The following code demonstrates a middleware function that checks for a valid token, verifies it, and grants access if authenticated. Write this code in :\n\nThis middleware function verifies if the request contains a valid JSON Web Token (JWT) in the authorization header. It checks for the token, verifies it using the secret key, and either allows access by calling or denies access if the token is invalid or missing.\n\nFor implementing registration and login with JWT generation, add the following routes in :\n\nFinally, to create a simple login form that authenticates users, use the following code:\n\nBuilding a secure authentication and authorization system requires more than just checking passwords and tokens. Developers must adopt a range of best practices to safeguard user data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure smooth user experiences. This section highlights common vulnerabilities—like insecure password storage, session mismanagement, and token misuse—and provides practical solutions to address them effectively.\n• Avoid storing plain-text passwords: Store passwords securely using encryption techniques like hashing. Libraries such as or generate hashed passwords that are computationally infeasible to reverse. This way, even if attackers gain access to the database, the original passwords remain protected.\n• Regularly update password policies: Encourage the use of strong passwords and implement features like password expiration or complexity requirements to minimize vulnerabilities.\n• Short expiration times for tokens: Use short-lived tokens to limit the risk from compromised credentials. For instance, access tokens may expire in 15 minutes, and refresh tokens should be rotated frequently.\n• Store sensitive information securely: Keep keys, secrets, and tokens safe by storing them in environment variables. Avoid hardcoding these sensitive values directly into the codebase to prevent exposure during development or deployment.\n• Avoid exposing internal information: Carefully design error messages to prevent leaking critical system information. For example, avoid messages like “Invalid username or password” to prevent attackers from inferring valid usernames.\n• Provide user-friendly but secure responses: Make sure error messages offer users relevant feedback without revealing sensitive details.\n• Encrypt all communication between clients and servers by using HTTPS. Encryption prevents sensitive data, such as login credentials or tokens, from being intercepted during transmission.\n• Prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks: Use anti-CSRF tokens for requests that modify data (non-GET requests). Libraries like for Express or built-in protection from tools like Supertokens can simplify the process​.\n• Mitigate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) risks: Use HttpOnly cookies to store tokens, ensuring they are inaccessible via JavaScript. This limits exposure to malicious scripts that might run on the client side. Additionally, validate user input and escape content properly to prevent injection attacks​.\n\nBy following these best practices, developers can create more secure systems, safeguarding both user data and the application from common vulnerabilities.\n\nSupertokens is a developer-friendly authentication platform designed to simplify the complexities of managing user sessions and secure access. It provides ready-made solutions for common challenges like user registration, login flows, session handling, and token management, so developers don’t have to build these systems from scratch. With a focus on efficiency and security, Supertokens offers both flexibility and scalability for applications of all sizes.\n• Session Management Made Easy: Supertokens automatically handles JWT-based sessions and token rotation, eliminating the need for manual token configurations. This ensures stateless authentication with minimal setup.\n• Built-in Social Login: It includes support for social login providers such as Google and Facebook, allowing users to sign up seamlessly without complex custom configurations.\n• Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): For applications that require stronger security, Supertokens provides support for MFA out of the box, offering advanced protection without adding unnecessary development overhead.\n• Development Efficiency: By providing secure, pre-built APIs, Supertokens reduces the amount of time needed to set up authentication and session management.\n• Reliable and Tested Authentication Flows: Supertokens ensures that authentication processes work consistently by adhering to best practices and implementing features like token rotation and expiration by default.\n• Lower Complexity: With Supertokens managing the backend intricacies of authentication, teams can focus on core application features, reducing complexity while maintaining security.\n• CSRF Protection: Supertokens includes built-in CSRF protection for non-GET API routes. This ensures that only legitimate requests are processed, reducing the risk of unauthorized actions through cross-site request forgery attacks​.\n• XSS Protection: For enhanced session security, Supertokens uses HttpOnly cookies to store tokens, which prevents them from being accessed by JavaScript in case of an XSS attack​. This makes session management safer by mitigating the risks associated with script injections.\n\nSupertokens provides a secure, scalable solution that automates much of the work involved in authentication and session management. By implementing Supertokens, developers can ensure their applications are protected while also saving time and effort that would otherwise go into managing these systems manually.\n\nAuthentication and authorization are essential for building secure web applications, requiring developers to carefully balance security, usability, and performance. These components ensure that only verified users gain access to the system and that their actions are appropriately controlled through permissions. This article covered the fundamental steps to build a secure authentication system, focusing on user registration, login, session management, and role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions effectively.\n\nFor developers looking to streamline the implementation process, Supertokens offers a powerful, ready-to-use solution. It reduces the time and complexity of managing tokens, sessions, and user roles while incorporating advanced security features such as XSS and CSRF protection. Explore Supertokens to simplify your authentication system, saving development effort and enhancing your application’s security and reliability​."

        "document": "Recently I was developing a CLI in Node.js that would help make the process of writing articles in Markdown easier for my team. The flow required that a local .md file be parsed, formatted, converted to .docx, and then uploaded to Google Drive as a Google Doc file, all by running one command from the terminal. I approached this project in a few different ways, hoping initially that I could use serverless functions to handle the backend. I hit a lot of dead ends on this route, and eventually decided to build an Express server that I would ultimately host on Heroku. To upload the .docx file contents from my CLI to a secure backend endpoint, where it would then be uploaded to the user’s authenticated Google Drive, I needed a way to directly from Node.js (without a browser). This requires several third party libraries, and it was pretty difficult to make them all play nice together. There weren’t great resources on the internet to help, and a lot of trial and error were involved. This article is going to explain how I did it. In order to follow along with this tutorial, you’ll need the following:\n• Node.js installed on your machine, along with a package manager like Set up your Node.js and express files app structure In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your general projects or development directory, and run the following commands:\n\nThe function is an asynchronous function. Inside the function is a block. This means that the function will “try” to do anything inside the block. If at any point the code encounters an error, it will immediately execute the block, where you can access the offending error. The first thing it tries to do in the block is create two variables: and . The reason line 3, where the variable is created, is highlighted is because you need to replace the file path shown with the path to the file you want to upload. This variable now represents a readable stream of your file.\n\nThe variable is where you’ll store the title of the file you’re uploading - you can change this to whatever string value you like. Beneath these variables is where the form itself is created. Two key/value pairs are appended to the form: one for the file, and one for its title. You can add any number of key/value pairs representing your form data to the object in this manner. Next, the entire form is posted to your Express backend (at an endpoint you’ll create later in this tutorial) using . Note that you’re passing an option object to the method with header information. The library makes it easy to ensure your headers are set correctly by giving you a method that will return headers appropriate to your form data. If there are no errors, then an “Upload complete” message will be logged to the console. Otherwise, the error message will be logged. Now that you’ve successfully sent your file, you need to be able to process it on your backend. In your terminal, navigate to your Express app:\n\nThere are a few things to take note of in this code - the important lines have been highlighted. On line 5, after the package is imported, you’re preparing to use Multer by calling the function, passing to it an options object with a key, and saving the returned object to a variable called . See the documentation for other ways to configure Multer, including saving the file to memory and not to disk. In this case, you’re specifying a value, because Multer needs to save your uploaded file somewhere. For my app, I only needed the file temporarily, so I set the destination to my server’s /tmp folder. If you need the uploaded files to persist, you could store them in another directory on your server, so long as you specify the path in this object. On line 7, before executing the API endpoint’s callback function, you’re calling the method on the object. There are many methods you can call on the object that are appropriate for different data configurations. In this example, because you’re uploading only one file, you’ll use the method. At this point, the object available in the endpoint’s callback function will be slightly different than what you’re used to. Despite not attaching any value to the form when you made the request, the value of your non-file form fields will be available on . The file you uploaded will be available at . In the code above, both of these objects are logged to the console. To see what they look like, test out the project. In your terminal, make sure you’re still inside the directory, and then run the following command:"

Instead, you want to push the files to a separate file server as soon as you receive them. The file server can be a cloud storage service such as AWS S3 or a database that supports BLOBs.\n• Base64 is a way to encode binary data into an ASCII character\n• If the file uploads that your making are large file uploads then I would for sure with confidence say that do not use Base64 because it converts whole data and post it to server.\n• Multipart is a way to upload data to server in the form of part which are in bytes. Multpart/form-data is applied to a form though, so you can send everything in a multi-part form, including \"regular\" data also."
