They are listed here in alphabetical order.\n\nOpen file and return a corresponding file object. If the file cannot be opened, an is raised. See Reading and Writing Files for more examples of how to use this function. file is a path-like object giving the pathname (absolute or relative to the current working directory) of the file to be opened or an integer file descriptor of the file to be wrapped. (If a file descriptor is given, it is closed when the returned I/O object is closed unless closefd is set to .) mode is an optional string that specifies the mode in which the file is opened. It defaults to which means open for reading in text mode. Other common values are for writing (truncating the file if it already exists), for exclusive creation, and for appending (which on some Unix systems, means that all writes append to the end of the file regardless of the current seek position). In text mode, if encoding is not specified the encoding used is platform-dependent: is called to get the current locale encoding. (For reading and writing raw bytes use binary mode and leave encoding unspecified.) The available modes are: open for writing, truncating the file first open for exclusive creation, failing if the file already exists open for writing, appending to the end of file if it exists The default mode is (open for reading text, a synonym of ). Modes and open and truncate the file. Modes and open the file with no truncation. As mentioned in the Overview, Python distinguishes between binary and text I/O. Files opened in binary mode (including in the mode argument) return contents as objects without any decoding. In text mode (the default, or when is included in the mode argument), the contents of the file are returned as , the bytes having been first decoded using a platform-dependent encoding or using the specified encoding if given. Python doesn’t depend on the underlying operating system’s notion of text files; all the processing is done by Python itself, and is therefore platform-independent. buffering is an optional integer used to set the buffering policy. Pass 0 to switch buffering off (only allowed in binary mode), 1 to select line buffering (only usable when writing in text mode), and an integer > 1 to indicate the size in bytes of a fixed-size chunk buffer. Note that specifying a buffer size this way applies for binary buffered I/O, but (i.e., files opened with ) would have another buffering. To disable buffering in , consider using the flag for . When no buffering argument is given, the default buffering policy works as follows:\n• None Binary files are buffered in fixed-size chunks; the size of the buffer is chosen using a heuristic trying to determine the underlying device’s “block size” and falling back on . On many systems, the buffer will typically be 4096 or 8192 bytes long.\n• None “Interactive” text files (files for which returns ) use line buffering. Other text files use the policy described above for binary files. encoding is the name of the encoding used to decode or encode the file. This should only be used in text mode. The default encoding is platform dependent (whatever returns), but any text encoding supported by Python can be used. See the module for the list of supported encodings. errors is an optional string that specifies how encoding and decoding errors are to be handled—this cannot be used in binary mode. A variety of standard error handlers are available (listed under Error Handlers), though any error handling name that has been registered with is also valid. The standard names include:\n• None to raise a exception if there is an encoding error. The default value of has the same effect.\n• None ignores errors. Note that ignoring encoding errors can lead to data loss.\n• None causes a replacement marker (such as ) to be inserted where there is malformed data.\n• None will represent any incorrect bytes as low surrogate code units ranging from U+DC80 to U+DCFF. These surrogate code units will then be turned back into the same bytes when the error handler is used when writing data. This is useful for processing files in an unknown encoding.\n• None is only supported when writing to a file. Characters not supported by the encoding are replaced with the appropriate XML character reference .\n• None (also only supported when writing) replaces unsupported characters with escape sequences. newline determines how to parse newline characters from the stream. It can be , , , , and . It works as follows:\n• None When reading input from the stream, if newline is , universal newlines mode is enabled. Lines in the input can end in , , or , and these are translated into before being returned to the caller. If it is , universal newlines mode is enabled, but line endings are returned to the caller untranslated. If it has any of the other legal values, input lines are only terminated by the given string, and the line ending is returned to the caller untranslated.\n• None When writing output to the stream, if newline is , any characters written are translated to the system default line separator, . If newline is or , no translation takes place. If newline is any of the other legal values, any characters written are translated to the given string. If closefd is and a file descriptor rather than a filename was given, the underlying file descriptor will be kept open when the file is closed. If a filename is given closefd must be (the default); otherwise, an error will be raised. A custom opener can be used by passing a callable as opener. The underlying file descriptor for the file object is then obtained by calling opener with (file, flags). opener must return an open file descriptor (passing as opener results in functionality similar to passing ). The following example uses the dir_fd parameter of the function to open a file relative to a given directory: 'This will be written to somedir/spamspam.txt' The type of file object returned by the function depends on the mode. When is used to open a file in a text mode ( , , , , etc.), it returns a subclass of (specifically ). When used to open a file in a binary mode with buffering, the returned class is a subclass of . The exact class varies: in read binary mode, it returns an ; in write binary and append binary modes, it returns an , and in read/write mode, it returns an . When buffering is disabled, the raw stream, a subclass of , , is returned. See also the file handling modules, such as , (where is declared), , , , and . The and arguments may have been modified or inferred from the original call.\n• None used to be raised, it is now an alias of .\n• None is now raised if the file opened in exclusive creation mode ( ) already exists.\n• None The file is now non-inheritable.\n• None If the system call is interrupted and the signal handler does not raise an exception, the function now retries the system call instead of raising an exception (see PEP 475 for the rationale).\n• None On Windows, opening a console buffer may return a subclass of other than . Changed in version 3.11: The mode has been removed.\n\nReturn a proxy object that delegates method calls to a parent or sibling class of type. This is useful for accessing inherited methods that have been overridden in a class. The object_or_type determines the method resolution order to be searched. The search starts from the class right after the type. For example, if of object_or_type is and the value of type is , then searches . The attribute of the class corresponding to object_or_type lists the method resolution search order used by both and . The attribute is dynamic and can change whenever the inheritance hierarchy is updated. If the second argument is omitted, the super object returned is unbound. If the second argument is an object, must be true. If the second argument is a type, must be true (this is useful for classmethods). When called directly within an ordinary method of a class, both arguments may be omitted (“zero-argument ”). In this case, type will be the enclosing class, and obj will be the first argument of the immediately enclosing function (typically ). (This means that zero-argument will not work as expected within nested functions, including generator expressions, which implicitly create nested functions.) There are two typical use cases for super. In a class hierarchy with single inheritance, super can be used to refer to parent classes without naming them explicitly, thus making the code more maintainable. This use closely parallels the use of super in other programming languages. The second use case is to support cooperative multiple inheritance in a dynamic execution environment. This use case is unique to Python and is not found in statically compiled languages or languages that only support single inheritance. This makes it possible to implement “diamond diagrams” where multiple base classes implement the same method. Good design dictates that such implementations have the same calling signature in every case (because the order of calls is determined at runtime, because that order adapts to changes in the class hierarchy, and because that order can include sibling classes that are unknown prior to runtime). For both use cases, a typical superclass call looks like this: # This does the same thing as: In addition to method lookups, also works for attribute lookups. One possible use case for this is calling descriptors in a parent or sibling class. Note that is implemented as part of the binding process for explicit dotted attribute lookups such as . It does so by implementing its own method for searching classes in a predictable order that supports cooperative multiple inheritance. Accordingly, is undefined for implicit lookups using statements or operators such as . Also note that, aside from the zero argument form, is not limited to use inside methods. The two argument form specifies the arguments exactly and makes the appropriate references. The zero argument form only works inside a class definition, as the compiler fills in the necessary details to correctly retrieve the class being defined, as well as accessing the current instance for ordinary methods.

This function is useful when you need to prompt the user for information or data that your program requires to perform a specific task.\n\nHow to Use the Function\n\nThe basic syntax for using the function is as follows:\n• The function displays the \"Prompt message\" to the user, which is a string that you provide to give the user an idea of what kind of input you're expecting.\n• The user then enters their input and presses the \"Enter\" key.\n• The user's input is captured and stored in the that you've specified.\n\nIn this example, the program prompts the user to enter their name, and then it prints a greeting message that includes the user's name.\n\nBy default, the function returns the user's input as a string. If you need to store the input as a different data type, such as an integer or a float, you'll need to convert the input using the appropriate data type function, like or .\n\nHere's an example of getting an integer input:\n\nIn this case, we use the function to convert the user's input to an integer, which is then stored in the variable.\n\nIf the user doesn't provide any input and just presses the \"Enter\" key, the function will return an empty string . You can handle this scenario by adding a check for empty input in your code:\n\nIn this example, we use the method to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the user's input before checking if it's an empty string.\n\nThe function in Python is a simple and powerful way to get user input. By understanding how to use it and handle different data types and edge cases, you can create more interactive and user-friendly Python programs."

Using the function, users can give any information to the application in the strings or numbers format.\n\nAfter reading this article, you will learn:\n• How to get input from the user, files, and display output on the screen, console, or write it into the file.\n• Take integer, float, character, and string input from a user.\n• Convert the user input to a different data type.\n\nIn Python 3, we have the following two built-in functions to handle input from a user and system.\n• : To display output on the console/screen.\n\nIn Python 2,we can use the following two functions:\n\nThe function reads a line entered on a console or screen by an input device such as a keyboard, converts it into a string. As a new developer, It is essential to understand what is input in Python.\n\nWhat is the input?\n\nThe input is a value provided by the system or user. For example, suppose you want to calculate the addition of two numbers on the calculator, you need to provide two numbers to the calculator. In that case, those two number is nothing but an input provided by the user to a calculator program.\n\nThere are different types of input devices we can use to provide data to application. For example: –\n• Stems from the keyboard: User entered some value using a keyboard.\n• Using mouse click or movement: The user clicked on the radio button or some drop-down list and chosen an option from it using mouse.\n\nIn Python, there are various ways for reading input from the user from the command line environment or through the user interface. In both cases, the user is sending information using the keyboard or mouse.\n\nPython Example to Accept Input From a User\n\nLet’s see how to accept employee information from a user.\n• First, ask employee name, salary, and company name from the user\n• Next, we will assign the input provided by the user to the variables\n• Finally, we will use the function to display those variables on the screen.\n• The argument is optional. The argument is used to display a message to the user. For example, the prompt is, “Please enter your name.”\n• When the function executes, the program waits until a user enters some value.\n• Next, the user enters some value on the screen using a keyboard.\n• Finally, The function reads a value from the screen, converts it into a string, and returns it to the calling program.\n\nNote: If you enter an integer or float number, still, it will convert it into a string. If you want to number input or input in other data types, you need to perform type conversion on the input value.\n\nLet’s understand this with an example.\n\nExample to check data type of input value\n\nAs you know whatever you enter as input, the function always converts it into a string.\n\nRead How to check if user input is a number or string.\n\nTake an Integer Number as input from User\n\nLet’s see how to accept an integer value from a user in Python. We need to convert an input string value into an integer using an function.\n\nNote: As you can see, we explicitly added a cast of an integer type to an input function to convert an input value to the integer type.\n\nNow if you print the type of first_number you should get integer type. will return\n\nTake Float Number as a Input from User\n\nSame as integer, we need to convert user input to the float number using the function\n\nGet Multiple inputs From a User in One Line\n\nIn Python, It is possible to get multiple values from the user in one line. We can accept two or three values from the user.\n\nFor example, in a single execution of the function, we can ask the user his/her name, age, and phone number and store it in three different variables.\n\nLet’ see how to do this.\n• Take each input separated by space\n• Split input string using get the value of individual input\n\nAlso, you can take the list as input from the user to get and store multiple values at a time.\n\nRead: How to take a list as an input from a user.\n\nAs you know, the function does not allow the user to provide values separated by a new line.\n\nIf the user tries to enter multiline input, it reads only the first line. Because whenever the user presses the enter key, the input function reads information provided by the user and stops execution.\n\nLet’s see how to gets multiple line input.\n\nWe can use a loop. In each iteration of the loop, we can get input strings from the user and join them. You can also concatenate each input string using the operator separated by newline ( ).\n• The function works differently between Python 3 and Python 2.\n• In Python 2, we can use both the and function to accept user input.\n• In Python 3, the function of Python 2 is renamed to and the original function is removed.\n\nThe difference between the and functions is relevant only when using Python 2.\n• The main difference between those two functions is function automatically converts user input to the appropriate type. i.e., If a user-entered string input() function converts it into a string, and if a user entered a number, it converts to an integer.\n• The convert every user input to a string.\n\nLet’s see how to use raw_input() in Python 2.\n\nExample 1: Python 2 function to take input from a user\n\nNote: As you can see, raw_input() converted all user values to string type.\n\nExample 2: Python 2 function to take input from a user\n\nNote: As you can see, input() converted all user values to appropriate data type.\n\nNote: To get the this behavior of input() in Python 3, use\n\nA command line interface (CLI) is a command screen or text interface called a shell that allows users to interact with a program.\n\nFor example, On windows, we use the Command Prompt and Bash on Linux. command line or command-line interface is a text-based application for viewing, handling, and manipulating files on our computer. The command line also called cmd, CLI, prompt, console, or terminal.\n\nOn command-line, we execute program or command by providing input/arguments to it. Also, output and error are displayed A command line.\n\nWe can run Python programs on the command line. The command line input is an argument that we pass to the program at runtime.\n\nPython provides following modules to work with command-line arguments.\n\nThe Python module is the basic module that implements command-line arguments in a simple structure named .\n• : The first argument is always the program/script name.\n\nWrite the below code in a file and save it as a\n\nRun the below command on the command line\n\nHere 10, 20, 30 are command-line arguments passed to the program. Each input represents a single argument.\n• The first argument, i.e., , always represents the Python program name ( ) file\n• The other list elements i.e., to are command-line arguments. Space is used to separate each argument.\n\nNote: is not an array. It is a list. This is a straightforward way to read command-line arguments as a string. See the following example to check the type of\n\nNow let’s see another example where we display all command-line arguments passed to the program.\n\nRun the below command on the command line\n\nNote : The space is separator between command line arguments.\n\nIn Python, by default, command-line arguments are available in string format. Based on our requirement, we can convert it into the corresponding type by using the typecasting method.\n\nSee the following example where we change the data type of arguments using the method.\n\nIf we try to access arguments with out of the range index on the command line, we will get an error.\n\nPython has a built-in function to display output to the standard output device like screen and console.\n\nExample 2: Display Output by separating each value\n\nMost of the time, we need to format output instead of merely printing space-separated values. For example, we want to display the string left-justified or in the center. We want to show the number in various formats.\n\nYou can display output in various styles and formats using the following functions.\n• The operator can also use for output formatting\n\nNow, Let see each one by one.\n• The is the string on which the format method is called. It can contain text or replacement fields delimited by braces {}.\n• Each replacement field contains either the numeric index of a positional argument present in the format method or the name of a keyword argument.\n• The format method returns a formatted string as an output. Each replacement field gets replaced with the actual string value of the corresponding argument present in the format method. i.e., args.\n\nLet see this with an example:\n\nNote: Here {0} and {1} is the numeric index of a positional argument present in the format method. i.e., {0} = Ault and {1} = Kelly. Anything that not enclosed in braces {} is considered a plain literal text.\n\nLet see different ways to display output using a method. You can find various Formatting options here.\n\nLet’s see how to use , and to justify text output on screen and console.\n\nTo practice what you learned in this article, I have created a Quiz and Exercise."

You use basic data types like , , and for numbers, for text, and for binary data, and for Boolean values. These data types form the core of most Python programs, allowing you to handle numeric, textual, and logical data efficiently.\n\nUnderstanding Python data types involves recognizing their roles and how to work with them. You can create and manipulate these data types using built-in functions and methods, and convert between them when necessary.\n\nBy the end of this tutorial, you’ll understand that:\n• You can check a variable’s type using the function in Python.\n• You can convert data types in Python using functions like , , , and others.\n• Despite being dynamically typed, Python does have data types.\n• The most essential data types in Python can be categorized as numeric, sequence, binary, and Boolean.\n\nIn this tutorial, you’ll learn the basics of each data type. To learn more about a specific data type, you’ll find useful resources in the corresponding section.\n\nInteger numbers are whole numbers with no decimal places. They can be positive or negative numbers. For example, , , , , , , and are all integers. Usually, you’ll use positive integer numbers to count things. In Python, the integer data type is represented by the class: In the following sections, you’ll learn the basics of how to create and work with integer numbers in Python. When you need to use integer numbers in your code, you’ll often use integer literals directly. Literals are constant values of built-in types spelled out literally, such as integers. Python provides a few different ways to create integer literals. The most common way is to use base-ten literals that look the same as integers look in math: Here, you have three integer numbers: a positive one, a negative one, and zero. Note that to create negative integers, you need to prepend the minus sign ( ) to the number. Python has no limit to how long an integer value can be. The only constraint is the amount of memory your system has. Beyond that, an integer can be as long as you need: For a really, really long integer, you can get a when converting it to a string: : use sys.set_int_max_str_digits() to increase the limit If you need to print an integer number beyond the 4300-digit limit, then you can use the function to increase the limit and make your code work. When you’re working with long integers, you can use the underscore character to make the literals more readable: With the underscore as a thousands separator, you can make your integer literals more readable for fellow programmers reading your code. You can also use other bases to represent integers. You can prepend the following characters to an integer value to indicate a base other than : or (Zero + b or B) or (Zero + o or O) or (Zero + x or X) Using the above characters, you can create integer literals using binary, octal, and hexadecimal representations. For example: Note that the underlying type of a Python integer is always . So, in all cases, the built-in function returns , irrespective of the base you use to build the literal. The built-in type has a few methods that you can use in some situations. Here’s a quick summary of these methods: Returns a pair of integers whose ratio is equal to the original integer and has a positive denominator Returns the number of ones in the binary representation of the absolute value of the integer Returns the number of bits necessary to represent an integer in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros Returns the integer represented by the given array of bytes Returns an array of bytes representing an integer When you call the method on an integer value, you get the integer as the numerator and as the denominator. As you’ll see in a moment, this method is more useful in floating-point numbers. Note that the type also has a method called , which always returns . This method exists for duck typing compatibility with floating-point numbers, which have the method as part of their public interface. Note: To access an integer method on a literal, you need to wrap the literal in parentheses: The parentheses are required because the dot character ( ) also defines floating-point numbers, as you’ll learn in a moment. If you don’t use the parentheses, then you get a . The and methods can help you when working on digital signal processing. For example, you may want every transmitted signal to have an even number of set bits: In this toy example, you use to ensure that the received signal has the correct parity. This way, you implement a basic error detection mechanism. Finally, the and methods can be useful in network programming. Often, you need to send and receive data over the network in binary format. To do this, you can use to convert the message for network transmission. Similarly, you can use to convert the message back. The built-in function provides another way to create integer values using different representations. With no arguments, the function returns : This feature makes especially useful when you need a factory function for classes like from the module. Note: In Python, the built-in functions associated with data types, such as , , , and , are classes with a function-style name. The Python documentation calls them functions, so you’ll follow that practice in this tutorial. However, keep in mind that something like is really a class constructor rather than a regular function. The function is commonly used to convert other data types into integers, provided that they’re valid numeric values: File , line , in : invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'one' In these examples, you first use to convert a floating-point number into an integer. Then, you convert a string into an integer. Note that when it comes to strings, you must ensure that the input string is a valid numeric value. Otherwise, you’ll get a exception. Note: When you use the function to convert floating-point numbers, you must be aware that the function just removes the decimal or fractional part. This function can take an additional argument called , which defaults to for decimal integers. This argument allows you to convert strings that represent integer values, which are expressed using a different base: In this case, the first argument must be a string representing an integer value with or without a prefix. Then, you must provide the appropriate base in the second argument to run the conversion. Once you call the function, you get the resulting integer value.\n\nFloating-point numbers, or just float, are numbers with a decimal place. For example, and are floating-point numbers. You can also have negative float numbers, such as . In Python, the name of the class represents floating-point numbers: In the following sections, you’ll learn the basics of how to create and work with floating-point numbers in Python. The type in Python designates floating-point numbers. To create these types of numbers, you can also use literals, similar to what you use in math. However, in Python, the dot character ( ) is what you must use to create floating-point literals: In these quick examples, you create floating-point numbers in three different ways. First, you have a literal build using an integer part, the dot, and the decimal part. You can also create a literal using the dot without specifying the decimal part, which defaults to . Finally, you make a literal without specifying the integer part, which also defaults to . You can also have negative float numbers: To create a negative floating-point number using a literal, you need to prepend the minus sign ( ) to the number. Similar to integer numbers, if you’re working with long floating-point numbers, you can use the underscore character as a thousands separator: By using an underscore, you can make your floating-point literals more readable for humans, which is great. Optionally, you can use the characters or followed by a positive or negative integer to express the number using scientific notation: By using the or character, you can represent any floating-point number using scientific notation, as you did in the above examples. Now, you can take a more in-depth look at how Python internally represents floating-point numbers. You can readily use floating-point numbers in Python without understanding them to this level, so don’t worry if this seems overly complicated. The information in this section is only meant to satisfy your curiosity. Note: For additional information on the floating-point representation in Python and the potential pitfalls, see Floating Point Arithmetic: Issues and Limitations in the Python documentation. Almost all platforms represent Python values as 64-bit (double-precision) values, according to the IEEE 754 standard. In that case, a floating-point number’s maximum value is approximately 1.8 ⨉ 10308. Python will indicate this number, and any numbers greater than that, by the string: The closest a nonzero number can be to zero is approximately 5.0 ⨉ 10-324. Anything closer to zero than that is effectively considered to be zero: Python internally represents floating-point numbers as binary (base-2) fractions. Most decimal fractions can’t be represented exactly as binary fractions. So, in most cases, the internal representation of a floating-point number is an approximation of its actual value. In practice, the difference between the actual and represented values is small and should be manageable. However, check out Make Python Lie to You for some challenges you should be aware of. The built-in type has a few methods and attributes which can be useful in some situations. Here’s a quick summary of them: Returns a pair of integers whose ratio is exactly equal to the original Returns if the float instance is finite with integral value, and otherwise The method on a value returns a pair of integers whose ratio equals the original number. You can use this method in scientific computations that require high precision. In these situations, you may need to avoid precision loss due to floating-point rounding errors. For example, say that you need to perform computations with the gravitational constant: With this exact ratio, you can perform calculations and prevent floating-point errors that may alter the results of your research. The method allows you to check whether a given value is an integer: When the number after the decimal point is , the method returns . Otherwise, it returns . Finally, the and methods allow you to work with floating-point values using a hexadecimal representation: The method returns a string that represents the target float value as a hexadecimal value. Note that is an instance method. The method takes a string that represents a floating-point number as an argument and builds an actual float number from it. In both methods, the hexadecimal string has the following format: In this template, apart from the identifier, the components are optional. Here’s what they mean:\n• defines whether the number is positive or negative. It may be either or . Only the sign is required because is the default.\n• is a string of hexadecimal digits representing the whole part of the number.\n• is a dot that separates the whole and fractional parts.\n• is a string of hexadecimal digits representing the fractional part of the number.\n• allows for adding an exponent value.\n• is a decimal integer with an optional leading sign. With these components, you’ll be able to create valid hexadecimal strings to process your floating-point numbers with the and methods. The built-in function provides another way to create floating-point values. When you call with no argument, then you get : Again, this feature of allows you to use it as a factory function. The function also helps you convert other data types into , provided that they’re valid numeric values: File , line , in : could not convert string to float: 'one' In these examples, you first use to convert an integer number into a float. Then, you convert a string into a float. Again, with strings, you need to make sure that the input string is a valid numeric value. Otherwise, you get a exception.\n\nPython has a built-in type for complex numbers. Complex numbers are composed of real and imaginary parts. They have the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers, and i is the imaginary unit. In Python, you’ll use a instead of an . For example: In this example, the argument to may look like an expression. However, it’s a literal of a complex number in Python. If you pass the literal to the function, then you’ll get the type back. Note: To dive deeper into complex numbers, check out the Simplify Complex Numbers With Python tutorial. In the following sections, you’ll learn the basics of creating complex numbers in Python. You’ll also explore the methods of this data type. In Python, you can define complex numbers using literals that look like , where is the real part, and is the imaginary part: As you can conclude from these examples, there are many ways to create complex numbers using literals. The key is that you need to use the letter in one of the components. Note that the can’t be used alone. If you try to do so, you get a exception because Python thinks that you’re creating an expression. Instead, you need to write . In Python, the type has a single method called . When you call this method on a complex number, you get the conjugate: The method flips the sign of the imaginary part, returning the complex conjugate. You can also use the built-in function to create complex numbers by providing the real and imaginary parts as arguments: When you call with no argument, you get . If you call the function with a single argument, that argument is the real part, and the imaginary part will be . If you want only the imaginary part, you can pass as the first argument. Note that you can also use negative numbers. In general, you can use integers and floating-point numbers as arguments to . You can also use to convert strings to complex numbers: : : complex() can't take second arg if first is a string To convert strings into complex numbers, you must provide a string that follows the format of complex numbers. For example, you can’t have spaces between the components. If you add spaces, then you get a exception. Finally, note that you can’t use strings to provide the imaginary part of complex numbers. If you do that, then you get a exception.\n\nBytes are immutable sequences of single bytes. In Python, the class allows you to build sequences of bytes. This data type is commonly used for manipulating binary data, encoding and decoding text, processing file input and output, and communicating through networks. Python also has a class as a mutable counterpart to objects: In the following sections, you’ll learn the basics of how to create and work with and objects in Python. To create a literal, you’ll use a syntax that’s largely the same as that for string literals. The difference is that you need to prepend a to the string literal. As with string literals, you can use different types of quotes to define bytes literals: 'This is a bytes literal in single quotes' \"This is a bytes literal in double quotes\" There is yet another difference between string literals and literals. To define bytes literals, you can only use ASCII characters. If you need to insert binary values over the 127 characters, then you have to use the appropriate escape sequence: In this example, is the escape sequence for the letter in the Spanish word . Note that if you try to use the directly, you get a . The built-in function provides another way to create objects. With no arguments, the function returns an empty object: You can use the function to convert string literals to objects: In these examples, you first use to convert a string into a object. Note that for this to work, you need to provide the appropriate character encoding. In this example, you use the UTF-8 encoding. If you try to convert a string literal without providing the encoding, then you get a exception. You can also use with an iterable of integers where each number is the Unicode code point of the individual characters: In this example, each number in the list you use as an argument to is the code point for a specific letter. For example, is the code point for , for , and so on. You can get the Unicode code point of any character using the built-in function. Note: To learn more about working with bytes objects, check out the Bytes Objects: Handling Binary Data in Python tutorial. Python doesn’t have dedicated literal syntax for objects. To create them, you’ll always use the class constructor , which is also known as a built-in function in Python. Here are a few examples of how to create objects using this function: In the first example, you call without an argument to create an empty object. In the second example, you call the function with an integer as an argument. In this case, you create a with five zero-filled items. Next, you use a list of code points to create a . This call works the same as with objects. Finally, you use a literal to build up the object. In Python, and objects are quite similar to strings. Instead of being sequences of characters, and objects are sequences of integer numbers, with values from to . Because of their similarities with strings, the and types support mostly the same methods as strings, so you won’t repeat them in this section. If you need detailed explanations of specific methods, then check out the Bytes and Bytearray Operations section in Python’s documentation. Finally, both and objects support the common sequence operations that you learned in the Common Sequence Operations on Strings section.\n\nBoolean logic relies on the truth value of expressions and objects. The truth value of an expression or object can take one of two possible values: true or false. In Python, these two values are represented by and , respectively: Both and are instances of the data type, which is built into Python. In the following sections, you’ll learn the basics about Python’s data type. Python provides a built-in Boolean data type. Objects of this type may have one of two possible values: or . These values are defined as built-in constants with values of and , respectively. In practice, the type is a subclass of . Therefore, and are also instances of : In Python, the type is a subclass of the type. It has only two possible values, and , which map to the constants and . These constant values are also the literals of the type: Boolean objects that are equal to are truthy, and those equal to are falsy. In Python, non-Boolean objects also have a truth value. In other words, Python objects are either truthy or falsy. You can use the built-in function to convert any Python object to a Boolean value. Internally, Python uses the following rules to identify falsy objects:\n• Constants that are defined to be false: and\n• The zero of any numeric type: , , , , The rest of the objects are considered truthy in Python. You can use the built-in function to explicitly learn the truth value of any Python object: In these examples, you use with arguments of different types. In each case, the function returns a Boolean value corresponding to the object’s truth value. Note: You rarely need to call yourself. Instead, you can rely on Python calling under the hood when necessary. For example, you can say instead of to check whether is truthy. You can also use the function with custom classes: By default, all instances of custom classes are true. If you want to modify this behavior, you can use the special method. Consider the following update of your class: The method returns when both coordinates are equal to and otherwise. Here’s how your class works now: Now, when both coordinates are , you get from calling . For the rest of the points, you get ."

        "document": "Python’s loop allows you to iterate over the items in a collection, such as lists, tuples, strings, and dictionaries. The loop syntax declares a loop variable that takes each item from the collection in each iteration. This loop is ideal for repeatedly executing a block of code on each item in the collection. You can also tweak loops further with features like , , and .\n\nBy the end of this tutorial, you’ll understand that:\n• Python’s loop iterates over items in a data collection, allowing you to execute code for each item.\n• To iterate from to , you use the construct.\n• To repeat code a number of times without processing the data of an iterable, use the construct.\n• To do index-based iteration, you can use for index, value in enumerate(iterable): to access both index and item.\n\nIn this tutorial, you’ll gain practical knowledge of using loops to traverse various collections and learn Pythonic looping techniques. Additionally, you’ll learn how to handle exceptions and how to use asynchronous iterations to make your Python code more robust and efficient.\n\nGetting Started With the Python Loop In programming, loops are control flow statements that allow you to repeat a given set of operations a number of times. In practice, you’ll find two main types of loops:\n• loops are mostly used to iterate a known number of times, which is common when you’re processing data collections with a specific number of data items.\n• loops are commonly used to iterate an unknown number of times, which is useful when the number of iterations depends on a given condition. Python has both of these loops and in this tutorial, you’ll learn about loops. In Python, you’ll generally use loops when you need to iterate over the items in a data collection. This type of loop lets you traverse different data collections and run a specific group of statements on or with each item in the input collection. In Python, loops are compound statements with a header and a code block that runs a predefined number of times. The basic syntax of a loop is shown below: In this syntax, is the loop variable. In each iteration, this variable takes the value of the current item in , which represents the data collection you need to iterate over. The loop body can consist of one or more statements that must be indented properly. Here’s a more detailed breakdown of this syntax:\n• is the keyword that initiates the loop header.\n• is a variable that holds the current item in the input iterable.\n• is a keyword that connects the loop variable with the iterable.\n• is a data collection that can be iterated over.\n• consists of one or more statements to execute in each iteration. Here’s a quick example of how you can use a loop to iterate over a list: In this example, is the loop variable, while the list is the target collection. Each time through the loop, takes on a successive item from . In this loop, the body consists of a call to that displays the value on the screen. This loop runs once for each item in the target iterable. The way the code above is written is the Pythonic way to write it. However, what’s an iterable anyway? In Python, an iterable is an object—often a data collection—that can be iterated over. Common examples of iterables in Python include lists, tuples, strings, dictionaries, and sets, which are all built-in data types. You can also have custom classes that support iteration. Note: Python has both iterables and iterators. Iterables support the iterable protocol consisting of the special method. Similarly, iterators support the iterator protocol that’s based on the and special methods. Both iterables and iterators can be iterated over. All iterators are iterables, but not all iterables are iterators. Python iterators play a fundamental role in loops because they drive the iteration process. A deeper discussion on iterables and iterators is beyond the scope of this tutorial. However, to learn more about them, check out the Iterators and Iterables in Python: Run Efficient Iterations tutorial. You can also have a loop with multiple loop variables: In this loop, you have two loop variables, and . Note that to use this syntax, you just need to provide a tuple of loop variables. Also, you can have as many loop variables as you need as long as you have the correct number of items to unpack into them. You’ll also find this pattern useful when iterating over dictionary items or when you need to do parallel iteration. Sometimes, the input iterable may be empty. In that case, the loop will run its header once but won’t execute its body: In this example, the target iterable is an empty list. The loop checks whether the iterable has items. If that’s the case, then the loop runs once for each item. If the iterable has no items, then the loop body doesn’t run, and the program’s execution flow jumps onto the statement after the loop. Now that you know the basic syntax of loops, it’s time to dive into some practical examples. In the following section, you’ll learn how to use loops with the most common built-in data collections in Python.\n\nWhen writing Python code, you’ll often need to iterate over built-in data types such as lists, tuples, strings, numeric ranges, dictionaries, and sets. All of them support iteration, and you can feed them into a loop. In the next sections, you’ll learn how to tackle this requirement in a Pythonic way. When it comes to iterating over sequence data types like lists, tuples, strings, and ranges, the iteration happens in the same order that the items appear in the sequence. Consider the following example where you iterate over the numbers in a list: In this example, the iteration goes through the list in the definition order, starting with and ending with . Note that to iterate over a sequence in Python, you don’t need to be aware of the index of each item as in other languages where loops often rely on indices. Often, you use plural nouns to name lists. This naming practice allows you to use singular nouns as the loop variable, making your code descriptive and readable. Note: To learn more about using lists, check out Python’s Data Type: A Deep Dive With Examples. You’ll note the same behavior with other built-in sequences: In these examples, you iterate over a tuple, string, and numeric range. Again, the loop traverses the sequence in the order of definition. Note: For more information about tuples, strings, and ranges, you can check out the following tutorials: Tuples are often used to represent rows of data. In the example above, the tuple holds data about a person. You can iterate over each field using a readable loop. When it comes to iterating over string objects, the loop lets you process the string on a character-by-character basis. Finally, iterating over a numeric range is sometimes a requirement, especially when you need to iterate a given number of times and need control over the consecutive index. When traversing dictionaries with a loop, you’ll find that you can iterate over the keys, values, and items of the dictionary at hand. Note: To learn more about dictionary iteration, check out the How to Iterate Through a Dictionary in Python tutorial. You’ll have two different ways to iterate over the keys of a dictionary. You can either use: The following examples show how to use these two approaches: In these examples, you first iterate over the keys of a dictionary using the dictionary directly in the loop header. In the second loop, you use the method to iterate over the keys. While both approaches are equivalent, the first one is more commonly used, whereas the second might be more readable and explicit. In both loops, you can access the dictionary values using the keys: To access the values in this type of iteration, you can use the original dictionary and a key lookup operation, as shown in the highlighted line. You can use the method to feed the loop when you need to iterate over the values of a dictionary: The method lets you traverse the values in the target dictionary. In this example, you iterate over team names one by one. Note that when you use the method, you can’t access the dictionary keys. Finally, iterating over both keys and values in a Python dictionary is a common requirement. In this case, the recommended and most Pythonic approach is to use the method in a loop like the following: When iterating over keys and values this way, you typically use a tuple of loop variables. The first variable will get the key, while the second will get the associated value. In this example, you have the and variables, which make the code clear and readable. When it comes to iterating over sets, you only have to keep in mind that sets are unordered data types. This means that looping in order isn’t guaranteed: As you can see, the loop goes through the elements of your set in a different order than they were inserted. So, you can’t rely on the order of the elements when traversing sets in Python.\n\nThe Python loop has some advanced features that make it flexible and powerful. These features can be helpful when you need to fine-tune the loop to meet specific execution flows. These features include the and statements and the clause, which you’ll learn about in the following sections. You’ll also learn that loops can be nested inside one another. This feature can be pretty useful in situations where you need to iterate over nested data structures like lists of lists. The statement immediately exits the loop and jumps to the first statement after the loop. For example, say that you want to write a loop to determine whether a number is in a list. To avoid unnecessary work, the loop should terminate once it finds the target value. You can do this with the statement: In this example, the statement jumps out of the loop as soon as the target number is found. The remaining values, and , aren’t processed. You can think of the statement as a way to short-circuit the loop execution once you’ve gotten the desired result. It’s important to note that it makes little sense to have statements outside conditionals. Suppose you include a statement directly in the loop body without wrapping it in a conditional. In that case, the loop will terminate in the first iteration, potentially without running the entire loop body. The statement terminates the current iteration and proceeds to the next one. For example, if you have a list of numbers and only want to process the even ones, you can use a statement to skip the odd numbers: In this example, the code that processes the numbers is only reached if the number is even. Otherwise, the statement skips that code and jumps right into the next iteration. Again, it doesn’t make much sense to have a statement without wrapping it in a conditional. If you do so, the code after the statement will be unreachable and never run. In Python, loops can have an clause at the end. The clause will only run if the loop terminates because of the exhaustion of the input iterable. This feature is useful when you have a statement that can terminate the loop in certain situations. If the loop doesn’t break, then you can run additional code in the clause. To illustrate, say that you want to continue improving the loop that determines whether a number is in a list. You’d like to explicitly inform the user if the number isn’t in the list. You can do this with the clause: The clause won’t run if the loop breaks out with the statement. It only runs if the loop terminates normally, allowing you to inform the user that the target number wasn’t found. It doesn’t make sense to have an clause in a loop that doesn’t have a statement. In that case, placing the block’s content after the loop—without indentation—will work the same and be cleaner. You can also have nested loops. In the example below, you create a multiplication table that shows the products of all combinations of integers up to ten using nested loops. The outer loop iterates over the numbers between and , and the inner loop calculates and prints the products: In this example, you use two nested loops. Together, they create a two-dimensional multiplication table. First, you loop over the numbers from one up to and including ten. These represent the rows in the table, and you can see those numbers at the beginning of each row. In the inner loop, you calculate the products for the current by iterating from the itself up to its tenth multiple. Then, you format each product using the format specifier. This ensures the table is nicely aligned. By setting to an empty string, you skip the newline until the products on the current row are printed. After printing all products for a row, you use without arguments to move to the next row.\n\nWhen people switch from other programming languages to Python, they often write loops like they did in their previous language. This practice makes Python code look odd and hard to read. In the following sections, you’ll explore some looping techniques, practices, and tips that are considered Pythonic. These techniques can make your Python code look clearer, more elegant, and more efficient. Iterating With Indices: The Pythonic Way Sometimes, you need to use the indices of items when you iterate over a sequence with a Python loop. Up to this point, you’ve seen examples where you can access the items but don’t know their corresponding indices. To get both the item and its index, you can end up writing a loop like the one shown in the following example: This loop gets the job done, but it’s not as clean or readable as you’d expect from Python code. Fortunately, there’s a better way—the built-in function: The function takes an iterable as an argument and generates tuples of the form . Note that the loop reads almost like plain English, which makes your code way more Pythonic than the previous version using . Note: To learn more about working with , check out the Python : Simplify Loops That Need Counters tutorial. The function also takes an optional argument called that lets you tweak the initial value. This feature is useful when you need to create counts. Consider the following example that mimics an option menu for a command-line application: In this example, instead of using to produce zero-based indices, you start the count at . From the end user’s perspective, starting the menu at is the natural way to go. Looping Over Several Iterables in Parallel Looping through two or more iterables in parallel may be another common task you encounter in Python programming. To do this, you can use the built-in function, which takes two or more iterables and yields tuples that combine items from each iterable. Note: To learn more about , check out the Using the Python zip() Function for Parallel Iteration tutorial. Consider the following toy example: In this example, you use to create an iterator that produces tuples of the form . In this case, the values are taken from , and the values are taken from . There may be times when you need to iterate over multiple iterables sequentially in a single loop. In such cases, you can use the function from Python’s module. Note: To learn more about the module and the tools it provides, check out the Python By Example tutorial. For example, say that you have several lists of numbers and want to calculate the square of each number in all lists. You can use as follows: This loops over all three lists in sequence and prints the square of each value. You can also use to work through a list of lists. Say that you, again, need to process each value in a sequence and calculate its square: In this example, you use to iterate over the rows of the matrix. To feed the rows into , you use the unpacking operator ( ). Inside the loop, you calculate and print the square of each value. Using , like in this example, essentially flattens the matrix into a single iterable, helping you avoid a nested loop, which can be difficult to read and understand in some contexts. Iteration is all about repeating some fragment of code multiple times. As you’ve learned so far, loops are designed to repeat a given set of actions on the items of an iterable. However, you can also use this type of loop to quickly iterate a specific number of times. This is useful when you need to repeat a bunch of statements, but they don’t operate on the items of an iterable. Here’s a fun example about Penny and Sheldon to illustrate this: This loop runs three times and repeats a series of statements that don’t operate on any iterable. Note that the loop variable is a single underscore character in this example. This variable name communicates that you don’t need to use the loop variable inside the loop. It’s a throwaway variable. With this looping construct that takes advantage of , you have full control over the number of times your code runs. Iterating over the items of an iterable in reverse or sorted order is also a common requirement in programming. To achieve this, you can combine a loop with the built-in or function, respectively. Note: To learn more about and , check out the following tutorials:\n• Reverse Strings in Python: , Slicing, and More\n• How to Use and in Python For example, say that you’re working on a text editor and want to implement a basic Undo option. You can implement it with the function and a loop like the following: In this example, you have a list of hypothetical user actions in a text editor. The actions are stored in a list from oldest to newest. To implement the Undo operation, you need to reverse the actions, which you do with . To iterate in sorted order, say that you have a dictionary that maps student names to their corresponding average grades. You need to create a quick report and want to sort the data from highest to lowest grades. For this, you can do something like the following: The function returns a list of sorted values. In this example, you sort the dictionary by its values in ascending order. To do this, you use a function that takes a two-value tuple as an argument and returns the second item, which has an index of . You also set the argument to so that the function stores the data in reverse order. In this case, this means that the grades are ordered in descending order. The loop iterates over the sorted data and generates a nicely formatted report using an f-string with a custom format specifier.\n\nWhen working with loops in your Python code, you may encounter some issues related to incorrect ways to use this tool. Some of the most common bad practices and incorrect assumptions include:\n• Modifying the loop collection or iterable during iteration\n• Changing the loop variable to affect the underlying collection\n• Ignoring possible exceptions that may occur In the following sections, you’ll explore these pitfalls and how to avoid them in your loops. Python has mutable collections, such as lists and dictionaries, that you can modify in place. You may want to change a list while looping over it. In this situation, you need to distinguish between safe and unsafe changes. For example, say that you have a list of names and want to convert them into uppercase. You may think of doing something like the following: In this example, you only change the existing items in the list without adding or removing any. This operation is safe. However, modifying a mutable iterable like a list while iterating over it always raises a warning. Issues may appear when you add or remove items from a list while iterating over it. To understand why this is best avoided, say that you want to remove all the even numbers from a list. You might write the following code: After running the loop, some even numbers remain, even though you expected the list to be empty. On the first iteration, is removed, and the list shifts left, becoming . The loop then jumps to the next item, skipping and processing instead. Then is removed, and the list shifts again, becoming . The iteration ends before reaching . When you need to resize a list during iteration like in the example above, it’s recommended to create a copy of the list: The slicing operator ( ) with no indices creates a copy of the original list for iteration purposes. The loop traverses the copy while removing values from the original list. In some cases, creating a copy of the input list isn’t enough. Say that on top of removing even numbers, you want to calculate the square of odd numbers. You might modify the previous loop as shown in the following code: This time, you use to generate index-item pairs. Then, you think of using the index to update the value of a given item. However, the code fails with a exception. Creating a copy of the input list isn’t enough in this case. You’d have to make a separate list to store the result: In this new loop implementation, you’re using a new list to store the result. Because of this, you don’t have to remove items anymore. You add the square values to the end of the new list using the method. Python doesn’t allow you to add or remove items from a dictionary while you’re iterating through it: If you try to expand or shrink a dictionary during iteration, you get a exception. Again, you can work around this by creating a copy of the dictionary using the method or by building a new dictionary with the resulting data. Changing the loop variable in the loop body doesn’t have an effect on the original data: In this example, the highlighted line changes the loop variable, . This change doesn’t affect the original data in your list of names. The loop variable is just a temporary reference to the current item in the iterable, and reassigning it doesn’t affect the loop iterable. If an exception occurs in a loop body and isn’t handled, the loop will terminate prematurely, skipping subsequent iterations. This result can generate unexpected issues, especially when you rely on the loop to process data, perform logging, or run cleanup actions in each iteration. As an example, say that you want to process some text files in a loop: : [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'file1.txt' In this example, none of the files exist in your working directory. The loop tries to process the first file and fails with a exception. Because the exception wasn’t handled properly, the loop terminates in the first iteration, skipping the rest of the files in the list. To avoid this behavior, you need to catch and handle the exception: In this new implementation, the loop catches any exception and prints an error message to the screen. The loop runs entirely without abrupt interruptions."

        "document": "Loops in Python are used to repeat actions efficiently. The main types are For loops (counting through items) and While loops (based on conditions). Additionally, Nested Loops allow looping within loops for more complex tasks. While all the ways provide similar basic functionality, they differ in their syntax and condition-checking time. In this article, we will look at Python loops and understand their working with the help of examples.\n\nIn Python, a while loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied. When the condition becomes false, the line immediately after the loop in the program is executed.\n\nAll the statements indented by the same number of character spaces after a programming construct are considered to be part of a single block of code. Python uses indentation as its method of grouping statements.\n\nExample of Python While Loop:\n\nUsing else statement with While Loop in Python\n\nElse clause is only executed when our while condition becomes false. If we break out of the loop or if an exception is raised then it won’t be executed.\n\nSyntax of While Loop with else statement:\n\nThe code prints “Hello Geek” three times using a ‘while’ loop and then after the loop it prints “In Else Block” because there is an “else” block associated with the ‘while’ loop.\n\nIf we want a block of code to execute infinite number of times then we can use the while loop in Python to do so.\n\nThe code given below uses a ‘while’ loop with the condition (count == 0) and this loop will only run as long as count is equal to 0. Since count is initially set to 0, the loop will execute indefinitely because the condition is always true.\n\nNote: It is suggested not to use this type of loop as it is a never-ending infinite loop where the condition is always true and we have to forcefully terminate the compiler.\n\nFor loops are used for sequential traversal. For example: traversing a list or string or array etc. In Python, there is “for in” loop which is similar to foreach loop in other languages. Let us learn how to use for loops in Python for sequential traversals with examples.\n\nExplanation: This code prints the numbers from 0 to 3 (inclusive) using a for loop that iterates over a range from 0 to n-1 (where n = 4).\n\nExample with List, Tuple, String, and Dictionary Iteration Using for Loops in Python\n\nWe can use for loop to iterate lists, tuples, strings and dictionaries in Python.\n\nIterating by the Index of Sequences\n\nWe can also use the index of elements in the sequence to iterate. The key idea is to first calculate the length of the list and in iterate over the sequence within the range of this length.\n\nExplanation: This code iterates through each element of the list using its index and prints each element one by one. The range(len(list)) generates indices from 0 to the length of the list minus 1.\n\nUsing else Statement with for Loop in Python\n\nWe can also combine else statement with for loop like in while loop. But as there is no condition in for loop based on which the execution will terminate so the else block will be executed immediately after for block finishes execution.\n\nExplanation: The code iterates through the list and prints each element. After the loop ends it prints “Inside Else Block” as the else block executes when the loop completes without a break.\n\nPython programming language allows to use one loop inside another loop which is called nested loop. Following section shows few examples to illustrate the concept.\n\nThe syntax for a nested while loop statement in the Python programming language is as follows:\n\nA final note on loop nesting is that we can put any type of loop inside of any other type of loops in Python. For example, a for loop can be inside a while loop or vice versa.\n\nExplanation: In the above code we use nested loops to print the value of i multiple times in each row, where the number of times it prints i increases with each iteration of the outer loop. The print() function prints the value of i and moves to the next line after each row.\n\nLoop control statements change execution from their normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed. Python supports the following control statements.\n\nThe continue statement in Python returns the control to the beginning of the loop.\n\nExplanation: The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It is useful when we want to bypass certain conditions without terminating the loop.\n\nThe break statement in Python brings control out of the loop.\n\nExplanation: break statement is used to exit the loop prematurely when a specified condition is met. In this example, the loop breaks when the letter is either ‘e’ or ‘s’, stopping further iteration.\n\nWe use pass statement in Python to write empty loops. Pass is also used for empty control statements, functions and classes.\n\nExplanation: In this example, the loop iterates over each letter in ‘geeksforgeeks’ but doesn’t perform any operation, and after the loop finishes, the last letter (‘s’) is printed.\n\nHow for loop works internally in Python?\n\nBefore proceeding to this section, we should have a prior understanding of Python Iterators.\n\nFirstly, lets see how a simple for loops in Python looks like.\n\nExample: This Python code iterates through a list called fruits, containing “apple”, “orange” and “kiwi.” It prints each fruit name on a separate line, displaying them in the order they appear in the list.\n\nThis code iterates over each item in the fruits list and prints the item (fruit) on each iteration and the output will display each fruit on a new line.\n\nThis Python code manually iterates through a list of fruits using an iterator. It prints each fruit’s name one by one and stops when there are no more items in the list.\n\nWe can see that under the hood we are calling iter() and next() method.\n• None Difference between for loop and while loop in Python\n• None Use for Loop That Loops Over a Sequence in Python\n\nWhich loop is faster in Python?\n\nWhy is Python slow in loops?\n\nHow many loops are used in Python?\n\nIs for loop bad in Python?"

Strings are also a type of iterator--in fact, strings are simply arrays of characters. Think of it like a regular list, but instead of having a list like , you have the list . So each iteration of the for loop only prints the character it is currently iterating on.\n\nYou could simplify your code by avoiding the for loop and only using the code .\n\nHowever, if you only want to practice with for loops, you can use the code below.
