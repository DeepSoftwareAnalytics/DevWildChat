Once the user clicks on that button, the print dialog of the browser will open, but it will not print the webpage. Instead, it will print the some other HTML content which is not displayed on the page.\n\nWhile asking this question, there are few solutions coming into my mind. But I am not sure whether those are good ideas or something better can be done. One of those solutions are: I can keep this HTML content in a div and make it to print, but to screen. All other elements on the webpage can be made to for print and for the screen. And then call to print."

        "document": "When the print function in javascript is called, it prints the Web Page and opens a dialog box(the same thing that appears when we press CTRL + P in any application, such as Microsoft Word) in the browser where we can use the printing options and print the content using a printing device, such as a printer, or save it as a PDF or other in another printing format supported by the operating system. It is globally available in Javascript.\n\nThe syntax of the print function in javascript is simple, or, We can omit the window object here because by default we can access all global functions.\n\nBelow is an example that shows how the execution of this method looks like,\n• Here we have a simple HTML file containing some HTML elements like heading and button.\n• With the button, we have used the onclick event attribute to associate the functionality with being executed when the click event gets fired.\n• When we click on the button the click event occurs and the window.print() statement executes.\n• Consequently, it prints the content of the web page.\n\nThe print() method exists on the global window object of javascript, it is globally accessible inside the browser. When called it prints the entire content of the web page. The browser opens the dialog box to print the page, where we can use the printing options like we can select the printer, save as a pdf, and we can change the pages to be printed, etc.\n\nIn this example, we just like to print the entire web page's content.\n• In this example we have created an HTML file, which contains some HTML content as well as a small script to write the required javascript functionality.\n• The body tag contains two heading tags and some content related to web technologies.\n• In the end there is a button for which we have provided a function to onclick event attribute, which means this function will be executed on the click event for the button.\n• The function is defined in the script tag written inside the head tag.\n• The function definition is pretty simple, it just contains a single statement.\n• Call to print function in javascript with window object starts the execution of underlying functionality and subsequently it prints the content of web page. If we include images in the HTML, they will be printed as well because they are part of the HTML content. Also, since the button is only used for printing and is not included in the content, we would like to remove it from the actual print.\n• This example is also similar to the last one, the few key differences are, that here we have an image instead of text content.\n• Also the script which is being used to execute the print method is a little bit modified.\n• Inside the function definition, we are accessing our button with the element ID.\n• Now, after accessing the actual Element from the DOM, we can manipulate the content, style, etc.\n• So, we are changing its display style to none, before the call to print method.\n• In this way we can avoid this button being printed.\n• But the changes to the style should only be limited till the function call, that's why again we are changing the display to block so that button could be visible again."

        "document": "JavaScript is a versatile programming language that allows developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications. One common task in web development is to refresh or reload a web page, either to update its content or to trigger certain actions.\n\nIn this article, we will explore different ways to refresh a page in JavaScript and understand the pros and cons of each approach.\n\nRefreshing a web page can be useful in various scenarios. For example:\n• None Content Update: If the content on a web page is dynamic and changes frequently, you may need to refresh the page to display the latest data or information. This is commonly seen in news websites, stock market trackers, weather apps, and so on.\n• None Form Submission: After submitting a form on a web page, you may want to refresh the page to show a success message or reset the form for a new submission.\n• None State Reset: In some cases, you may want to reset the state of a web page or clear certain data to start fresh. Refreshing the page can help achieve this.\n\nNow, let's explore different ways to refresh a page in JavaScript.\n\nMethod 1: How to Refresh the Page Using\n\nThe simplest way to refresh a page in JavaScript is to use the method. This method reloads the current web page from the server, discarding the current content and loading the latest content.\n• None It's straightforward and easy to use.\n• None It reloads the entire page from the server, ensuring that you get the latest content.\n• None It discards the current content of the page, which can result in loss of user input or data.\n• None It may cause a flickering effect as the page reloads, which can impact user experience.\n\nMethod 2: How to Refresh the Page Using\n\nAnother way to refresh a page in JavaScript is to use the method.

This effectively reloads the page with the new URL, triggering a page refresh.\n• None It's a simple and effective way to refresh the page.\n• None It preserves the current content of the page and only updates the URL, avoiding loss of user input or data.\n• None It replaces the entire URL of the page, which may result in the loss of the current browsing history.\n• None It may not work in some scenarios, such as when the web page was opened in a new window or tab.\n\nMethod 5: How to Refresh the Page Using with a Delay\n\nIf you want to add a delay before refreshing the page, you can use the function in combination with the method.\n\nThis allows you to specify a time interval in milliseconds before the page is reloaded, giving you control over the timing of the refresh.\n\nPros of Using location.reload() with a Delay\n• None It allows you to control the timing of the page refresh by adding a delay.\n• None It provides flexibility in scenarios where you want to refresh the page after a certain event or action.\n\nCons of Using location.reload() with a Delay\n• None It may cause a delay in the page refresh, which can impact user experience.\n• None It may not work as expected in scenarios with unstable or slow network connections.\n\nIn this article, you have learned the different ways to refresh a page in JavaScript. Each method has its pros and cons, which should make it easier for you to choose the best method for your web development project.\n\nWhen using any of these methods to refresh a page, it's important to consider the impact on user experience, data loss, and browsing history.\n\nI hope this article helps you understand how to reload a web page in JavaScript and choose the appropriate method for your specific use case.\n\nEmbark on a journey of learning!

In case you'd like to use session storage only when a button in the page is clicked and not when reloading with the browser button, you can use or once you've executed the function after loading the window.\n\nSo, let's say we have:\n\nSet restart boolean to true as a session storage and reload:\n\nOnce the window is reloaded we can execute the following function:\n\nSo, if now the user reloads the page with the browser button it will reload with the session storage cleaned. Meaning, no functions will be executed after window load."
