Note that is not quite right, because directories are not files (except in the unix sense that everything is a file).\n\nSo we need to use :\n\nHere's the help on :\n\nSo let's get a file that we know is a file:\n\nBy default, deletes the file when closed (and will automatically close when no more references exist to it).\n\nIf you dig into the implementation, though, you'll see that uses :\n\nRace Conditions: Why we like try\n\nWe like because it avoids race conditions. With , you simply attempt to read your file, expecting it to be there, and if not, you catch the exception and perform whatever fallback behavior makes sense.\n\nIf you want to check that a file exists before you attempt to read it, and you might be deleting it and then you might be using multiple threads or processes, or another program knows about that file and could delete it - you risk the chance of a race condition if you check it exists, because you are then racing to open it before its condition (its existence) changes.\n\nRace conditions are very hard to debug because there's a very small window in which they can cause your program to fail.\n\nBut if this is your motivation, you can get the value of a statement by using the context manager.\n\nPython 3.4 gives us the context manager (previously the context manager), which does semantically exactly the same thing in fewer lines, while also (at least superficially) meeting the original ask to avoid a statement:\n\nFor earlier Pythons, you could roll your own , but without a will be more verbose than with. I do believe this actually is the only answer that doesn't use at any level in the Python that can be applied to prior to Python 3.4 because it uses a context manager instead:\n\nPerhaps easier with a try:\n\nOther options that don't meet the ask for \"without try\":\n\nBut if you examine the source of this function, you'll see it actually does use a try statement:\n\nAll it's doing is using the given path to see if it can get stats on it, catching and then checking if it's a file if it didn't raise the exception.\n\nIf you intend to do something with the file, I would suggest directly attempting it with a try-except to avoid a race condition:\n\nAvailable for Unix and Windows is , but to use you must pass flags, and it does not differentiate between files and directories. This is more used to test if the real invoking user has access in an elevated privilege environment:\n\nIt also suffers from the same race condition problems as . From the docs:\n\nNote: Using access() to check if a user is authorized to e.g. open a file before actually doing so using open() creates a security hole, because the user might exploit the short time interval between checking and opening the file to manipulate it. It’s preferable to use EAFP techniques. For example: if os.access(\"myfile\", os.R_OK): with open(\"myfile\") as fp: return fp.read() return \"some default data\" try: fp = open(\"myfile\") except IOError as e: if e.errno == errno.EACCES: return \"some default data\" # Not a permission error. raise else: with fp: return fp.read()\n\nAvoid using . It is a low level function that has more opportunities for user error than the higher level objects and functions discussed above.\n\nAnother answer says this about :\n\nThis answer says it prefers a non-Pythonic, error-prone method, with no justification. It seems to encourage users to use low-level APIs without understanding them.\n\nIt also creates a context manager which, by unconditionally returning , allows all Exceptions (including and !) to pass silently, which is a good way to hide bugs.\n\nThis seems to encourage users to adopt poor practices."

        "document": "Strictly Python 3. That's just how we roll.\n\nThe question of \"How do I test pathname validity and, for valid pathnames, the existence or writability of those paths?\" is clearly two separate questions. Both are interesting, and neither have received a genuinely satisfactory answer here... or, well, anywhere that I could grep.\n\nvikki's answer probably hews the closest, but has the remarkable disadvantages of:\n• Needlessly opening (...and then failing to reliably close) file handles.\n• Needlessly writing (...and then failing to reliable close or delete) 0-byte files.\n• Ignoring OS-specific errors differentiating between non-ignorable invalid pathnames and ignorable filesystem issues. Unsurprisingly, this is critical under Windows. (See below.)\n• Ignoring race conditions resulting from external processes concurrently (re)moving parent directories of the pathname to be tested. (See below.)\n• Ignoring connection timeouts resulting from this pathname residing on stale, slow, or otherwise temporarily inaccessible filesystems. This could expose public-facing services to potential DoS-driven attacks. (See below.)\n\nWe're gonna fix all that.\n\nBefore hurling our fragile meat suits into the python-riddled moshpits of pain, we should probably define what we mean by \"pathname validity.\" What defines validity, exactly?\n\nBy \"pathname validity,\" we mean the syntactic correctness of a pathname with respect to the root filesystem of the current system – regardless of whether that path or parent directories thereof physically exist. A pathname is syntactically correct under this definition if it complies with all syntactic requirements of the root filesystem.\n\nBy \"root filesystem,\" we mean:\n• On POSIX-compatible systems, the filesystem mounted to the root directory ( ).\n• On Windows, the filesystem mounted to , the colon-suffixed drive letter containing the current Windows installation (typically but not necessarily ).\n\nThe meaning of \"syntactic correctness,\" in turn, depends on the type of root filesystem. For (and most but not all POSIX-compatible) filesystems, a pathname is syntactically correct if and only if that pathname:\n• Contains no null bytes (i.e., in Python). This is a hard requirement for all POSIX-compatible filesystems.\n• Contains no path components longer than 255 bytes (e.g., in Python). A path component is a longest substring of a pathname containing no character (e.g., , , , and in the pathname ).\n\nQuestion #1: How Now Shall We Do Pathname Validity?\n\nValidating pathnames in Python is surprisingly non-intuitive. I'm in firm agreement with Fake Name here: the official package should provide an out-of-the-box solution for this. For unknown (and probably uncompelling) reasons, it doesn't. Fortunately, unrolling your own ad-hoc solution isn't that gut-wrenching...\n\nO.K., it actually is. It's hairy; it's nasty; it probably chortles as it burbles and giggles as it glows. But what you gonna do? Nuthin'.\n\nWe'll soon descend into the radioactive abyss of low-level code. But first, let's talk high-level shop. The standard and functions raise the following exceptions when passed invalid pathnames:\n• For pathnames residing in non-existing directories, instances of .\n• For pathnames residing in existing directories:\n• Under Windows, instances of whose attribute is (i.e., ).\n• Under all other OSes:\n• For pathnames containing null bytes (i.e., ), instances of .\n• For pathnames containing path components longer than 255 bytes, instances of whose attribute is:\n• Under SunOS and the *BSD family of OSes, . (This appears to be an OS-level bug, otherwise referred to as \"selective interpretation\" of the POSIX standard.)\n• Under all other OSes, .\n\nCrucially, this implies that only pathnames residing in existing directories are validatable. The and functions raise generic exceptions when passed pathnames residing in non-existing directories, regardless of whether those pathnames are invalid or not. Directory existence takes precedence over pathname invalidity.\n\nDoes this mean that pathnames residing in non-existing directories are not validatable? Yes – unless we modify those pathnames to reside in existing directories. Is that even safely feasible, however? Shouldn't modifying a pathname prevent us from validating the original pathname?\n\nTo answer this question, recall from above that syntactically correct pathnames on the filesystem contain no path components (A) containing null bytes or (B) over 255 bytes in length. Hence, an pathname is valid if and only if all path components in that pathname are valid. This is true of most real-world filesystems of interest.\n\nDoes that pedantic insight actually help us? Yes. It reduces the larger problem of validating the full pathname in one fell swoop to the smaller problem of only validating all path components in that pathname. Any arbitrary pathname is validatable (regardless of whether that pathname resides in an existing directory or not) in a cross-platform manner by following the following algorithm:\n• Split that pathname into path components (e.g., the pathname into the list ).\n• For each such component:\n• Join the pathname of a directory guaranteed to exist with that component into a new temporary pathname (e.g., ) .\n• Pass that pathname to or . If that pathname and hence that component is invalid, this call is guaranteed to raise an exception exposing the type of invalidity rather than a generic exception. Why? Because that pathname resides in an existing directory. (Circular logic is circular.)\n\nIs there a directory guaranteed to exist? Yes, but typically only one: the topmost directory of the root filesystem (as defined above).\n\nPassing pathnames residing in any other directory (and hence not guaranteed to exist) to or invites race conditions, even if that directory was previously tested to exist. Why? Because external processes cannot be prevented from concurrently removing that directory after that test has been performed but before that pathname is passed to or . Unleash the dogs of mind-fellating insanity!\n\nThere exists a substantial side benefit to the above approach as well: security. (Isn't that nice?) Specifically:\n\nThe above approach obviates this by only validating the path components of a pathname against the root directory of the root filesystem. (If even that's stale, slow, or inaccessible, you've got larger problems than pathname validation.)\n\nLost? Great. Let's begin. (Python 3 assumed. See \"What Is Fragile Hope for 300, leycec?\")\n\nDone. Don't squint at that code. (It bites.)\n\nTesting the existence or creatability of possibly invalid pathnames is, given the above solution, mostly trivial. The little key here is to call the previously defined function before testing the passed path:\n\nDone and done. Except not quite.\n\nThere exists a caveat. Of course there does.\n\nAs the official documentation admits:\n\nTo no one's surprise, Windows is the usual suspect here. Thanks to extensive use of Access Control Lists (ACL) on NTFS filesystems, the simplistic POSIX permission-bit model maps poorly to the underlying Windows reality. While this (arguably) isn't Python's fault, it might nonetheless be of concern for Windows-compatible applications.\n\nIf this is you, a more robust alternative is wanted. If the passed path does not exist, we instead attempt to create a temporary file guaranteed to be immediately deleted in the parent directory of that path – a more portable (if expensive) test of creatability:\n\nNote, however, that even this may not be enough.\n\nThanks to User Access Control (UAC), the ever-inimicable Windows Vista and all subsequent iterations thereof blatantly lie about permissions pertaining to system directories. When non-Administrator users attempt to create files in either the canonical or directories, UAC superficially permits the user to do so while actually isolating all created files into a \"Virtual Store\" in that user's profile. (Who could have possibly imagined that deceiving users would have harmful long-term consequences?)\n\nThis is crazy. This is Windows.\n\nDare we? It's time to test-drive the above tests.\n\nSince NULL is the only character prohibited in pathnames on UNIX-oriented filesystems, let's leverage that to demonstrate the cold, hard truth – ignoring non-ignorable Windows shenanigans, which frankly bore and anger me in equal measure:\n\nBeyond sanity. Beyond pain. You will find Python portability concerns."
