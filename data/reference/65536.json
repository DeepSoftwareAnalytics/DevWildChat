        "document": "The Linux bootable USB might be not working after creation. You should know how to fix it.\n\nWrong tools or settings: During the process of creating a boot disc, if you use inappropriate tools or incorrect settings, the boot disc may not work properly. For example, if you use an incompatible version of burning software, choose the wrong writing mode, or use some tools without correctly configuring the partition scheme, file system and other parameters. or when using certain tools (e.g. Rufus, UltraISO, etc.), the partition scheme, file system and other parameters are not configured correctly.\n\nCorrupted or incomplete ISO file: If the downloaded Linux image file itself is corrupted or incomplete due to interruptions during the download process, the created boot disc will definitely not work properly. This may be due to unstable network, download source problem or storage device failure.\n\nUSB Flash Drive Quality Problems: The USB flash drive used may have quality problems itself, such as damaged memory chips, faulty main control chip, etc.. These problems may result in data not being written or read correctly, thus rendering the boot disc ineffective. You can try to replace a new USB flash drive to recreate the boot disc.\n\nIncorrect boot sequence: The boot sequence may not be configured correctly in the computer's BIOS/UEFI settings. If other devices such as hard drives, optical drives, etc. are listed before the USB stick, the computer may prioritise booting from these devices and ignore the Linux system on the USB stick. You need to enter the BIOS/UEFI setup interface and set the USB stick as the first boot item.\n\nSecure Mode Restriction: Some computers have the BIOS/UEFI set to Secure Boot mode (Secure Boot), which may prevent unauthorized operating systems from booting. If you encounter this situation, you need to temporarily disable the Secure Boot feature in the BIOS/UEFI setup, and then try to boot the Linux system from the USB stick again.\n\nPlease use the right tool to make Linux bootable USB on Windows PC as some of them are not working for the latest Linux ISO."

        "document": "Certain cases of data recovery require the use of a live USB (live CD/DVD), for instance, when the original operating system isn’t functioning and there is no possibility to transfer the affected storage to another computer. Besides data recovery, bootable drives are frequently employed for testing, diagnostics and troubleshooting, malware removal or other purposes. Such a device contains an OS installation which is ready to run directly from an external storage device instead of the computer’s internal hard drive and works entirely in the RAM without interfering with the configuration of the primary system. The environment itself is represented by an ISO file that is mounted to a USB flash drive, a portable hard disk drive connected via USB, or less commonly – burnt to a blank CD or DVD.\n\nThis article offers some guidance on how you can use third-party software to create a bootable storage medium with UFS Explorer Backup and Emergency Recovery CD – a comprehensive data recovery package which includes the Ubuntu Linux distribution with a set of preinstalled UFS Explorer and Recovery Explorer software tools. This solution makes it possible to handle almost any data loss issue without starting the host OS.\n\nCreating a bootable storage medium with an ISO image involves the use of the following elements:\n• an ISO file with a live OS (in our case – UFS Explorer Backup and Emergency Recovery CD);\n• an external storage device large enough to hold the ISO file – a USB drive is a preferred option, yet, a rewritable DVD can also be utilized;\n• specialized software that will mount the ISO file to this digital medium (Rufus and UltraISO were picked out in this instruction as examples, but you may use any other application of your choice or even the standard means of the operating system);\n• a secondary computer that will host the whole mounting process.\n\nRufus is a free open-source utility for Microsoft Windows that allows creating a bootable USB drive from an ISO file. The software is portable, thus, it doesn’t require installation and all its settings will be saved to the program’s directory.\n• Download the ISO file of UFS Explorer Backup and Emergency Recovery CD to any functioning Windows-based computer.\n• Prepare a USB stick or another flash digital medium capacious enough to place the downloaded ISO file. Plug the device into the PC. If it contains any necessary files, move them to another storage, since all the existing data on it will be permanently erased.\n• Go to the official website of Rufus and download the executable file of the software. After the download is completed, launch the application on the same computer.\n• The program will automatically detect your USB stick and display it in the \"Device\" box. If not, select this storage manually from the drop-down menu.\n• Ensure that the \"Boot selection\" is set to \"Disk or ISO image\".\n• Click \"Select\" and in the opened dialog navigate to the downloaded ISO image of UFS Explorer Backup and Emergency Recovery CD (the default file name is iso). Select the file and hit \"Open\".\n• See to it that the \"Partition scheme\" is set to \"MBR\" and the \"Target system\" – to \"BIOS (or UEFI-CSM)\". Provide any preferred name for the \"Volume label\" and press the \"Start\"\n• Rufus will begin to copy the content of the ISO file of UFS Explorer Backup and Emergency Recovery CD to the chosen USB device. When the process is finished, simply close the program. The bootable storage will be ready for use.\n\nUltraISO is one of the popular paid applications produced by EZB systems for creating, modifying and burning ISO images. The software runs under Windows and allows choosing between a regular installed and a portable version.\n• Download the ISO file of UFS Explorer Backup and Emergency Recovery CD to any operable computer running Windows.\n• Get a USB flash drive or an external USB hard drive with the capacity sufficient to locate the prepared ISO file. If there are files you need, copy them to another storage to prevent their irreversible loss.\n• Acquire the latest version of the UltraISO installer file form the official website of the software.\n• When the download is finished, open the file and follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation.\n• Launch UltraISO from the last window of the Installer or by using its desktop shortcut.\n• Click \"Continue to try\" to enter the Trial Mode or purchase the full version of the application by pressing the \"Online order\"\n• Click on \"File\" in the main menu and then choose \"Open\".\n• In the pop-up window go to the downloaded ISO image of UFS Explorer Backup and Emergency Recovery CD (the default file name is iso) and double-click the file to load it into the program.\n• Connect the prepared USB storage to the computer using a free USB port.\n• Open the \"Bootable\" menu and select \"Write Disk Image…\" to pick out the proper writing method.\n• Set the \"Write method\" option as \"USB-HDD+\". Also, ensure that the correct USB device is selected as \"Disk Drive\".\n• If required, format drive using the \"Format\" button before starting the writing process. After that, hit \"Write\" to initiate the writing procedure.\n• Click \"Yes\" to confirm the operation. Please note that any data contained on the USB drive will be overwritten.\n• UltraISO will go ahead to creating your bootable USB storage. This process may take some time, and once it is accomplished, you may close the application and use the created bootable storage.\n\nWindows 7 and later releases of this OS make it possible to burn an ISO image to a CD/DVD without any special software. However, using optical media for this purpose is usually not recommended due to their obsolescence and much lower speed.\n• Download the ISO file of UFS Explorer Backup and Emergency Recovery CD to a functioning computer running Windows 7 or later. Ensure that its drive is capable of writing to optical disks.\n• Insert a blank writable DVD disk (DVD-RW). The use of a CD is not possible in this case, as the size of the ISO file will exceed the capacity of this digital medium.\n• Open Explorer and browse to the folder where the ISO file of UFS Explorer Backup and Emergency Recovery CD was saved (the default file name is iso).\n• Right-click the ISO file and select \"Burn disk image\" in its context menu.\n• In the opened window of the Windows Disk Image Burner select your DVD disk as the \"Disk burner\" and hit \"Burn\". Close the software after the process is completed and use the created live DVD for your needs."

        "document": "Choose UEFI or legacy BIOS modes when booting into Windows PE (WinPE) or Windows Setup. After Windows is installed, if you need to switch firmware modes, you may be able to use the MBR2GPT tool.\n\nIn general, install Windows using the newer UEFI mode, as it includes more security features than the legacy BIOS mode. If you're booting from a network that only supports BIOS, you'll need to boot to legacy BIOS mode.\n\nAfter Windows is installed, the device boots automatically using the same mode it was installed with.\n\nTo boot to UEFI or BIOS:\n• None Open the firmware menus. You can use any of these methods:\n• None Boot the PC, and press the manufacturer’s key to open the menus. Common keys used: Esc, Delete, F1, F2, F10, F11, or F12. On tablets, common buttons are Volume up or Volume down (find more common keys and buttons). During startup, there’s often a screen that mentions the key. If there’s not one, or if the screen goes by too fast to see it, check your manufacturer’s site.\n• None Or, if Windows is already installed, from either the Sign on screen or the Start menu, select Power ( ) > hold Shift while selecting Restart. Select Troubleshoot > Advanced options > UEFI Firmware settings.\n• None From the firmware menus, boot to a drive or network while in UEFI or BIOS mode: On the boot device menu, select the command that identifies both the firmware mode and the device. For example, select UEFI: USB Drive or BIOS: Network/LAN. You might see separate commands for the same device. For example, you might see UEFI USB Drive and BIOS USB Drive. Each command uses the same device and media, but boots the PC in a different firmware mode. Some devices only support one mode (either UEFI or BIOS). Other devices will only allow you to boot to BIOS mode by manually disabling the UEFI security features. To disable the security features, go to Security > Secure Boot and disable the feature. Some older PCs (Windows 7-era or earlier) support UEFI, but require you to browse to the boot file. From the firmware menus, look for the option: \"Boot from file\", then browse to \\EFI\\BOOT\\BOOTX64.EFI on Windows PE or Windows Setup media.\n\nDetect if WinPE is booted into BIOS or UEFI Mode\n\nQuery the registry to determine which mode the device is in. You can do this from the command line:\n\nUse it in a script:\n\nNote that between and is a tab, followed by a space.\n\nMake sure you boot into the right mode every time\n\nHere are a couple of ways you can make sure you're booted into the right firmware mode every time you start your PC.\n\nUse preformatted hard drives, and use a method that doesn't automatically format the drive.\n\nIf you want to ensure that your drive boots into a certain mode, use drives that you've preformatted with the GPT file format for UEFI mode, or the MBR file format for BIOS mode. When the installation starts, if the PC is booted to the wrong mode, Windows installation will fail. To fix this, restart the PC in the correct firmware mode.\n\nIf you want a PC to only boot into a certain mode, you can remove the files that Windows PE or Windows Setup use to boot in UEFI or BIOS mode. Remove the following files, depending on the mode you want to boot to.\n\nBoot only when in UEFI mode\n\nRemove the bootmgr file from the root of the Windows PE or Windows Setup media. This prevents the device from starting in BIOS mode.\n\nBoot only when in BIOS mode\n\nRemove the efi folder from the root of the Windows PE or Windows Setup media.

        "document": "When preparing to install a fresh copy of Windows 10, you typically use a USB flash drive to launch the \"Windows Setup\" wizard to continue with the process. However, on a device that has a Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) instead of the legacy Basic Input/Output System (BIOS), it is crucial to use the correct media for the firmware type to start and complete the installation successfully.\n\nOn Windows 10, you can use at least two tools to create a bootable USB flash drive. You can use the Microsoft Media Creation Tool to download the files onto a removable drive with support for both firmware types (UEFI and legacy BIOS). You can also use Rufus, a third-party tool that makes creating a flash drive installer easy with support for UEFI.\n\nIn this how-to guide, I will walk you through creating a Windows 10 USB flash drive with support for UEFI using the Microsoft Media Creation Tool and Rufus.\n\nHow to create Windows 10 UEFI boot media with Media Creation Tool\n\nThe Media Creation Tool is the best option for creating a bootable USB media for performing an in-place upgrade or clean installation of Windows 10.\n\nTo create a Windows 10 USB media, connect a flash drive of at least 8GB of space, and then use these steps:\n• Click the Download now button to save the file under the \"Create Windows 10 installation media\" section.\n• Double-click the MediaCreationToolxxxx.exe file to launch the setup.\n• Click the Accept button to agree to the licensing terms.\n• Select the \"Create installation media (USB flash drive, DVD, or ISO file) for another PC\" option.\n• (Optional) Clear the \"Use the recommended options for this PC\" option.\n• Select the correct language, architecture, and edition of Windows 10 (if applicable).\n• Quick tip: If you plan to install Windows on multiple computers running 32-bit and 64-bit architectures, use the \"Architecture\" drop-down menu and select the \"Both\" option to create a media that will work on both systems.\n• Select the flash drive from the list. (If you do not see the device, click the \"Refresh drive list\" option.)\n\nOnce you complete the steps, the Media Creation Tool will download the files and will create a bootable USB flash drive that you can use to install Windows 10 on computers with support for UEFI and BIOS.\n\nHow to create Windows 10 UEFI boot media with Rufus\n\nIf the Media Creation Tool does not work or you do not want to use it, you can try Rufus, a popular free third-party tool that allows you to create installation media with support for UEFI devices. The utility offers two ways to create the installation media, including using an existing ISO file or downloading the image from the Microsoft servers directly from the app.\n\nTo create a USB media with an existing Windows 10 ISO file, connect a flash drive of at least 8GB of space and use these steps:\n• Click the latest release (first link) and save the file under the \"Download\" section.\n• Double-click the Rufus-x.xx.exe file to launch the tool.\n• Under the \"Device\" section, select the USB flash drive.\n• Under the \"Boot selection\" section, click the Select button on the right.\n• Select the Windows 10 ISO file from the folder location.\n• Use the \"Image option\" drop-down menu and select the \"Standard Windows installation\" option.\n• Use the \"Partition scheme\" drop-down menu and select the GPT option.\n• Use the \"Target system\" drop-down menu and select the UEFI (non CSM) option.\n• Continue with the default settings under the \"Show Advanced drive properties\" section (as necessary).\n• Confirm a name for the drive (for example, \"Windows 10 USB\") under the \"Volume label\" setting.\n• Do not change the default settings in the \"File system\" and \"Cluster size\" options.\n• Clear the available settings in the \"Windows User Experience\" page.\n• Click the OK button to confirm.\n\nAfter you complete the steps, Rufus will create a USB flash drive to install Windows 10 on a device using UEFI.\n\nThe tool also has a feature to download the Windows 10 ISO file, which you can then use to create a USB flash drive to install Windows 10.\n\nTo create an install media with UEFI support with Rufus, use these steps:\n• Click the latest release (first link) of the tool to save the file under the \"Download\" section.\n• Double-click the Rufus-x.xx.exe file to launch the tool.\n• Click the Settings button at the bottom of the page.\n• Choose the \"Check for updates\" drop-down menu and select the Daily option under the \"Settings\" section.\n• Double-click the Rufus-x.xx.exe file to reopen the utility.\n• Select the USB flash drive from the list under the \"Device\" section.\n• Click the arrow button next to the \"Select\" option and choose the Download option.\n• Use the \"Version\" drop-down menu and select the Windows 10 option.\n• Select the 22H2 (Build 19045.xxx - xxxx.xx) option to download the latest version of Windows 10.\n• Select the Windows 10 Home/Pro/Edu option from the \"Edition\" menu.\n• Choose the installation language in the \"Language\" menu.\n• Quick note: If you are in the United States, select the \"English\" option. Otherwise, select the \"English International\" option or the language that applies to you.\n• Select the 32-bit or 64-bit option (recommended) in the \"Architecture\" menu.\n• Quick tip: You can check your computer's architecture on Settings > System > About, and under the \"Device specifications\" section, confirm whether the \"System type\" is 64-bit or 32-bit.\n• Use the \"Image option\" drop-down menu and select the \"Standard Windows installation\" option.\n• Use the \"Partition scheme\" drop-down menu and select the GPT option.\n• Use the \"Target system\" drop-down menu and select the UEFI (non CSM) option.\n• Continue with the default settings under the \"Show Advanced drive properties\" section (as necessary).\n• Confirm a name for the drive (for example, \"Windows 10 USB\") under the \"Volume label\" setting.\n• Do not change the default settings under the \"File system\" and \"Cluster size\" sections.\n• Clear the available settings on the \"Windows User Experience\" page.\n\nOnce you complete the steps, Rufus will run the automated script to download the Windows 10 ISO file from the Microsoft servers and create a bootable media to install the operating system on a UEFI device without needing the Media Creation Tool.\n\nWhen you have the USB boot media with support for UEFI systems, you can launch the \"Windows Setup\" wizard to perform a clean installation of Windows 10 or an in-place upgrade.\n\nFor more helpful articles, coverage, and answers to common questions about Windows 10, visit the following resources:\n• Windows 11 on Windows Central — All you need to know\n• Windows 10 on Windows Central — All you need to know"
