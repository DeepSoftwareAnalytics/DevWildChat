        "document": "While creating a process, the operating system performs several operations. To identify the processes, it assigns a process identification number (PID) to each process. As the operating system supports multi-programming, it needs to keep track of all the processes. For this task, the process control block (PCB) is used to track the process’s execution status. Each block of memory contains information about the process state, program counter, stack pointer, status of opened files, scheduling algorithms, etc.\n\nAll this information is required and must be saved when the process is switched from one state to another. When the process makes a transition from one state to another, the operating system must update information in the process’s PCB. A Process Control Block (PCB) contains information about the process, i.e. registers, quantum, priority, etc. The Process Table is an array of PCBs, which logically contains a PCB for all of the current processes in the system.\n\nA Process Control Block (PCB) is a data structure used by the operating system to manage information about a process. The process control keeps track of many important pieces of information needed to manage processes efficiently. The diagram helps explain some of these key data items.\n• Pointer: It is a stack pointer that is required to be saved when the process is switched from one state to another to retain the current position of the process.\n• Process state: It stores the respective state of the process.\n• Process number: Every process is assigned a unique id known as process ID or PID which stores the process identifier.\n• Program counter: stores the counter, which contains the address of the next instruction that is to be executed for the process.\n• Register: in the PCB, it is a data structure. When a processes is running and it’s time slice expires, the current value of process specific registers would be stored in the PCB and the process would be swapped out. When the process is scheduled to be run, the register values is read from the PCB and written to the CPU registers. This is the main purpose of the registers in the PCB.\n• Memory limits: This field contains the information about used by the operating system. This may include page tables, segment tables, etc.\n• List of Open files: This information includes the list of files opened for a process.\n\nAdditional Points to Consider for Process Control Block (PCB)\n• Interrupt Handling: The PCB also contains information about the interrupts that a process may have generated and how they were handled by the operating system.\n• Context Switching: The process of switching from one process to another is called context switching. The PCB plays a crucial role in context switching by saving the state of the current process and restoring the state of the next process.\n• Real-Time Systems: Real-time operating systems may require additional information in the PCB, such as deadlines and priorities, to ensure that time-critical processes are executed in a timely manner.\n• Virtual Memory Management: The PCB may contain information about a process management, such as page tables and page fault handling.\n• Fault Tolerance: Some operating systems may use multiple copies of the PCB to provide fault tolerance in case of hardware failures or software errors.\n\nThe Process Control Block (PCB) is stored in a special part of memory that normal users can’t access. This is because it holds important information about the process. Some operating systems place the PCB at the start of the kernel stack for the process, as this is a safe and secure spot.\n• Keeps Track of Processes: It helps the operating system know which processes are running, waiting, or completed.\n• Helps in Scheduling: The process table provides information needed to decide which process should run next.\n• Easy Process Management: It organizes all the details about processes in one place, making it simple for the OS to manage them.\n• Stores Process Details: PCB keeps all the important information about a process, like its state, ID, and resources it uses.\n• Helps Resume Processes: When a process is paused, PCB saves its current state so it can continue later without losing data.\n• Ensures Smooth Execution: By storing all the necessary details, PCB helps the operating system run processes efficiently and without interruptions.\n• Takes Up Memory : The process table needs space to store information about all processes, which can use a lot of memory in systems with many processes.\n• Slower Operations : When there are too many processes, searching or updating the table can take more time, slowing down the system.\n• Extra Work for the System : The operating system has to constantly update the process table, which adds extra work and can reduce overall system performance.\n• Uses More Memory : Each process needs its own PCB, so having many processes can consume a lot of memory.\n• Slows Context Switching , the system has to update the PCB of the old process and load the PCB of the new one, which takes time and affects performance.\n• Security Risks : If the PCB is not well-protected, someone could access or modify it, causing security problems for processes.\n\nThe Process Table and PCB are important for managing processes in an operating system. The Process Table keeps a list of all active processes, and the PCB holds details about each process. The PCB enables smooth process switching, effective multitasking, and efficient resource allocation.

A process control block (PCB) contains information about the process, i.e. registers, quantum, priority, etc. The process table is an array of PCBs, which logically contains a PCB for all of the current processes in the system. In this article, we will discuss every point about the Process Control Block.\n\nA Process Control Block (PCB) is a data structure that is used by an Operating System to manage and regulate how processes are carried out. In operating systems, managing the process and scheduling them properly play the most significant role in the efficient usage of memory and other system resources. In the process control block, all the details regarding the process corresponding to it like its current status, its program counter, its memory use, its open files, and details about CPU scheduling are stored.\n\nWith the creation of a process, a PCB is created which controls how that process is being carried out. The PCB is created with the aim of helping the OS to manage the enormous amounts of tasks that are being carried out in the system. PCB is helpful in doing that as it helps the OS to actively monitor the process and redirect system resources to each process accordingly. The OS creates a PCB for every process which is created, and it contains all the important information about the process. All this information is afterward used by the OS to manage processes and run them efficiently.\n• Process State: The state of the process is stored in the PCB which helps to manage the processes and schedule them. There are different states for a process which are “running,” “waiting,” “ready,” or “terminated.”\n• Process ID: The OS assigns a unique identifier to every process as soon as it is created which is known as Process ID, this helps to distinguish between processes.\n• Program Counter: While running processes when the context switch occurs the last instruction to be executed is stored in the r which helps in resuming the execution of the process from where it left off.\n• CPU Registers: of the process helps to restore the state of the process so the PCB stores a copy of them.\n• Memory Information: The information like the base address or total memory allocated to a process is stored in PCB which helps in efficient memory allocation to the processes.\n• Process Scheduling Information: The priority of the processes or the algorithm of scheduling is stored in the PCB to help in making scheduling decisions of the OS.\n• Accounting Information: The information such as CPU time, memory usage, etc helps the OS to monitor the performance of the process.\n• Process Scheduling: The different information like Process priority, process state, and resources used can be used by the OS to schedule the process on the execution stack. The scheduler checks the priority and other information to set when the process will be executed.\n• Multitasking: Resource allocation, process scheduling, and process synchronization altogether helps the OS to multitask and run different processes simultaneously.\n• Context Switching: When context switching happens in the OS the process state is saved in the CPU register and a copy of it is stored in the PCB. When the CPU switches to another process and then switches back to that process the CPU fetches that value from the PCB and restores the previous state of the process.\n• Resources Sharing: The PCB stores information like the resources that a process is using, such as files open and memory allocated. This information helps the OS to let a new process use the resources which are being used by any other process to execute sharing of the resources.\n\nPoints to Consider for Process Control Block (PCB)\n\nThe Process Control Block (PCB) is stored in a special part of memory that normal users can’t access. This is because it holds important information about the process. Some operating systems place the PCB at the start of the kernel stack for the process, as this is a safe and secure spot.\n• None As, PCB stores all the information about the process so it lets the operating system execute different tasks like process scheduling, context switching, etc.\n• None Using PCB helps in scheduling the processes and it ensures that the CPU resources are allocated efficiently.\n• None When the different resource utilization information about a process are used from the PCB they help in efficient resource utilization and resource sharing.\n• None The CPU registers and stack pointers information helps the OS to save the process state which helps in Context switching.\n• The process table and PCB can be used to processes in an operating system. The PCB contains information about each process’s synchronization state, such as its waiting status and the resources it is waiting for.\n• None The process table and PCB can be used to schedule processes for execution. By keeping track of each process’s state and resource usage, the operating system can determine which processes should be executed next.\n• None To store the PCB for each and every process there is a significant usage of the memory in there can be a large number of processes available simultaneously in the OS. So using PCB adds extra memory usage.\n• None Using PCB reduces the scalability of the process in the OS as the whole process of using the PCB adds some complexity to the user so it makes it tougher to scale the system further.\n• None The process table and PCB can introduce overhead and reduce system performance. The operating system must maintain the process table and PCB for each process, which can consume system resources.\n• None The process table and PCB can increase system complexity and make it more challenging to develop and maintain operating systems. The need to manage and synchronize multiple processes can make it more difficult to design and implement system features and ensure system stability\n\nThe Process Control Block (PCB) is essential for managing processes in an operating system. It stores crucial data about each process, like its unique ID, current state, and resource usage. The PCB enables smooth process switching, effective multitasking, and efficient resource allocation.

        "document": "A process control block (PCB), also sometimes called a process descriptor, is a data structure used by a computer operating system to store all the information about a process.\n\nWhen a process is created (initialized or installed), the operating system creates a corresponding process control block, which specifies and tracks the process state (i.e. new, ready, running, waiting or terminated). Since it is used to track process information, the PCB plays a key role in context switching.[1]\n\nThe current working directory of a process is one of the properties that the kernel stores in the process's PCB.[3]\n\nThe role of the PCBs is central in process management: they are accessed and/or modified by most utilities, particularly those involved with scheduling and resource management.\n\nIn multitasking operating systems, the PCB stores data needed for correct and efficient process management.[4] Though the details of these structures are system-dependent, common elements fall in three main categories:\n\nStatus tables exist for each relevant entity, like describing memory, I/O devices, files and processes.\n\nMemory tables, for example, contain information about the allocation of main and secondary (virtual) memory for each process, authorization attributes for accessing memory areas shared among different processes, etc. I/O tables may have entries stating the availability of a device or its assignment to a process, the status of I/O operations, the location of memory buffers used for them, etc.\n\nProcess identification data include a unique identifier for the process (almost invariably an integer) and, in a multiuser-multitasking system, data such as the identifier of the parent process, user identifier, user group identifier, etc. The process id is particularly relevant since it is often used to cross-reference the tables defined above, e.g. showing which process is using which I/O devices, or memory areas.\n\nProcess state data define the status of a process when it is suspended, allowing the OS to restart it later. This always includes the content of general-purpose CPU registers, the CPU process status word, stack and frame pointers, etc. During context switch, the running process is stopped and another process runs. The kernel must stop the execution of the running process, copy out the values in hardware registers to its PCB, and update the hardware registers with the values from the PCB of the new process.\n\nProcess control information is used by the OS to manage the process itself. This includes:\n• Process scheduling state – The state of the process in terms of \"ready\", \"suspended\", etc., and other scheduling information as well, such as priority value, the amount of time elapsed since the process gained control of the CPU or since it was suspended. Also, in case of a suspended process, event identification data must be recorded for the event the process is waiting for;\n• Process structuring information – the process's children id's, or the id's of other processes related to the current one in some functional way, which may be represented as a queue, a ring or other data structures;\n• Interprocess communication information – flags, signals and messages associated with the communication among independent processes;\n• Process Number (PID) – unique identification number for each process (also known as Process ID);\n• Program Counter (PC) – a pointer to the address of the next instruction to be executed for this process;\n• CPU Registers – register set where process needs to be stored for execution for running state;\n• Accounting Information – amount of CPU used for process execution, time limits, execution ID etc.;\n• I/O Status Information – list of I/O devices allocated to the process.\n\nPCB must be kept in an area of memory protected from normal process access. In some operating systems the PCB is placed at the bottom of the process stack.[5]"

        "document": "Banker’s Algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm used in operating systems. It ensures that a system remains in a safe state by carefully allocating resources to processes while avoiding unsafe states that could lead to deadlocks.\n• None The Banker’s Algorithm is a smart way for computer systems to manage how programs use resources, like memory or CPU time.\n• None It helps prevent situations where programs get stuck and can not finish their tasks. This condition is known as deadlock.\n• None By keeping track of what resources each program needs and what’s available, the banker algorithm makes sure that programs only get what they need in a safe order.\n\nWhy Banker’s Algorithm is Named So?\n\nThe banker’s algorithm is named so because it is used in the banking system to check whether a loan can be sanctioned to a person or not. Suppose there are n number of account holders in a bank and the total sum of their money is S. Let us assume that the bank has a certain amount of money Y. If a person applies for a loan then the bank first subtracts the loan amount from the total money that the bank has (Y) and if the remaining amount is greater than S then only the loan is sanctioned. It is done because if all the account holders come to withdraw their money then the bank can easily do it.\n\nIt also helps the OS to successfully share the resources between all the processes. The banker’s algorithm uses the notation of a safe allocation state to ensure that granting a resource request cannot lead to a deadlock either immediately or in the future. In other words, the bank would never allocate its money in such a way that it can no longer satisfy the needs of all its customers. The bank would try to be in a safe state always.\n\nThe following Data structures are used to implement the Banker’s Algorithm:\n\nLet ‘n’ be the number of processes in the system and ‘m’ be the number of resource types.\n• None It is a 1-D array of size ‘m’ indicating the number of available resources of each type.\n• None Available[ j ] = k means there are ‘k’ R\n• None It is a 2-d array of size ‘ n*m’ that defines the maximum demand of each process in a system.\n• P may request at most ‘k’ R\n• None It is a 2-d array of size ‘n*m’ that defines the number of resources of each type currently allocated to each process.\n• None It is a 2-d array of size ‘n*m’ that indicates the remaining resource need of each process.\n\nAllocation specifies the resources currently allocated to process P and Need specifies the additional resources that process P may still request to complete its task.\n\nThe algorithm for finding out whether or not a system is in a safe state can be described as follows:\n\nLet Request be the request array for process P . Request [j] = k means process P wants k instances of resource type R . When a request for resources is made by process P , the following actions are taken:\n\nExample: Considering a system with five processes P through P and three resources of type A, B, C. Resource type A has 10 instances, B has 5 instances and type C has 7 instances. Suppose at time t following snapshot of the system has been taken:\n\nQ.1 What will be the content of the Need matrix?\n\nNeed [i, j] = Max [i, j] – Allocation [i, j]\n\nSo, the content of Need Matrix is:\n\nQ.2 Is the system in a safe state? If Yes, then what is the safe sequence?\n\nApplying the Safety algorithm on the given system,\n\nQ.3 What will happen if process P1 requests one additional instance of resource type A and two instances of resource type C?\n\nWe must determine whether this new system state is safe. To do so, we again execute Safety algorithm on the above data structures.\n\nHence the new system state is safe, so we can immediately grant the request for process P\n\nIn the context of the Banker’s Algorithm, an unsafe state refers to a situation in which, all processes in a system currently hold resources within their maximum needs, there is no guarantee that the system can avoid a deadlock in the future. This state is contrasted with a safe state, where there exists a sequence of resource allocation and deallocation that guarantees that all processes can complete without leading to a deadlock.\n• Safe State: There exists at least one sequence of processes such that each process can obtain the needed resources, complete its execution, release its resources, and thus allow other processes to eventually complete without entering a deadlock.\n• Unsafe State: Even though the system can still allocate resources to some processes, there is no guarantee that all processes can finish without potentially causing a deadlock.\n\nConsider a system with three processes ( , , ) and 6 instances of a resource. Let’s say:\n• None The available instances of the resource are: 1\n• None The current allocation of resources to processes is:\n• None The maximum demand (maximum resources each process may eventually request) is:\n• None may need 2 more resources to complete.\n• None may need 2 more resource to complete.\n• None may need 2 more resources to complete.\n\nHowever, there is only 1 resource available. Even though none of the processes are currently deadlocked, the system is in an unsafe state because there is no sequence of resource allocation that guarantees all processes can complete.\n\nWhy is the Banker’s Algorithm important?\n\nHow does the Banker’s Algorithm work?\n\nCan the Banker’s Algorithm prevent all deadlock situations?\n\nWhat is the safe sequence in OS?"

Banker’s algorithm consist of Safety algorithm and Resource request algorithm Safety Algorithm\n\nThe algorithm for finding out whether or not a system is in a safe state can be described as follows:\n\nSafe sequence is the sequence in which the processes can be safely executed. A state is safe if the system can allocate resources to each process (up to its maximum) in some order and still avoid a deadlock. More formally, ” a system is in a safe state only if there exists a safe sequence” .If a system has a safe sequence, it implies that there is no deadlock present. The sequence guarantees that all processes will complete their execution without getting into a circular wait situation. It is possible to have multiple safe sequences in a system. This occurs when there are multiple ways to order the execution of processes such that no deadlock will occur. Each safe sequence represents a different order in which processes can be executed while avoiding deadlocks. The existance of multiple safe sequences allows the system to have flexibility in scheduling processes and allocating resources. Different scheduling algorithms or resource allocation can depend on factors such as system efficiency, resource utilization, fairness or other criteria that the operating system aims to optimize.\n\nIn this post, implementation of Safety algorithm of Banker’s Algorithm is done.\n\n// Function to find the need of each process // Calculating Need of each P // Function to find the system is in safe state or not // While all processes are not finished // or system is not in safe state. // Find a process which is not finish and // whose needs can be satisfied with current // First check if a process is finished, // if no, go for next condition // Check if for all resources of // current P need is less // If all needs of p were satisfied. // If we could not find a next process in safe \"System is not in safe state\" // If system is in safe state then // safe sequence will be as below // Maximum R that can be allocated // Check system is in safe state or not // Function to find the need of each process // Calculating Need of each P // Function to find the system is in safe state or not // While all processes are not finished // or system is not in safe state. // Find a process which is not finish and // whose needs can be satisfied with current // First check if a process is finished, // if no, go for next condition // Check if for all resources of // current P need is less // If all needs of p were satisfied. // If we could not find a next process in safe \"System is not in safe state\" // If system is in safe state then // safe sequence will be as below // Maximum R that can be allocated // Check system is in safe state or not // This code has been contributed by 29AjayKumar # Function to find the need of each process # Calculating Need of each P # Function to find the system is in # While all processes are not finished # or system is not in safe state. # Find a process which is not finish # and whose needs can be satisfied # First check if a process is finished, # if no, go for next condition # Check if for all resources # of current P need is less # If all needs of p were satisfied. # If we could not find a next process \"System is not in safe state\" # If system is in safe state then # safe sequence will be as below # Maximum R that can be allocated # Check system is in safe state or not # This code is contributed by // Function to find the need of each process // Calculating Need of each P // Function to find the system is in safe state or not // While all processes are not finished // or system is not in safe state. // Find a process which is not finish and // whose needs can be satisfied with current // First check if a process is finished, // if no, go for next condition // Check if for all resources of // current P need is less // If all needs of p were satisfied. // If we could not find a next process in safe \"System is not in safe state\" // If system is in safe state then // safe sequence will be as below // Maximum R that can be allocated // Check system is in safe state or not // This code has been contributed by ajit. // Function to find the need of each process // Calculating Need of each P // Function to find the system is in safe state or not // While all processes are not finished // or system is not in safe state. // Find a process which is not finish and // whose needs can be satisfied with current // First check if a process is finished, // if no, go for next condition // Check if for all resources of // current P need is less // If all needs of p were satisfied. // If we could not find a next process in safe \"System is not in safe state\" // If system is in safe state then // safe sequence will be as below \"System is in safe state.\n\nSafe sequence is: \" // Maximum R that can be allocated to processes // Check system is in safe state or not // This code is contributed by ishankhandelwals.\n\nIllustration : Considering a system with five processes P0 through P4 and three resources types A, B, C.

In this article, we will explore this algorithm in depth in C language.\n\nThe banker’s algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm. It is used in operating systems to manage the allocation of resources to multiple designs to ensure that a system can avoid entering a deadlocked state. This algorithm was developed by Edsger Dijkstra.\n\nLet’s understand how a banker’s algorithm works. Suppose there are five processes, P0, P1, P2, P3, and P4, with resources A, B, and C allocated to each process. We have their maximum need, and we need to use the Banker’s algorithm to find the remaining need and get a sequence of processes that is in a safe state. The following table describes the Banker’s Algorithm:\n\n#include <stdio.h> #include <stdbool.h> #define N 5 // Number of processes #define M 3 // Number of resources void calculateNeed(int need[N][M], int max[N][M], int alloc[N][M]) { for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) { for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) { need[i][j] = max[i][j] - alloc[i][j]; } } } bool isSafe(int processes[], int avail[], int max[][M], int alloc[][M]) { int need[N][M]; calculateNeed(need, max, alloc); bool finish[N] = {false}; int safeSeq[N]; int work[M]; for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) work[i] = avail[i]; int count = 0; while (count < N) { bool found = false; for (int p = 0; p < N; p++) { if (finish[p] == false) { int j; for (j = 0; j < M; j++) if (need[p][j] > work[j]) break; if (j == M) { for (int k = 0; k < M; k++) work[k] += alloc[p][k]; safeSeq[count++] = p; finish[p] = true; found = true; } } } if (found == false) { printf(\"The system is not in a safe staten\"); return false; } } printf(\"The system is in a safe state.nSafe sequence is: \"); for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) printf(\"%d \", safeSeq[i]); printf(\"n\"); return true; } int main() { int processes[] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}; int avail[] = {3, 3, 2}; int max[N][M] = { {7, 5, 3}, {3, 2, 2}, {9, 0, 2}, {2, 2, 2}, {4, 3, 3} }; int alloc[N][M] = { {0, 1, 0}, {2, 0, 0}, {3, 0, 2}, {2, 1, 1}, {0, 0, 2} }; isSafe(processes, avail, max, alloc); return 0; }\n\nIn this section, we will see the advantages of the banker’s algorithm. This algorithm helps in avoiding deadlocks by ensuring that resource allocation always leaves the system in a safe state. It maximises resource utilisation by allocating resources in a way that guarantees system safety This ensures all processes get their required resources eventually, provided the system is in a safe state. This is ideal for a system where the resources and processes are fixed and known in advance\n\nIn this article, we learned about the Banker’s Algorithm in C language. It is essential to understand advanced concepts in operating system design. This algorithm is particularly useful in managing resource allocation and preventing deadlock scenarios. It stands out for its ability to ensure system safety by carefully managing resource requests based on current allocation, maximum demands, and available resources. The Banker’s Algorithm remains foundational for developers and system architects, offering invaluable insights into optimising resource utilisation and maintaining system stability in operating systems.\n\nWhy is the Banker’s Algorithm important? The banker’s algorithm is crucial for preventing deadlock in operating systems. Deadlock occurs when processes are unable to proceed because each process is waiting for resources held by another process. The Banker’s algorithm helps maintain system stability and optimal resource utilisation by ensuring that resource allocation leads to a safe state. What are the advantages of using the Banker’s Algorithm? There are many advantages of Banker’s algorithm such as deadlock avoidance, optimal resource utilisation, preemptive resource allocation, and system stability maintenance. It ensures fairness in resource allocation and prevents the system from entering an unsafe state. What is the real-life application of the Bankers algorithm?

It is the preemptive version of the First come First Serve CPU Scheduling algorithm.\n\nThis article focuses on implementing a Round Robin Scheduling Program where all processes have the same arrival time. In this scenario, all processes arrive at the same time which makes scheduling easier. You can focus on the main logic of dividing CPU time equally and managing the process queue.\n\nCharacteristics of Round Robin CPU Scheduling Algorithm with Same Arrival Time\n\nBelow are the key characteristics of the Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm when all processes share the same arrival time:\n• Equal Time Allocation: Each process gets an equal and fixed time slice (time quantum) to execute, ensuring fairness.\n• Cyclic Execution: Processes are scheduled in a circular order, and the CPU moves to the next process in the queue after completing the time quantum.\n• No Process Starvation: All processes are guaranteed CPU time at regular intervals, preventing any process from being neglected.\n• Same Start Time: Since all processes arrive at the same time, there is no need to consider arrival time while scheduling, simplifying the process.\n• Context Switching: Frequent context switching occurs as the CPU moves between processes after each time quantum, which can slightly impact performance.\n\nExample of Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm for the Same Arrival Time\n\nHow to Compute Below Times in Round Robin Using a Program?\n• Completion Time: Time at which process completes its execution.\n• Waiting Time(W.T): Time Difference between turn around time and burst time. \n\nWaiting Time = Turn Around Time – Burst Time\n\nProgram for Round Robin Scheduling with Arrival Time as 0 for all Processes\n\nSteps to find waiting times of all processes\n\nOnce we have waiting times, we can compute turn around time tat[i] of a process as sum of waiting and burst times, i.e., wt[i] + bt[i].\n\nBelow is implementation of above steps.\n\n// C++ program for implementation of RR scheduling // Function to find the waiting time for all // until all of them are not done. // Traverse all processes one by one repeatedly // If burst time of a process is greater than 0 // then only need to process further // Increase the value of t i.e. shows // how much time a process has been processed // If burst time is smaller than or equal to // quantum.

It is simple to implement but can lead to higher context-switching overhead. While it promotes fairness and prevents starvation, it may result in longer waiting times and reduced throughput, depending on the time quantum. Effective program implementation allows for the calculation of key metrics like completion time, turnaround time, and waiting time, aiding in performance evaluation and optimization.\n\nProgram for Round Robin Scheduling for the Same Arrival Time – FAQs\n\nRound Robin assigns each process with a fixed time quantum during which it can execute on the CPU. Once the time quantum expires, the next process in line is allocated the CPU for its turn. No process can run for more than one quantum while others are waiting in the ready queue. If a process needs more CPU time to complete after exhausting one quantum, it goes to the end of ready queue to await the next allocation. This cyclical distribution ensures that each process gets an equal opportunity to utilize the CPU.\n\nWhat are the advantages of round robin scheduling algorithm?"

        "document": "In our previous articles, we learned about First Come First Serve based CPU scheduling where the CPU scheduling algorithm scheduled the processes on the basis of the arrival time which is the process in which requests for the resources first are allocated likewise. Round Robin Scheduling is generally a primitive version of what we learned in First Come First Serve based CPU scheduling. In Round Robin Scheduling, the processes run for a specific time period(called quantum) and successive processes wait for their turn to execute.\n\nIntroduction to Round Robin Scheduling in C Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm is a scheduling algorithm for time-sharing systems. It is preemptive in nature that it switches between processes according to the time allotted for each process. The time slice that is used to switch between the processes is known as Quantum. Round Robin scheduling is cyclic in nature and is also known as Time Slicing Scheduling.\n\nWe will now work on a Round Robin scheduling program in C. Let us consider 4 processes P1, P2, P3, and P4 with CPU time as 3, 5, 2, and 4 with a time quantum of 1 unit. The Gantt chart is prepared as follows: The waiting time for processes are The waiting time is calculated as the total waiting time till a process reaches a time of completion. Hence, we calculated the waiting time for all the processes P1, P2, P3 and P4 from its Gantt chart and then found the average waiting time by calculating the mean waiting time for all the processes.\n\nExample of Round Robin Scheduling in C Arrival time is the time at which the process arrives in the ready queue. Burst time is the time required by a process for its execution. Waiting time is the total time taken for the complete execution of the process. Turaround time is the total time for which the process exists in the system. Hence, here since the arrival time and burst time for each process are given, we calculate the turnaround time and waiting time. tat=ct- at and wt= tat-bt and accordingly calculate the average waiting time and average turnaround time.\n\nHere in the Round Robin Scheduling program in C, we organized all the processes according to their arrival time in the Ready queue. Then we pushed the first process from ready queue to be executed for the first time. The CPU saves the previous state of the process inorder to resume from the point where it was earlier interrupted. In a similar manner, another process is selected from the ready queue for the task to get executed and the same steps are continued till all the processes reach completion.\n\nProgram for Round Robin Scheduling with Different Arrival Times for All Processes In the above Round Robin Scheduling program in C, we first took the process that occurred first and start executing the process considering the time quantum. Then we check for any other process request. If there's a process request amidst the time quantum in which another process is being executed then add the new process to the ready queue. Once, the quantum time passes, we check for any other process in the ready queue. If the queue turns empty and the current process remains incomplete, then we add the current process to the ready queue. We then take the first process from the ready queue and execute it. Finally, when the process gets completed and the ready queue is empty, the task is said to be complete. Hence, we find the Average waiting time and Average turnaround time as we did previously."

It is a CPU scheduling algorithm used in operating systems to ensure that no single process monopolises the CPU. Assigning a single time slice or quantum to each task ensures that all tasks get their time executed.\n\nPicture yourself waiting in line for a popular ride at a carnival. You stand until it’s your turn, enjoy the ride for a designated time, and then step off to make room for the next person. If you want to ride again, you’ll need to go to the back of the line and wait for your turn to come around once more.\n\nWhat is Round Robin Scheduling in C\n\nRound Robin (RR) scheduling is one of the most widely used CPU scheduling algorithms developed to allocate CPU time to each process in a round-robin way. Round Robin scheduling is cyclic in nature and is also known as Time Slicing Scheduling. Each process is allotted a fixed time slice or quantum. If the process does not finish the execution of its work within the time assigned, it is placed at the end of the ready queue, and the CPU scheduler will pick up the next process. In this way, every process is treated more or less fairly; all processes will be given equal amounts of CPU time in a round-robin manner.\n\nHere are the characteristics of round robin scheduling:\n• Each task is assigned a fixed time quantum to execute. The time quantum decides how long a process executes before being sent to the back of the queue.\n• If the time quantum is small, it ensures better responsiveness but increases the overhead (cost, time, or resources) due to constant switching.\n• If the time quantum is large, it might decrease responsiveness.\n• Each task gets the same time to execute before being moved to the back of the line.\n• It ensures that no task dominates.\n• It interrupts a task after completion of its time quantum even if the task isn’t completed.\n• This increases responsiveness, especially in a system with multiple interactive users.\n• It is suitable for time-sharing systems where response time is crucial.\n\nFCFS stands for the First Come First Serve method for CPU scheduling; it runs processes in the order in which they come to the queue. The process that arrives first gets executed first, and the process that arrives next will have to wait, and so on. One of the simplest CPU scheduling algorithms, FCFS scheduling generally consists of a FIFO (First In First Out) queue.\n\nHere are the characteristics of FCFS scheduling:\n• Non-Preemptive: Once its execution starts, a process cannot be preempted by another process. A process can finish only after it has run till completion.\n• Arrival Time Based: PCs consider arrival time in the ready queue when selecting processes.\n• FIFO Queue: Processes are executed in the order they arrive; the process that comes first will be allocated CPU first.\n• Fairness: All processes get a fair chance for execution; however, longer processes may cause waiting time to short ones.\n• High Wait Time: The CPU is busy executing longer jobs first; therefore, the shorter processes may have to wait quite a bit.\n• Not Preemptive: This algorithm does not preempt a running process for another even if there is one waiting for execution, which makes it appropriate for such environments where no interruption occurs.\n\nAdvantages of Round Robin Scheduling in C\n\nThe C language is widely recognized as a versatile programming language, offering a host of advantages for various applications. One notable implementation is the Round Robin scheduling algorithm, which is used in operating systems to manage processes efficiently. Here are some key advantages of using Round Robin in C:\n• Due to its low-level nature, C makes it possible to interact directly with the computer hardware and system resources. This control ensures better optimization of the scheduling algorithm.\n• C is a compiled language, meaning it generates highly efficient machine code. This efficiency makes it easier to run tasks faster without utilizing many resources.\n• Linux and Unix are written in C. Since the Round Robin program works closely with the OS, it is easier to implement it in real-world systems.\n• Regular context switching happens in Round Robin Scheduling when tasks are not completed. They are sent to the back of the queue while the next task is executed. This is handled very well in C.\n• C is one of the first languages students learn; executing the Round Robin program in C gives them a better understanding of how CPU works and how an algorithm is converted to code.\n• Debugging becomes relatively easy when executed with C.\n\nRound Robin CPU Scheduling algorithm allocates a fixed amount of processing time to a job before it is forced to wait its turn again. Each process gets a chance to execute for one time unit (as defined here), depending on the time section al-zampa, and upon the expiration of its time quantum, is sent back to the end of the queue. This is repeated until all processes finish executing.\n\nIn this step, the Gantt chart illustrates the order in which processes execute.\n\nTo obtain the waiting time for each process, we need to know when it finished firing and how long it waited while other job arrivals were being executed. Thus waiting time can be calculated as:\n\nWhere Turnaround time is the total time spent from arrival to completion.\n\nFor each process, we find the waiting times as follows:\n\nAverage waiting time is the sum of waiting times divided by the number of processes:\n\nConsidering the quantum time to be 2ms, each process is executed for a maximum of 2ms. If it is not completed, it is sent to the back of the queue for its next turn.\n• The Ready Queue is initially empty but will start filling as processes arrive.\n• Cycle 1: Process A executes first, followed by Process B, and then Process C.\n• Cycle 2: Process A executes again, followed by Process B, which now finishes. Then Process C continues to run.\n• Cycle 3: Process A finishes, and then Process C runs.\n\nAlgorithm of Round Robin Scheduling program in C\n\nLet’s look at some terminology before entering the algorithm:\n• Burst time: It refers to the time required for a task to complete its execution on the CPU without any interruption\n\nIt starts when the task gets CPU access till it finishes execution, ignoring any wait time.\n• Arrival time: The specific time when a task enters the ready queue, becoming eligible for CPU scheduling.\n• Process ID: A unique identifier assigned to each task for managing and tracking purposes.\n• Waiting time: The total time a process spends in the ready queue, waiting for its next CPU time slot.\n\nStep 3: Allocation of time quantum: Each task is assigned a fixed time quantum for execution.\n\nStep 4: Execute processes: All tasks are executed for a time quantum or until the task is completed and either removed from the queue (if finished) or moved to the back of the queue till its next turn.\n\nStep 5: Repeat steps: Continue the cycle till all tasks are executed.\n\nIn a sequential arrival time, each process comes to the CPU one after the other, increasing the process arrival time within a unit interval(i.e., 1 or any other constant). Hence, in this case, all processes were sequentially arriving at the CPU and are scheduled using the Round Robin algorithm.\n\nHere is the example of sequential arrival time:\n\nThis program implements the Round Robin scheduling algorithm. It receives the number of processes, their arrival and burst times as inputs. Then, once the waiting time, turnaround time, and averages for all processes are calculated, the CPU time is allocated to each process in the time slices of the fixed time quantum.\n\nC Program of Round Robin Algorithm with Zero Arrival Time\n\nCPU scheduling with zero arrival time is a situation in which all the processes arrive at 0. The scheduler does not discriminate between arrival times; all these processes are available to the CPU at the same point in time, thus making it focus only on the burst times (execution times) of the processes.\n\nStep 1: Initialize the processes with the parameters timeQuantum, current_time, waiting_time, turnaround_time, completed_processes.\n\nStep 2: While less than the total number of processes has been completed:\n\nThis above code uses a simulation of Round Robin scheduling by assigning a fixed quantum time for every process. It proceeds in cycles along the processes, executing each in cycles, updating burst times, and then calculating waiting and turnaround times for all processes until completion.\n• Previous Code: Considers specific arrival times. It needs to be checked whether a process has arrived or not before its execution\n• Previous Code: Increments currentTime when no processes are ready to execute. As the CPU is idle.\n• Current Code: No idle handling is needed since the CPU is always busy.\n• Current Code: Turnaround time = Completion time, as the arrival time for all processes is 0.\n• Previous Code: More complex due to dynamic arrival times and idle handling.\n• Current Code: Simpler due to the assumption of simultaneous arrival.\n\nC Program of Round Robin Algorithm with Different Arrival Time for All Processes\n\nIn Round Robin (RR) scheduling, each process is cyclically assigned a fixed time quantum (or time slice). When there are different arrival times for the processes, the scheduler must consider the arrival time of each process before scheduling it. Round Robin with different arrival times works as follows:\n\nStep 2: While not all processes are completed:\n• Else, increment current_time by remaining burst, update waiting_time and turnaround_time, mark as completed.\n\nIn the above example, the round robin scheduling with varying arrival times allocates CPU time in fixed time slices that cycle through the set of processes. Processes can start as per their arrival time, and if they don't complete in the quantum time frame, then they are suspended or preempted and get placed back in the queue. The process of CPU execution continues until all processes are executed.\n\nDynamically checks which processes have arrived at each time step.\n\nIncrements currentTime if no process is ready to simulate the CPU waiting for a new process.\n\nAllocates CPU time evenly to all processes using the round-robin method.\n\nProcesses are preempted after their time quantum expires and placed at the end of the queue.\n\nProcesses are cycled through the queue, ensuring continuous execution until completion.\n\nContext switching overhead can increase with small time quanta, so a balance is needed.\n\n1. Used in time-sharing systems, where multiple users have access\n• Imagine an institute where numerous students are running programs on a single server. The round robin algorithm ensures that no single program takes up the CPU time entirely.\n• In the wi-fi network at home, the round-robin program ensures no single device hogs the bandwidth.\n\n4. In interactive systems, a responsive user interface is very ensured by round robin.\n• In word processing applications, multiple processes like typing, spell-check, and auto-saving co-occur, preventing the application from freezing.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Round Robin Scheduling in C\n\nHere are the advantages and disadvantages of round robin scheduling in C:\n• Every process gets an equal share of CPU time, ensuring fairness.\n• Avoid starvation by permitting all processes to re-schedule after their quantum time.\n• Allows no process to wait indefinitely through cyclic scheduling.\n• Smaller time slices give rise to greater context switching overhead, making them less efficient.\n• Frequent switching incurs overhead and increases even more with smaller time slices.\n• It could delay processes which are priority.\n\nRound-robin scheduling ensures fairness and simplicity. Its cyclic ensures that all programs get fair CPU time. It is ideal for time-sharing and real-time systems. It sheds light on process scheduling and the OS's efficiency in managing its resources.\n\n1. What is Round Robin scheduling in operating systems?\n\nRound Robin(RR) is a preemptive CPU scheduling algorithm that assigns a fixed time quantum to each process. After the quantum expires, the process is preempted and placed at the back of the queue, allowing other methods to work on a particular CPU cycle.\n\nRound Robin scheduling works by maintaining a circular queue of processes. Each process is allocated a time quantum, and when its time quantum expires, the process is moved to the earliest not-yet-finished process in the same queue, ensuring fair CPU time distribution across all processes.\n\n3. What are the advantages of Round Robin scheduling?\n\nRound Robin is a scheduling algorithm emphasising fairness by making every process wait an equal time quantum. Starvation of processes is avoided, as the algorithm is also fair. Round Robin is also a widely accepted way of sharing time, in which all processes are treated equally.\n\n4. What are the limitations of Round Robin scheduling?\n\nThe inefficiency of Round Robin scheduling occurs in those processes characterised by high-caliber limits. When a long-running process is transacted with other running processes, an inordinate number of context switches are made that incur overhead. With a small time quantum, there would be excessive switching, causing performance to plummet.\n\nRound Robin cannot be given the right credit to offer a service to real-time systems, since it does not treat the procedures according to their deadline. Real-time systems use scheduling wherein RMS can be treated with great robustness, as this scheduling relates to timing constraints and urgency of the tasks.\n\n6. What is the Round Robin process scheduling in C?\n\nRound Robin process scheduling in C is the algorithm implementation required to manage the process in a queue and assign a fixed time slice to each. Once a process's time slice runs out, it is placed at the end of the queue."

        "document": "The problem with round robin is that tasks aren't equal.\n\nFor CPU bound tasks; if you've got an extremely important task and thousands of unimportant tasks, then all those unimportant tasks cripple the performance of the important task. For this case it doesn't matter how big the time slices are.\n\nFor IO bound tasks, round robin causes bad latency. If an important task unblocks (e.g. wakes up after calling \"sleep()\", receives file IO it was waiting for, etc) then it may have to wait for thousands of unimportant tasks to work their way through their time slices before the important task gets a chance to do anything. Reducing the time slice length will reduce the time it takes before the important task can start doing something useful, but will also reduce the amount of time the important task gets to do something useful.\n\nNote: You might be tempted to \"fix\" this by making tasks that unblock go to the head of the list. In this case an important task can be starved forever just because unimportant tasks keep sleeping and waking up.\n\nEssentially, round-robin is a steaming pile of \"useless\" and it won't matter what you do until you replace it with completely different scheduling algorithm that has at least some respect for the importance/priority of different tasks.\n\nFor an oversimplified example; you could have 3 different task priorities, where the OS only ever runs the highest priority tasks that it can (including making sure higher priority tasks preempt lower priority tasks immediately) and round-robin is used for tasks at the same priority. In this case, you could could have different time slice lengths for different priorities (e.g. high priority tasks only get 1 ms, medium priority tasks get 10 ms, low priority tasks get 125 ms).\n\nFor a \"less oversimplified\" example; you could have several completely different scheduling policies (e.g. one for real-time tasks, one for normal tasks, one for background/idle tasks) that all use different approaches (e.g. earliest deadline first, variable time slice, etc); where there's 256 tasks priorities for each scheduling policy."

        "document": "Round Robin Scheduling is one of the most popular CPU scheduling algorithms used in operating systems. This algorithm is designed to handle processes efficiently by assigning a fixed time slice or quantum to each process.\n\nHowever, when processes arrive at different times, the scheduling becomes slightly more complex but remains true to its principles. In this article, we’ll explore how the Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm effectively handles this situation. Also, we’ll see its program implementation.\n\nCharacteristics of RR Scheduling Algo with Different Arrival Time\n• Handles Dynamic Arrival : Processes can arrive at different times, and the scheduler dynamically adds them to the ready queue as they arrive, ensuring no process is overlooked.\n• Time Quantum Distribution : Each process is allocated a fixed time slice (time quantum) for execution, regardless of its arrival time.\n• Preemptive Execution : If a process doesn’t complete within its time quantum, it is preempted and added back to the queue for its next turn, even if new processes have arrived.\n• Fair Scheduling : Even with different arrival times, all processes are treated fairly, and no process is given priority over others by default.\n• Minimizes Starvation : New processes are regularly added to the queue, and the algorithm ensures that all processes get CPU time, reducing the risk of starvation.\n• Efficient Queue Updates : The ready queue is updated dynamically as new processes arrive, maintaining a circular queue structure for smooth execution.\n• Impact on Turnaround and Waiting Time : Processes arriving later may experience slightly increased waiting times, but the algorithm works to minimize delays by rotating through all tasks.\n\nExample of Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm for the Different Arrival Time:\n\nAfter all these we get the three times which are:\n• Completion Time: the time taken for a process to complete.\n• Turn Around Time: total time the process exists in the system. (completion time – arrival time).\n• Waiting Time: total time waiting for their complete execution. (turn around time – burst time ).\n\nHow to implement in a programming language\n• None Declare arrival[], burst[], wait[], turn[] arrays and initialize them. Also declare a timer variable and initialize it to zero. To sustain the original burst array create another array (temp_burst[]) and copy all the values of burst array in it.\n• None To keep a check we create another array of bool type which keeps the record of whether a process is completed or not. we also need to maintain a queue array which contains the process indices (initially the array is filled with 0).\n• None Now we increment the timer variable until the first process arrives and when it does, we add the process index to the queue array.\n• None Now we execute the first process until the time quanta and during that time quanta, we check whether any other process has arrived or not and if it has then we add the index in the queue (by calling the fxn. queueUpdation()).\n• None Now, after doing the above steps if a process has finished, we store its exit time and execute the next process in the queue array. Else, we move the currently executed process at the end of the queue (by calling another fxn. queueMaintainence()) when the time slice expires.\n• None The above steps are then repeated until all the processes have been completely executed. If a scenario arises where there are some processes left but they have not arrived yet, then we shall wait and the CPU will remain idle during this interval.\n\nBelow is the implementation of the above approach:\n\n//adds the incoming process to the ready queue Enter the arrival time of the processes : \" Enter the burst time of the processes : \" //Incrementing Timer until the first process arrives //Checking and Updating the ready queue until all the processes arrive //If a process is completed then store its exit time //and mark it as completed //checks whether or not CPU is idle //after each premption in the ready Queue \"\n\nEnter the arrival time of the processes : \" \"\n\nEnter the burst time of the processes : \" //Incrementing Timer until the first process arrives //Updating the ready queue until all the processes arrive //checks whether or not CPU is idle //Maintaining the entries of processes after each premption in the ready Queue //adds the index of the arriving process(if any) # adds the index of the arriving process(if any) Enter the arrival time of the processes :\" Enter the burst time of the processes :\" # Incrementing Timer until the first process arrives # Updating the ready queue until all the processes arrive # checks whether or not CPU is idle # Maintaining the entries of processes aftereach premption in the ready Queue # This code is contributed by lokeshmvs21. // for not effecting the actual array // these condition for if // arrival is not on zero // check that if there come before qtime // is any have less arrival time // according to ith is process // if no process is come on the critical // for exit the while loop // This code is contributed by Rajput-Ji //adds the incoming process to the ready queue //Incrementing Timer until the first process arrives // Checking and Updating the ready queue until all the processes arrive // If a process is completed then store its exit time // and mark it as completed // checks whether or not CPU is idle //after each premption in the ready Queue // This code is contributed by akashish_.\n\nIn case of any queries or a problem with the code, please write it in the comment section.\n\nNote: A slightly optimized version of the above-implemented code could be done by using Queue data structure as follows:\n\n// the amount of CPU time remaining after each execution * At every time quantum or when a process has been executed before the time quantum, * check for any new arrivals and push them into the queue // checking if any processes has arrived // if so, push them in the ready Queue. * At every iteration, the burst time of the processes in the queue are handled using this method // if the process is going to be finished executing, // ie, when it's remaining burst time is less than time quantum // mark it completed and increment the current time // and calculate its waiting time and turnaround time // if all the processes are not yet inserted in the queue, // then check for new arrivals // the process is not done yet.
