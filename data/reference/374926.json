This manual describes GNU make, which was implemented by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath. Development since Version 3.76 has been handled by Paul D. Smith.\n\nOur examples show C programs, since they are most common, but you can use make with any programming language whose compiler can be run with a shell command. Indeed, make is not limited to programs. You can use it to describe any task where some files must be updated automatically from others whenever the others change.\n\nTo prepare to use make, you must write a file called the makefile that describes the relationships among files in your program and provides commands for updating each file. In a program, typically, the executable file is updated from object files, which are in turn made by compiling source files.\n\nOnce a suitable makefile exists, each time you change some source files, this simple shell command:\n\nsuffices to perform all necessary recompilations. The make program uses the makefile data base and the last-modification times of the files to decide which of the files need to be updated. For each of those files, it issues the commands recorded in the data base.\n\nYou can provide command line arguments to make to control which files should be recompiled, or how. See section How to Run make.\n\nHow to Read This Manual\n\nIf you are new to make, or are looking for a general introduction, read the first few sections of each chapter, skipping the later sections. In each chapter, the first few sections contain introductory or general information and the later sections contain specialized or technical information. The exception is section An Introduction to Makefiles, all of which is introductory.\n\nIf you are familiar with other make programs, see section Features of GNU make, which lists the enhancements GNU make has, and section Incompatibilities and Missing Features, which explains the few things GNU make lacks that others have.\n\nFor a quick summary, see section Summary of Options, section Quick Reference, and section Special Built-in Target Names.\n\nIf you have problems with GNU make or think you’ve found a bug, please report it to the developers; we cannot promise to do anything but we might well want to fix it.\n\nBefore reporting a bug, make sure you’ve actually found a real bug. Carefully reread the documentation and see if it really says you can do what you’re trying to do. If it’s not clear whether you should be able to do something or not, report that too; it’s a bug in the documentation!\n\nBefore reporting a bug or trying to fix it yourself, try to isolate it to the smallest possible makefile that reproduces the problem. Then send us the makefile and the exact results make gave you. Also say what you expected to occur; this will help us decide whether the problem was really in the documentation.\n\nOnce you’ve got a precise problem, please send electronic mail to:\n\nPlease include the version number of make you are using. You can get this information with the command . Be sure also to include the type of machine and operating system you are using. If possible, include the contents of the file that is generated by the configuration process.\n\nYou need a file called a makefile to tell make what to do. Most often, the makefile tells make how to compile and link a program.\n\nIn this chapter, we will discuss a simple makefile that describes how to compile and link a text editor which consists of eight C source files and three header files. The makefile can also tell make how to run miscellaneous commands when explicitly asked (for example, to remove certain files as a clean-up operation). To see a more complex example of a makefile, see section Complex Makefile Example.\n\nWhen make recompiles the editor, each changed C source file must be recompiled. If a header file has changed, each C source file that includes the header file must be recompiled to be safe. Each compilation produces an object file corresponding to the source file. Finally, if any source file has been recompiled, all the object files, whether newly made or saved from previous compilations, must be linked together to produce the new executable editor.\n\nWhat a Rule Looks Like\n\nA simple makefile consists of “rules” with the following shape:\n\nA target is usually the name of a file that is generated by a program; examples of targets are executable or object files. A target can also be the name of an action to carry out, such as (see section Phony Targets).\n\nA prerequisite is a file that is used as input to create the target. A target often depends on several files.\n\nA command is an action that make carries out. A rule may have more than one command, each on its own line. Please note: you need to put a tab character at the beginning of every command line! This is an obscurity that catches the unwary.\n\nUsually a command is in a rule with prerequisites and serves to create a target file if any of the prerequisites change. However, the rule that specifies commands for the target need not have prerequisites. For example, the rule containing the delete command associated with the target does not have prerequisites.\n\nA rule, then, explains how and when to remake certain files which are the targets of the particular rule. make carries out the commands on the prerequisites to create or update the target. A rule can also explain how and when to carry out an action. See section Writing Rules.\n\nA makefile may contain other text besides rules, but a simple makefile need only contain rules. Rules may look somewhat more complicated than shown in this template, but all fit the pattern more or less.\n\nHere is a straightforward makefile that describes the way an executable file called edit depends on eight object files which, in turn, depend on eight C source and three header files.\n\nIn this example, all the C files include , but only those defining editing commands include , and only low level files that change the editor buffer include .\n\nedit : main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \\ insert.o search.o files.o utils.o cc -o edit main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \\ insert.o search.o files.o utils.omain.o : main.c defs.h cc -c main.ckbd.o : kbd.c defs.h command.h cc -c kbd.c command.o : command.c defs.h command.h cc -c command.c display.o : display.c defs.h buffer.h cc -c display.c insert.o : insert.c defs.h buffer.h cc -c insert.c search.o : search.c defs.h buffer.h cc -c search.c files.o : files.c defs.h buffer.h command.h cc -c files.c utils.o : utils.c defs.h cc -c utils.cclean : rm edit main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \\ insert.o search.o files.o utils.o\n\nWe split each long line into two lines using backslash-newline; this is like using one long line, but is easier to read.\n\nTo use this makefile to create the executable file called , type:\n\nTo use this makefile to delete the executable file and all the object files from the directory, type:\n\nIn the example makefile, the targets include the executable file , and the object files and . The prerequisites are files such as and . In fact, each file is both a target and a prerequisite. Commands include and .\n\nWhen a target is a file, it needs to be recompiled or relinked if any of its prerequisites change. In addition, any prerequisites that are themselves automatically generated should be updated first. In this example, depends on each of the eight object files; the object file depends on the source file and on the header file .\n\nA shell command follows each line that contains a target and prerequisites. These shell commands say how to update the target file. A tab character must come at the beginning of every command line to distinguish commands lines from other lines in the makefile. (Bear in mind that make does not know anything about how the commands work. It is up to you to supply commands that will update the target file properly. All make does is execute the commands in the rule you have specified when the target file needs to be updated.)\n\nThe target is not a file, but merely the name of an action. Since you normally do not want to carry out the actions in this rule, is not a prerequisite of any other rule. Consequently, make never does anything with it unless you tell it specifically. Note that this rule not only is not a prerequisite, it also does not have any prerequisites, so the only purpose of the rule is to run the specified commands. Targets that do not refer to files but are just actions are called phony targets. See section Phony Targets, for information about this kind of target. See section Errors in Commands, to see how to cause make to ignore errors from rm or any other command.\n\nBy default, make starts with the first target (not targets whose names start with ). This is called the default goal. (Goals are the targets that make strives ultimately to update. See section Arguments to Specify the Goals.)\n\nIn the simple example of the previous section, the default goal is to update the executable program ; therefore, we put that rule first.\n\nThus, when you give the command:\n\nmake reads the makefile in the current directory and begins by processing the first rule. In the example, this rule is for relinking ; but before make can fully process this rule, it must process the rules for the files that depends on, which in this case are the object files. Each of these files is processed according to its own rule. These rules say to update each file by compiling its source file. The recompilation must be done if the source file, or any of the header files named as prerequisites, is more recent than the object file, or if the object file does not exist.\n\nThe other rules are processed because their targets appear as prerequisites of the goal. If some other rule is not depended on by the goal (or anything it depends on, etc.), that rule is not processed, unless you tell make to do so (with a command such as make clean).\n\nBefore recompiling an object file, make considers updating its prerequisites, the source file and header files. This makefile does not specify anything to be done for them–the and files are not the targets of any rules–so make does nothing for these files. But make would update automatically generated C programs, such as those made by Bison or Yacc, by their own rules at this time.\n\nAfter recompiling whichever object files need it, make decides whether to relink . This must be done if the file does not exist, or if any of the object files are newer than it. If an object file was just recompiled, it is now newer than , so is relinked.\n\nThus, if we change the file and run make, make will compile that file to update , and then link . If we change the file and run make, make will recompile the object files , and and then link the file .\n\nIn our example, we had to list all the object files twice in the rule for (repeated here):\n\nSuch duplication is error-prone; if a new object file is added to the system, we might add it to one list and forget the other. We can eliminate the risk and simplify the makefile by using a variable. Variables allow a text string to be defined once and substituted in multiple places later (see section How to Use Variables).\n\nIt is standard practice for every makefile to have a variable named objects, OBJECTS, objs, OBJS, obj, or OBJ which is a list of all object file names. We would define such a variable objects with a line like this in the makefile:\n\nThen, each place we want to put a list of the object file names, we can substitute the variable’s value by writing (see section How to Use Variables).\n\nHere is how the complete simple makefile looks when you use a variable for the object files:\n\nobjects = main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \\ insert.o search.o files.o utils.oedit : $(objects) cc -o edit $(objects)main.o : main.c defs.h cc -c main.c kbd.o : kbd.c defs.h command.h cc -c kbd.c command.o : command.c defs.h command.h cc -c command.c display.o : display.c defs.h buffer.h cc -c display.c insert.o : insert.c defs.h buffer.h cc -c insert.c search.o : search.c defs.h buffer.h cc -c search.c files.o : files.c defs.h buffer.h command.h cc -c files.c utils.o : utils.c defs.h cc -c utils.cclean : rm edit $(objects)\n\nIt is not necessary to spell out the commands for compiling the individual C source files, because make can figure them out: it has an implicit rule for updating a file from a correspondingly named file using a command. For example, it will use the command to compile into . We can therefore omit the commands from the rules for the object files. See section Using Implicit Rules.\n\nWhen a file is used automatically in this way, it is also automatically added to the list of prerequisites. We can therefore omit the files from the prerequisites, provided we omit the commands.\n\nHere is the entire example, with both of these changes, and a variable objects as suggested above:\n\nThis is how we would write the makefile in actual practice. (The complications associated with are described elsewhere. See section Phony Targets, and section Errors in Commands.)\n\nBecause implicit rules are so convenient, they are important. You will see them used frequently.\n\nWhen the objects of a makefile are created only by implicit rules, an alternative style of makefile is possible. In this style of makefile, you group entries by their prerequisites instead of by their targets. Here is what one looks like:\n\nHere is given as a prerequisite of all the object files; and are prerequisites of the specific object files listed for them.\n\nWhether this is better is a matter of taste: it is more compact, but some people dislike it because they find it clearer to put all the information about each target in one place.\n\nCompiling a program is not the only thing you might want to write rules for. Makefiles commonly tell how to do a few other things besides compiling a program: for example, how to delete all the object files and executables so that the directory is .\n\nHere is how we could write a make rule for cleaning our example editor:\n\nIn practice, we might want to write the rule in a somewhat more complicated manner to handle unanticipated situations. We would do this:\n\nThis prevents make from getting confused by an actual file called and causes it to continue in spite of errors from rm. (See section Phony Targets, and section Errors in Commands.)\n\nA rule such as this should not be placed at the beginning of the makefile, because we do not want it to run by default! Thus, in the example makefile, we want the rule for edit, which recompiles the editor, to remain the default goal.\n\nSince clean is not a prerequisite of edit, this rule will not run at all if we give the command with no arguments. In order to make the rule run, we have to type . See section How to Run make.\n\nThe information that tells make how to recompile a system comes from reading a data base called the makefile.\n\nMakefiles contain five kinds of things: explicit rules, implicit rules, variable definitions, directives, and comments. Rules, variables, and directives are described at length in later chapters.\n• An explicit rule says when and how to remake one or more files, called the rule’s targets. It lists the other files that the targets depend on, call the prerequisites of the target, and may also give commands to use to create or update the targets. See section Writing Rules.\n• An implicit rule says when and how to remake a class of files based on their names. It describes how a target may depend on a file with a name similar to the target and gives commands to create or update such a target. See section Using Implicit Rules.\n• A variable definition is a line that specifies a text string value for a variable that can be substituted into the text later. The simple makefile example shows a variable definition for objects as a list of all object files (see section Variables Make Makefiles Simpler).\n• A directive is a command for make to do something special while reading the makefile. These include:\n• Reading another makefile (see section Including Other Makefiles).\n• Deciding (based on the values of variables) whether to use or ignore a part of the makefile (see section Conditional Parts of Makefiles).\n• Defining a variable from a verbatim string containing multiple lines (see section Defining Variables Verbatim).\n• in a line of a makefile starts a comment. It and the rest of the line are ignored, except that a trailing backslash not escaped by another backslash will continue the comment across multiple lines. Comments may appear on any of the lines in the makefile, except within a define directive, and perhaps within commands (where the shell decides what is a comment). A line containing just a comment (with perhaps spaces before it) is effectively blank, and is ignored.\n\nWhat Name to Give Your Makefile\n\nBy default, when make looks for the makefile, it tries the following names, in order: , and .\n\nNormally you should call your makefile either or . (We recommend because it appears prominently near the beginning of a directory listing, right near other important files such as .) The first name checked, , is not recommended for most makefiles. You should use this name if you have a makefile that is specific to GNU make, and will not be understood by other versions of make. Other make programs look for and , but not .\n\nIf make finds none of these names, it does not use any makefile. Then you must specify a goal with a command argument, and make will attempt to figure out how to remake it using only its built-in implicit rules. See section Using Implicit Rules.\n\nIf you want to use a nonstandard name for your makefile, you can specify the makefile name with the or option. The arguments or tell make to read the file name as the makefile. If you use more than one or option, you can specify several makefiles. All the makefiles are effectively concatenated in the order specified. The default makefile names , and are not checked automatically if you specify or .\n\nThe include directive tells make to suspend reading the current makefile and read one or more other makefiles before continuing. The directive is a line in the makefile that looks like this:\n\nfilenames can contain shell file name patterns.\n\nExtra spaces are allowed and ignored at the beginning of the line, but a tab is not allowed. (If the line begins with a tab, it will be considered a command line.) Whitespace is required between include and the file names, and between file names; extra whitespace is ignored there and at the end of the directive. A comment starting with is allowed at the end of the line. If the file names contain any variable or function references, they are expanded. See section How to Use Variables.\n\nFor example, if you have three files, , , and , and $(bar) expands to bish bash, then the following expression\n\nWhen make processes an include directive, it suspends reading of the containing makefile and reads from each listed file in turn. When that is finished, make resumes reading the makefile in which the directive appears.\n\nOne occasion for using include directives is when several programs, handled by individual makefiles in various directories, need to use a common set of variable definitions (see section Setting Variables) or pattern rules (see section Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules).\n\nAnother such occasion is when you want to generate prerequisites from source files automatically; the prerequisites can be put in a file that is included by the main makefile. This practice is generally cleaner than that of somehow appending the prerequisites to the end of the main makefile as has been traditionally done with other versions of make. See section Generating Prerequisites Automatically.\n\nIf the specified name does not start with a slash, and the file is not found in the current directory, several other directories are searched. First, any directories you have specified with the or option are searched (see section Summary of Options). Then the following directories (if they exist) are searched, in this order: (normally (1)) , , .\n\nIf an included makefile cannot be found in any of these directories, a warning message is generated, but it is not an immediately fatal error; processing of the makefile containing the include continues. Once it has finished reading makefiles, make will try to remake any that are out of date or don’t exist. See section How Makefiles Are Remade. Only after it has tried to find a way to remake a makefile and failed, will make diagnose the missing makefile as a fatal error.\n\nIf you want make to simply ignore a makefile which does not exist and cannot be remade, with no error message, use the -include directive instead of include, like this:\n\nThis is acts like include in every way except that there is no error (not even a warning) if any of the filenames do not exist. For compatibility with some other make implementations, sinclude is another name for -include.\n\nIf the environment variable MAKEFILES is defined, make considers its value as a list of names (separated by whitespace) of additional makefiles to be read before the others. This works much like the include directive: various directories are searched for those files (see section Including Other Makefiles). In addition, the default goal is never taken from one of these makefiles and it is not an error if the files listed in MAKEFILES are not found.\n\nThe main use of MAKEFILES is in communication between recursive invocations of make (see section Recursive Use of make). It usually is not desirable to set the environment variable before a top-level invocation of make, because it is usually better not to mess with a makefile from outside. However, if you are running make without a specific makefile, a makefile in MAKEFILES can do useful things to help the built-in implicit rules work better, such as defining search paths (see section Searching Directories for Prerequisites).\n\nSome users are tempted to set MAKEFILES in the environment automatically on login, and program makefiles to expect this to be done. This is a very bad idea, because such makefiles will fail to work if run by anyone else. It is much better to write explicit include directives in the makefiles. See section Including Other Makefiles.\n\nSometimes makefiles can be remade from other files, such as RCS or SCCS files. If a makefile can be remade from other files, you probably want make to get an up-to-date version of the makefile to read in.\n\nTo this end, after reading in all makefiles, make will consider each as a goal target and attempt to update it. If a makefile has a rule which says how to update it (found either in that very makefile or in another one) or if an implicit rule applies to it (see section Using Implicit Rules), it will be updated if necessary. After all makefiles have been checked, if any have actually been changed, make starts with a clean slate and reads all the makefiles over again. (It will also attempt to update each of them over again, but normally this will not change them again, since they are already up to date.)\n\nIf you know that one or more of your makefiles cannot be remade and you want to keep make from performing an implicit rule search on them, perhaps for efficiency reasons, you can use any normal method of preventing implicit rule lookup to do so. For example, you can write an explicit rule with the makefile as the target, and an empty command string (see section Using Empty Commands).\n\nIf the makefiles specify a double-colon rule to remake a file with commands but no prerequisites, that file will always be remade (see section Double-Colon Rules). In the case of makefiles, a makefile that has a double-colon rule with commands but no prerequisites will be remade every time make is run, and then again after make starts over and reads the makefiles in again. This would cause an infinite loop: make would constantly remake the makefile, and never do anything else. So, to avoid this, make will not attempt to remake makefiles which are specified as targets of a double-colon rule with commands but no prerequisites.\n\nIf you do not specify any makefiles to be read with or options, make will try the default makefile names; see section What Name to Give Your Makefile. Unlike makefiles explicitly requested with or options, make is not certain that these makefiles should exist. However, if a default makefile does not exist but can be created by running make rules, you probably want the rules to be run so that the makefile can be used.\n\nTherefore, if none of the default makefiles exists, make will try to make each of them in the same order in which they are searched for (see section What Name to Give Your Makefile) until it succeeds in making one, or it runs out of names to try. Note that it is not an error if make cannot find or make any makefile; a makefile is not always necessary.\n\nWhen you use the or option (see section Instead of Executing the Commands), you would not want to use an out-of-date makefile to decide which targets to touch. So the option has no effect on updating makefiles; they are really updated even if is specified. Likewise, (or ) and (or ) do not prevent updating of makefiles, because an out-of-date makefile would result in the wrong output for other targets. Thus, will update , read it in, and then print the commands to update and its prerequisites without running them. The commands printed for will be those specified in the updated contents of .\n\nHowever, on occasion you might actually wish to prevent updating of even the makefiles. You can do this by specifying the makefiles as goals in the command line as well as specifying them as makefiles. When the makefile name is specified explicitly as a goal, the options and so on do apply to them.\n\nThus, would read the makefile , print the commands needed to update it without actually running them, and then print the commands needed to update without running them. The commands for will be those specified by the existing contents of .\n\nSometimes it is useful to have a makefile that is mostly just like another makefile. You can often use the directive to include one in the other, and add more targets or variable definitions. However, if the two makefiles give different commands for the same target, make will not let you just do this. But there is another way.\n\nIn the containing makefile (the one that wants to include the other), you can use a match-anything pattern rule to say that to remake any target that cannot be made from the information in the containing makefile, make should look in another makefile. See section Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules, for more information on pattern rules.\n\nFor example, if you have a makefile called that says how to make the target (and other targets), you can write a makefile called that contains:\n\nIf you say , make will find , read it, and see that to make , it needs to run the command . If you say , make will find no way to make in , so it will use the commands from the pattern rule: . If provides a rule for updating , make will apply the rule. And likewise for any other target that does not say how to make.\n\nThe way this works is that the pattern rule has a pattern of just , so it matches any target whatever. The rule specifies a prerequisite , to guarantee that the commands will be run even if the target file already exists. We give target empty commands to prevent make from searching for an implicit rule to build it–otherwise it would apply the same match-anything rule to itself and create a prerequisite loop!\n\nGNU make does its work in two distinct phases. During the first phase it reads all the makefiles, included makefiles, etc. and internalizes all the variables and their values, implicit and explicit rules, and constructs a dependency graph of all the targets and their prerequisites. During the second phase, make uses these internal structures to determine what targets will need to be rebuilt and to invoke the rules necessary to do so.\n\nIt’s important to understand this two-phase approach because it has a direct impact on how variable and function expansion happens; this is often a source of some confusion when writing makefiles. Here we will present a summary of the phases in which expansion happens for different constructs within the makefile. We say that expansion is immediate if it happens during the first phase: in this case make will expand any variables or functions in that section of a construct as the makefile is parsed. We say that expansion is deferred if expansion is not performed immediately. Expansion of deferred construct is not performed until either the construct appears later in an immediate context, or until the second phase.\n\nYou may not be familiar with some of these constructs yet. You can reference this section as you become familiar with them, in later chapters.\n\nVariable definitions are parsed as follows:\n\nimmediate = deferred immediate ?= deferred immediate := immediate immediate += deferred or immediate define immediate deferredendef\n\nFor the append operator, , the right-hand side is considered immediate if the variable was previously set as a simple variable ( ), and deferred otherwise.\n\nAll instances of conditional syntax are parsed immediately, in their entirety; this includes the ifdef, ifeq, ifndef, and ifneq forms.\n\nA rule is always expanded the same way, regardless of the form:\n\nThat is, the target and prerequisite sections are expanded immediately, and the commands used to construct the target are always deferred. This general rule is true for explicit rules, pattern rules, suffix rules, static pattern rules, and simple prerequisite definitions.\n\nA rule appears in the makefile and says when and how to remake certain files, called the rule’s targets (most often only one per rule). It lists the other files that are the prerequisites of the target, and commands to use to create or update the target.\n\nThe order of rules is not significant, except for determining the default goal: the target for make to consider, if you do not otherwise specify one. The default goal is the target of the first rule in the first makefile. If the first rule has multiple targets, only the first target is taken as the default. There are two exceptions: a target starting with a period is not a default unless it contains one or more slashes, , as well; and, a target that defines a pattern rule has no effect on the default goal. (See section Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules.)\n\nTherefore, we usually write the makefile so that the first rule is the one for compiling the entire program or all the programs described by the makefile (often with a target called ). See section Arguments to Specify the Goals.\n\nIn general, a rule looks like this:\n\nor like this:\n\nThe targets are file names, separated by spaces. Wildcard characters may be used (see section Using Wildcard Characters in File Names) and a name of the form represents member m in archive file a (see section Archive Members as Targets). Usually there is only one target per rule, but occasionally there is a reason to have more (see section Multiple Targets in a Rule).\n\nThe command lines start with a tab character. The first command may appear on the line after the prerequisites, with a tab character, or may appear on the same line, with a semicolon. Either way, the effect is the same. See section Writing the Commands in Rules.\n\nBecause dollar signs are used to start variable references, if you really want a dollar sign in a rule you must write two of them, (see section How to Use Variables). You may split a long line by inserting a backslash followed by a newline, but this is not required, as make places no limit on the length of a line in a makefile.\n\nA rule tells make two things: when the targets are out of date, and how to update them when necessary.\n\nThe criterion for being out of date is specified in terms of the prerequisites, which consist of file names separated by spaces. (Wildcards and archive members (see section Using make to Update Archive Files) are allowed here too.) A target is out of date if it does not exist or if it is older than any of the prerequisites (by comparison of last-modification times). The idea is that the contents of the target file are computed based on information in the prerequisites, so if any of the prerequisites changes, the contents of the existing target file are no longer necessarily valid.\n\nHow to update is specified by commands. These are lines to be executed by the shell (normally ), but with some extra features (see section Writing the Commands in Rules).\n\nA single file name can specify many files using wildcard characters. The wildcard characters in make are , and , the same as in the Bourne shell. For example, specifies a list of all the files (in the working directory) whose names end in .\n\nThe character at the beginning of a file name also has special significance. If alone, or followed by a slash, it represents your home directory. For example expands to . If the is followed by a word, the string represents the home directory of the user named by that word. For example expands to . On systems which don’t have a home directory for each user (such as MS-DOS or MS-Windows), this functionality can be simulated by setting the environment variable HOME.\n\nWildcard expansion happens automatically in targets, in prerequisites, and in commands (where the shell does the expansion). In other contexts, wildcard expansion happens only if you request it explicitly with the wildcard function.\n\nThe special significance of a wildcard character can be turned off by preceding it with a backslash. Thus, would refer to a specific file whose name consists of , an asterisk, and .\n\nWildcards can be used in the commands of a rule, where they are expanded by the shell. For example, here is a rule to delete all the object files:\n\nWildcards are also useful in the prerequisites of a rule. With the following rule in the makefile, will print all the files that have changed since the last time you printed them:\n\nThis rule uses as an empty target file; see section Empty Target Files to Record Events. (The automatic variable is used to print only those files that have changed; see section Automatic Variables.)\n\nWildcard expansion does not happen when you define a variable. Thus, if you write this:\n\nthen the value of the variable objects is the actual string . However, if you use the value of objects in a target, prerequisite or command, wildcard expansion will take place at that time. To set objects to the expansion, instead use:\n\nNow here is an example of a naive way of using wildcard expansion, that does not do what you would intend. Suppose you would like to say that the executable file is made from all the object files in the directory, and you write this:\n\nThe value of objects is the actual string . Wildcard expansion happens in the rule for , so that each existing file becomes a prerequisite of and will be recompiled if necessary.\n\nBut what if you delete all the files? When a wildcard matches no files, it is left as it is, so then will depend on the oddly-named file . Since no such file is likely to exist, make will give you an error saying it cannot figure out how to make . This is not what you want!\n\nActually it is possible to obtain the desired result with wildcard expansion, but you need more sophisticated techniques, including the wildcard function and string substitution. These are described in the following section.\n\nMicrosoft operating systems (MS-DOS and MS-Windows) use backslashes to separate directories in pathnames, like so:\n\nThis is equivalent to the Unix-style (the part is the so-called drive letter). When make runs on these systems, it supports backslashes as well as the Unix-style forward slashes in pathnames. However, this support does not include the wildcard expansion, where backslash is a quote character. Therefore, you must use Unix-style slashes in these cases.\n\nWildcard expansion happens automatically in rules. But wildcard expansion does not normally take place when a variable is set, or inside the arguments of a function. If you want to do wildcard expansion in such places, you need to use the wildcard function, like this:\n\nThis string, used anywhere in a makefile, is replaced by a space-separated list of names of existing files that match one of the given file name patterns. If no existing file name matches a pattern, then that pattern is omitted from the output of the wildcard function. Note that this is different from how unmatched wildcards behave in rules, where they are used verbatim rather than ignored (see section Pitfalls of Using Wildcards).\n\nOne use of the wildcard function is to get a list of all the C source files in a directory, like this:\n\nWe can change the list of C source files into a list of object files by replacing the suffix with in the result, like this:\n\nThus, a makefile to compile all C source files in the directory and then link them together could be written as follows:\n\nFor large systems, it is often desirable to put sources in a separate directory from the binaries. The directory search features of make facilitate this by searching several directories automatically to find a prerequisite. When you redistribute the files among directories, you do not need to change the individual rules, just the search paths.\n\nThe value of the make variable VPATH specifies a list of directories that make should search. Most often, the directories are expected to contain prerequisite files that are not in the current directory; however, VPATH specifies a search list that make applies for all files, including files which are targets of rules.\n\nThus, if a file that is listed as a target or prerequisite does not exist in the current directory, make searches the directories listed in VPATH for a file with that name. If a file is found in one of them, that file may become the prerequisite (see below). Rules may then specify the names of files in the prerequisite list as if they all existed in the current directory. See section Writing Shell Commands with Directory Search.\n\nIn the VPATH variable, directory names are separated by colons or blanks. The order in which directories are listed is the order followed by make in its search. (On MS-DOS and MS-Windows, semi-colons are used as separators of directory names in VPATH, since the colon can be used in the pathname itself, after the drive letter.)\n\nspecifies a path containing two directories, and , which make searches in that order.\n\nWith this value of VPATH, the following rule,\n\nis interpreted as if it were written like this:\n\nassuming the file does not exist in the current directory but is found in the directory .\n\nSimilar to the VPATH variable, but more selective, is the vpath directive (note lower case), which allows you to specify a search path for a particular class of file names: those that match a particular pattern. Thus you can supply certain search directories for one class of file names and other directories (or none) for other file names.\n\nThere are three forms of the vpath directive:\n\nSpecify the search path directories for file names that match pattern. The search path, directories, is a list of directories to be searched, separated by colons (semi-colons on MS-DOS and MS-Windows) or blanks, just like the search path used in the VPATH variable.\n\nClear out the search path associated with pattern.\n\nClear all search paths previously specified with vpath directives.\n\nA vpath pattern is a string containing a character. The string must match the file name of a prerequisite that is being searched for, the character matching any sequence of zero or more characters (as in pattern rules; see section Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules). For example, %.h matches files that end in .h. (If there is no , the pattern must match the prerequisite exactly, which is not useful very often.)\n\ncharacters in a vpath directive’s pattern can be quoted with preceding backslashes ( \\`). Backslashes that would otherwise quote % characters can be quoted with more backslashes. Backslashes that quote % characters or other backslashes are removed from the pattern before it is compared to file names. Backslashes that are not in danger of quoting %` characters go unmolested.\n\nWhen a prerequisite fails to exist in the current directory, if the pattern in a vpath directive matches the name of the prerequisite file, then the directories in that directive are searched just like (and before) the directories in the VPATH variable.\n\ntells make to look for any prerequisite whose name ends in in the directory if the file is not found in the current directory.\n\nIf several vpath patterns match the prerequisite file’s name, then make processes each matching vpath directive one by one, searching all the directories mentioned in each directive. make handles multiple vpath directives in the order in which they appear in the makefile; multiple directives with the same pattern are independent of each other.\n\nwill look for a file ending in in , then , then , while\n\nwill look for a file ending in in , then , then .\n\nWhen a prerequisite is found through directory search, regardless of type (general or selective), the pathname located may not be the one that make actually provides you in the prerequisite list. Sometimes the path discovered through directory search is thrown away.\n\nThe algorithm make uses to decide whether to keep or abandon a path found via directory search is as follows:\n• If a target file does not exist at the path specified in the makefile, directory search is performed.\n• If the directory search is successful, that path is kept and this file is tentatively stored as the target.\n• All prerequisites of this target are examined using this same method.\n• After processing the prerequisites, the target may or may not need to be rebuilt:\n• If the target does not need to be rebuilt, the path to the file found during directory search is used for any prerequisite lists which contain this target. In short, if make doesn’t need to rebuild the target then you use the path found via directory search.\n• If the target does need to be rebuilt (is out-of-date), the pathname found during directory search is thrown away, and the target is rebuilt using the file name specified in the makefile. In short, if make must rebuild, then the target is rebuilt locally, not in the directory found via directory search.\n\nThis algorithm may seem complex, but in practice it is quite often exactly what you want.\n\nOther versions of make use a simpler algorithm: if the file does not exist, and it is found via directory search, then that pathname is always used whether or not the target needs to be built. Thus, if the target is rebuilt it is created at the pathname discovered during directory search.\n\nIf, in fact, this is the behavior you want for some or all of your directories, you can use the GPATH variable to indicate this to make.\n\nGPATH has the same syntax and format as VPATH (that is, a space- or colon-delimited list of pathnames). If an out-of-date target is found by directory search in a directory that also appears in GPATH, then that pathname is not thrown away. The target is rebuilt using the expanded path.\n\nWhen a prerequisite is found in another directory through directory search, this cannot change the commands of the rule; they will execute as written. Therefore, you must write the commands with care so that they will look for the prerequisite in the directory where make finds it.\n\nThis is done with the automatic variables such as (see section Automatic Variables). For instance, the value of is a list of all the prerequisites of the rule, including the names of the directories in which they were found, and the value of is the target. Thus:\n\nOften the prerequisites include header files as well, which you do not want to mention in the commands. The automatic variable is just the first prerequisite:\n\nThe search through the directories specified in VPATH or with vpath also happens during consideration of implicit rules (see section Using Implicit Rules).\n\nFor example, when a file has no explicit rule, make considers implicit rules, such as the built-in rule to compile if that file exists. If such a file is lacking in the current directory, the appropriate directories are searched for it. If exists (or is mentioned in the makefile) in any of the directories, the implicit rule for C compilation is applied.\n\nThe commands of implicit rules normally use automatic variables as a matter of necessity; consequently they will use the file names found by directory search with no extra effort.\n\nDirectory search applies in a special way to libraries used with the linker. This special feature comes into play when you write a prerequisite whose name is of the form . (You can tell something strange is going on here because the prerequisite is normally the name of a file, and the file name of a library generally looks like , not like .)\n\nWhen a prerequisite’s name has the form , make handles it specially by searching for the file in the current directory, in directories specified by matching vpath search paths and the VPATH search path, and then in the directories , , and (normally , but MS-DOS/MS-Windows versions of make behave as if prefix is defined to be the root of the DJGPP installation tree).\n\nIf that file is not found, then the file is searched for, in the same directories as above.\n\nFor example, if there is a library on your system (and no file), then\n\nwould cause the command to be executed when is older than or than .\n\nAlthough the default set of files to be searched for is and , this is customizable via the .LIBPATTERNS variable. Each word in the value of this variable is a pattern string. When a prerequisite like is seen, make will replace the percent in each pattern in the list with name and perform the above directory searches using that library filename. If no library is found, the next word in the list will be used.\n\nThe default value for .LIBPATTERNS is “ ”, which provides the default behavior described above.\n\nYou can turn off link library expansion completely by setting this variable to an empty value.\n\nA phony target is one that is not really the name of a file. It is just a name for some commands to be executed when you make an explicit request. There are two reasons to use a phony target: to avoid a conflict with a file of the same name, and to improve performance.\n\nIf you write a rule whose commands will not create the target file, the commands will be executed every time the target comes up for remaking. Here is an example:\n\nBecause the rm command does not create a file named , probably no such file will ever exist. Therefore, the rm command will be executed every time you say .\n\nThe phony target will cease to work if anything ever does create a file named in this directory. Since it has no prerequisites, the file would inevitably be considered up to date, and its commands would not be executed. To avoid this problem, you can explicitly declare the target to be phony, using the special target .PHONY (see section Special Built-in Target Names) as follows:\n\nOnce this is done, will run the commands regardless of whether there is a file named .\n\nSince it knows that phony targets do not name actual files that could be remade from other files, make skips the implicit rule search for phony targets (see section Using Implicit Rules). This is why declaring a target phony is good for performance, even if you are not worried about the actual file existing.\n\nThus, you first write the line that states that clean is a phony target, then you write the rule, like this:\n\nAnother example of the usefulness of phony targets is in conjunction with recursive invocations of make. In this case the makefile will often contain a variable which lists a number of subdirectories to be built. One way to handle this is with one rule whose command is a shell loop over the subdirectories, like this:\n\nSUBDIRS = foo bar baz subdirs: for dir in $(SUBDIRS); do \\ $(MAKE) -C $$dir; \\ done\n\nThere are a few of problems with this method, however. First, any error detected in a submake is not noted by this rule, so it will continue to build the rest of the directories even when one fails. This can be overcome by adding shell commands to note the error and exit, but then it will do so even if make is invoked with the -k option, which is unfortunate. Second, and perhaps more importantly, you cannot take advantage of the parallel build capabilities of make using this method, since there is only one rule.\n\nBy declaring the subdirectories as phony targets (you must do this as the subdirectory obviously always exists; otherwise it won’t be built) you can remove these problems:\n\nHere we’ve also declared that the subdirectory cannot be built until after the subdirectory is complete; this kind of relationship declaration is particularly important when attempting parallel builds.\n\nA phony target should not be a prerequisite of a real target file; if it is, its commands are run every time make goes to update that file. As long as a phony target is never a prerequisite of a real target, the phony target commands will be executed only when the phony target is a specified goal (see section Arguments to Specify the Goals).\n\nPhony targets can have prerequisites. When one directory contains multiple programs, it is most convenient to describe all of the programs in one makefile . Since the target remade by default will be the first one in the makefile, it is common to make this a phony target named and give it, as prerequisites, all the individual programs. For example:\n\nNow you can say just to remake all three programs, or specify as arguments the ones to remake (as in ).\n\nWhen one phony target is a prerequisite of another, it serves as a subroutine of the other. For example, here will delete the object files, the difference files, and the file :\n\n\n\n If a rule has no prerequisites or commands, and the target of the rule is a nonexistent file, then make imagines this target to have been updated whenever its rule is run. This implies that all targets depending on this one will always have their commands run.\n\n An example will illustrate this:\n\nHere the target satisfies the special conditions, so the target that depends on it is forced to run its commands. There is nothing special about the name , but that is one name commonly used this way.\n\n As you can see, using this way has the same results as using .\n\n Using is more explicit and more efficient. However, other versions of make do not support ; thus appears in many makefiles. See section Phony Targets.\n\n\n\n The empty target is a variant of the phony target; it is used to hold commands for an action that you request explicitly from time to time. Unlike a phony target, this target file can really exist; but the file’s contents do not matter, and usually are empty.\n\n The purpose of the empty target file is to record, with its last-modification time, when the rule’s commands were last executed. It does so because one of the commands is a touch command to update the target file.\n\n The empty target file should have some prerequisites (otherwise it doesn’t make sense). When you ask to remake the empty target, the commands are executed if any prerequisite is more recent than the target; in other words, if a prerequisite has changed since the last time you remade the target. Here is an example:\n\n\n\n With this rule, will execute the lpr command if either source file has changed since the last . The automatic variable is used to print only those files that have changed (see section Automatic Variables).\n\n\n\n Certain names have special meanings if they appear as targets.\n\nThe prerequisites of the special target .PHONY are considered to be phony targets. When it is time to consider such a target, make will run its commands unconditionally, regardless of whether a file with that name exists or what its last-modification time is. See section Phony Targets.\n\nThe prerequisites of the special target .SUFFIXES are the list of suffixes to be used in checking for suffix rules. See section Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules.\n\nThe commands specified for .DEFAULT are used for any target for which no rules are found (either explicit rules or implicit rules). See section Defining Last-Resort Default Rules. If .DEFAULT commands are specified, every file mentioned as a prerequisite, but not as a target in a rule, will have these commands executed on its behalf. See section Implicit Rule Search Algorithm.\n\nThe targets which .PRECIOUS depends on are given the following special treatment: if make is killed or interrupted during the execution of their commands, the target is not deleted. See section Interrupting or Killing make. Also, if the target is an intermediate file, it will not be deleted after it is no longer needed, as is normally done. See section Chains of Implicit Rules. In this latter respect it overlaps with the .SECONDARY special target. You can also list the target pattern of an implicit rule (such as ) as a prerequisite file of the special target .PRECIOUS to preserve intermediate files created by rules whose target patterns match that file’s name.\n\nThe targets which .INTERMEDIATE depends on are treated as intermediate files. See section Chains of Implicit Rules. .INTERMEDIATE with no prerequisites has no effect.\n\nThe targets which .SECONDARY depends on are treated as intermediate files, except that they are never automatically deleted. See section Chains of Implicit Rules. .SECONDARY with no prerequisites causes all targets to be treated as secondary (i.e., no target is removed because it is considered intermediate).\n\nIf .DELETE_ON_ERROR is mentioned as a target anywhere in the makefile, then make will delete the target of a rule if it has changed and its commands exit with a nonzero exit status, just as it does when it receives a signal. See section Errors in Commands.\n\nIf you specify prerequisites for .IGNORE, then make will ignore errors in execution of the commands run for those particular files. The commands for .IGNORE are not meaningful. If mentioned as a target with no prerequisites, .IGNORE says to ignore errors in execution of commands for all files. This usage of is supported only for historical compatibility. Since this affects every command in the makefile, it is not very useful; we recommend you use the more selective ways to ignore errors in specific commands. See section Errors in Commands.\n\nIf you specify prerequisites for .SILENT, then make will not print the commands to remake those particular files before executing them. The commands for .SILENT are not meaningful. If mentioned as a target with no prerequisites, .SILENT says not to print any commands before executing them. This usage of is supported only for historical compatibility. We recommend you use the more selective ways to silence specific commands. See section Command Echoing. If you want to silence all commands for a particular run of make, use the or option (see section Summary of Options).\n\nSimply by being mentioned as a target, this tells make to export all variables to child processes by default. See section Communicating Variables to a Sub-make.\n\nIf .NOTPARALLEL is mentioned as a target, then this invocation of make will be run serially, even if the option is given. Any recursively invoked make command will still be run in parallel (unless its makefile contains this target). Any prerequisites on this target are ignored.\n\nAny defined implicit rule suffix also counts as a special target if it appears as a target, and so does the concatenation of two suffixes, such as . These targets are suffix rules, an obsolete way of defining implicit rules (but a way still widely used). In principle, any target name could be special in this way if you break it in two and add both pieces to the suffix list. In practice, suffixes normally begin with , so these special target names also begin with . See section Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules.\n\n\n\n A rule with multiple targets is equivalent to writing many rules, each with one target, and all identical aside from that. The same commands apply to all the targets, but their effects may vary because you can substitute the actual target name into the command using . The rule contributes the same prerequisites to all the targets also.\n\n This is useful in two cases.\n• You want just prerequisites, no commands. For example:\n\ngives an additional prerequisite to each of the three object files mentioned.\n• Similar commands work for all the targets. The commands do not need to be absolutely identical, since the automatic variable can be used to substitute the particular target to be remade into the commands (see section Automatic Variables). For example:\n\nHere we assume the hypothetical program generate makes two types of output, one if given and one if given . See section Functions for String Substitution and Analysis, for an explanation of the subst function.\n\n Suppose you would like to vary the prerequisites according to the target, much as the variable allows you to vary the commands. You cannot do this with multiple targets in an ordinary rule, but you can do it with a static pattern rule. See section Static Pattern Rules.\n\nOne file can be the target of several rules. All the prerequisites mentioned in all the rules are merged into one list of prerequisites for the target. If the target is older than any prerequisite from any rule, the commands are executed.\n\n There can only be one set of commands to be executed for a file. If more than one rule gives commands for the same file, make uses the last set given and prints an error message. (As a special case, if the file’s name begins with a dot, no error message is printed. This odd behavior is only for compatibility with other implementations of make.) There is no reason to write your makefiles this way; that is why make gives you an error message.\n\n An extra rule with just prerequisites can be used to give a few extra prerequisites to many files at once. For example, one usually has a variable named objects containing a list of all the compiler output files in the system being made. An easy way to say that all of them must be recompiled if changes is to write the following:\n\nThis could be inserted or taken out without changing the rules that really specify how to make the object files, making it a convenient form to use if you wish to add the additional prerequisite intermittently.\n\n Another wrinkle is that the additional prerequisites could be specified with a variable that you set with a command argument to make (see section Overriding Variables). For example,\n\nmeans that the command will consider as a prerequisite of each object file, but plain will not.\n\n If none of the explicit rules for a target has commands, then make searches for an applicable implicit rule to find some commands see section Using Implicit Rules).\n\n\n\n Static pattern rules are rules which specify multiple targets and construct the prerequisite names for each target based on the target name. They are more general than ordinary rules with multiple targets because the targets do not have to have identical prerequisites. Their prerequisites must be analogous, but not necessarily identical.\n\n\n\n Here is the syntax of a static pattern rule:\n\nThe targets list specifies the targets that the rule applies to. The targets can contain wildcard characters, just like the targets of ordinary rules (see section Using Wildcard Characters in File Names).\n\n The target-pattern and dep-patterns say how to compute the prerequisites of each target. Each target is matched against the target-pattern to extract a part of the target name, called the stem. This stem is substituted into each of the dep-patterns to make the prerequisite names (one from each dep-pattern).\n\n Each pattern normally contains the character just once. When the target-pattern matches a target, the can match any part of the target name; this part is called the stem. The rest of the pattern must match exactly. For example, the target matches the pattern , with as the stem. The targets and do not match that pattern.\n\n The prerequisite names for each target are made by substituting the stem for the in each prerequisite pattern. For example, if one prerequisite pattern is , then substitution of the stem gives the prerequisite name . It is legitimate to write a prerequisite pattern that does not contain ; then this prerequisite is the same for all targets.\n\n characters in pattern rules can be quoted with preceding backslashes ( \\`). Backslashes that would otherwise quote % characters can be quoted with more backslashes. Backslashes that quote % characters or other backslashes are removed from the pattern before it is compared to file names or has a stem substituted into it. Backslashes that are not in danger of quoting % characters go unmolested. For example, the pattern the\\%weird\\\\%pattern\\` has % pattern\\` following it. The final two backslashes are left alone because they cannot affect any character.\n\n Here is an example, which compiles each of and from the corresponding file:\n\nobjects = foo.o bar.o all: $(objects) $(objects): %.o: %.c $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $< -o $@\n\nHere is the automatic variable that holds the name of the prerequisite and is the automatic variable that holds the name of the target; see section Automatic Variables.\n\n Each target specified must match the target pattern; a warning is issued for each target that does not. If you have a list of files, only some of which will match the pattern, you can use the filter function to remove nonmatching file names (see section Functions for String Substitution and Analysis):\n\nIn this example the result of is , and the first static pattern rule causes each of these object files to be updated by compiling the corresponding C source file. The result of is , so that file is made from .\n\n Another example shows how to use $* in static pattern rules:\n\nWhen the generate command is run, $* will expand to the stem, either or .\n\n\n\n A static pattern rule has much in common with an implicit rule defined as a pattern rule (see section Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules). Both have a pattern for the target and patterns for constructing the names of prerequisites. The difference is in how make decides when the rule applies.\n\n An implicit rule can apply to any target that matches its pattern, but it does apply only when the target has no commands otherwise specified, and only when the prerequisites can be found. If more than one implicit rule appears applicable, only one applies; the choice depends on the order of rules.\n\n By contrast, a static pattern rule applies to the precise list of targets that you specify in the rule. It cannot apply to any other target and it invariably does apply to each of the targets specified. If two conflicting rules apply, and both have commands, that’s an error.\n\n The static pattern rule can be better than an implicit rule for these reasons:\n• You may wish to override the usual implicit rule for a few files whose names cannot be categorized syntactically but can be given in an explicit list.\n• If you cannot be sure of the precise contents of the directories you are using, you may not be sure which other irrelevant files might lead make to use the wrong implicit rule. The choice might depend on the order in which the implicit rule search is done. With static pattern rules, there is no uncertainty: each rule applies to precisely the targets specified.\n\n\n\n Double-colon rules are rules written with instead of after the target names. They are handled differently from ordinary rules when the same target appears in more than one rule.\n\n When a target appears in multiple rules, all the rules must be the same type: all ordinary, or all double-colon. If they are double-colon, each of them is independent of the others. Each double-colon rule’s commands are executed if the target is older than any prerequisites of that rule. This can result in executing none, any, or all of the double-colon rules.\n\n Double-colon rules with the same target are in fact completely separate from one another. Each double-colon rule is processed individually, just as rules with different targets are processed.\n\n The double-colon rules for a target are executed in the order they appear in the makefile. However, the cases where double-colon rules really make sense are those where the order of executing the commands would not matter.\n\n Double-colon rules are somewhat obscure and not often very useful; they provide a mechanism for cases in which the method used to update a target differs depending on which prerequisite files caused the update, and such cases are rare.\n\n Each double-colon rule should specify commands; if it does not, an implicit rule will be used if one applies. See section Using Implicit Rules.\n\n\n\n In the makefile for a program, many of the rules you need to write often say only that some object file depends on some header file. For example, if uses via an #include, you would write:\n\nYou need this rule so that make knows that it must remake whenever changes. You can see that for a large program you would have to write dozens of such rules in your makefile. And, you must always be very careful to update the makefile every time you add or remove an #include. \n\n To avoid this hassle, most modern C compilers can write these rules for you, by looking at the #include lines in the source files. Usually this is done with the option to the compiler. For example, the command:\n\nThus you no longer have to write all those rules yourself. The compiler will do it for you.\n\n Note that such a prerequisite constitutes mentioning in a makefile, so it can never be considered an intermediate file by implicit rule search. This means that make won’t ever remove the file after using it; see section Chains of Implicit Rules.\n\n With old make programs, it was traditional practice to use this compiler feature to generate prerequisites on demand with a command like . That command would create a file containing all the automatically-generated prerequisites; then the makefile could use include to read them in (see section Including Other Makefiles).\n\n In GNU make, the feature of remaking makefiles makes this practice obsolete–you need never tell make explicitly to regenerate the prerequisites, because it always regenerates any makefile that is out of date. See section How Makefiles Are Remade.\n\n The practice we recommend for automatic prerequisite generation is to have one makefile corresponding to each source file. For each source file there is a makefile which lists what files the object file depends on. That way only the source files that have changed need to be rescanned to produce the new prerequisites.\n\n Here is the pattern rule to generate a file of prerequisites (i.e., a makefile) called from a C source file called :\n\nSee section Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules, for information on defining pattern rules. The flag to the shell makes it exit immediately if the $(CC) command fails (exits with a nonzero status). Normally the shell exits with the status of the last command in the pipeline (sed in this case), so make would not notice a nonzero status from the compiler. \n\n With the GNU C compiler, you may wish to use the flag instead of . This omits prerequisites on system header files. See section `Options Controlling the Preprocessor’ in Using GNU CC, for details.\n\n The purpose of the sed command is to translate (for example):\n\nThis makes each file depend on all the source and header files that the corresponding file depends on. make then knows it must regenerate the prerequisites whenever any of the source or header files changes.\n\n Once you’ve defined the rule to remake the files, you then use the include directive to read them all in. See section Including Other Makefiles. For example:\n\n(This example uses a substitution variable reference to translate the list of source files into a list of prerequisite makefiles, . See section Substitution References, for full information on substitution references.) Since the files are makefiles like any others, make will remake them as necessary with no further work from you. See section How Makefiles Are Remade.\n\n\n\n The commands of a rule consist of shell command lines to be executed one by one. Each command line must start with a tab, except that the first command line may be attached to the target-and-prerequisites line with a semicolon in between. Blank lines and lines of just comments may appear among the command lines; they are ignored. (But beware, an apparently “blank” line that begins with a tab is not blank! It is an empty command; see section Using Empty Commands.)\n\n Users use many different shell programs, but commands in makefiles are always interpreted by unless the makefile specifies otherwise. See section Command Execution.\n\n The shell that is in use determines whether comments can be written on command lines, and what syntax they use. When the shell is , a starts a comment that extends to the end of the line. The does not have to be at the beginning of a line. Text on a line before a is not part of the comment.\n\n\n\n Normally make prints each command line before it is executed. We call this echoing because it gives the appearance that you are typing the commands yourself.\n\n When a line starts with , the echoing of that line is suppressed. The is discarded before the command is passed to the shell. Typically you would use this for a command whose only effect is to print something, such as an echo command to indicate progress through the makefile:\n\nWhen make is given the flag or it only echoes commands, it won’t execute them. See section Summary of Options. In this case and only this case, even the commands starting with are printed. This flag is useful for finding out which commands make thinks are necessary without actually doing them.\n\n The or flag to make prevents all echoing, as if all commands started with . A rule in the makefile for the special target .SILENT without prerequisites has the same effect (see section Special Built-in Target Names). .SILENT is essentially obsolete since is more flexible.\n\n\n\n When it is time to execute commands to update a target, they are executed by making a new subshell for each line. (In practice, make may take shortcuts that do not affect the results.)\n\n Please note: this implies that shell commands such as cd that set variables local to each process will not affect the following command lines. (2)If you want to use cd to affect the next command, put the two on a single line with a semicolon between them. Then make will consider them a single command and pass them, together, to a shell which will execute them in sequence. For example:\n\nIf you would like to split a single shell command into multiple lines of text, you must use a backslash at the end of all but the last subline. Such a sequence of lines is combined into a single line, by deleting the backslash-newline sequences, before passing it to the shell. Thus, the following is equivalent to the preceding example:\n\nThe program used as the shell is taken from the variable SHELL. By default, the program is used.\n\n On MS-DOS, if SHELL is not set, the value of the variable COMSPEC (which is always set) is used instead.\n\n The processing of lines that set the variable SHELL in Makefiles is different on MS-DOS. The stock shell, , is ridiculously limited in its functionality and many users of make tend to install a replacement shell. Therefore, on MS-DOS, make examines the value of SHELL, and changes its behavior based on whether it points to a Unix-style or DOS-style shell. This allows reasonable functionality even if SHELL points to .\n\n If SHELL points to a Unix-style shell, make on MS-DOS additionally checks whether that shell can indeed be found; if not, it ignores the line that sets SHELL. In MS-DOS, GNU make searches for the shell in the following places:\n• In the precise place pointed to by the value of SHELL. For example, if the makefile specifies , make will look in the directory on the current drive.\n• In each of the directories in the PATH variable, in order.\n\nIn every directory it examines, make will first look for the specific file ( in the example above). If this is not found, it will also look in that directory for that file with one of the known extensions which identify executable files. For example , , , , , and some others.\n\n If any of these attempts is successful, the value of SHELL will be set to the full pathname of the shell as found. However, if none of these is found, the value of SHELL will not be changed, and thus the line that sets it will be effectively ignored. This is so make will only support features specific to a Unix-style shell if such a shell is actually installed on the system where make runs.\n\n Note that this extended search for the shell is limited to the cases where SHELL is set from the Makefile; if it is set in the environment or command line, you are expected to set it to the full pathname of the shell, exactly as things are on Unix.\n\n The effect of the above DOS-specific processing is that a Makefile that says (as many Unix makefiles do), will work on MS-DOS unaltered if you have e.g. installed in some directory along your PATH.\n\n Unlike most variables, the variable SHELL is never set from the environment. This is because the SHELL environment variable is used to specify your personal choice of shell program for interactive use. It would be very bad for personal choices like this to affect the functioning of makefiles. See section Variables from the Environment. However, on MS-DOS and MS-Windows the value of SHELL in the environment is used, since on those systems most users do not set this variable, and therefore it is most likely set specifically to be used by make. On MS-DOS, if the setting of SHELL is not suitable for make, you can set the variable MAKESHELL to the shell that make should use; this will override the value of SHELL.\n\n\n\n GNU make knows how to execute several commands at once. Normally, make will execute only one command at a time, waiting for it to finish before executing the next. However, the or option tells make to execute many commands simultaneously.\n\n On MS-DOS, the option has no effect, since that system doesn’t support multi-processing.\n\n If the option is followed by an integer, this is the number of commands to execute at once; this is called the number of job slots. If there is nothing looking like an integer after the option, there is no limit on the number of job slots. The default number of job slots is one, which means serial execution (one thing at a time).\n\n One unpleasant consequence of running several commands simultaneously is that output generated by the commands appears whenever each command sends it, so messages from different commands may be interspersed.\n\n Another problem is that two processes cannot both take input from the same device; so to make sure that only one command tries to take input from the terminal at once, make will invalidate the standard input streams of all but one running command. This means that attempting to read from standard input will usually be a fatal error (a signal) for most child processes if there are several. \n\n It is unpredictable which command will have a valid standard input stream (which will come from the terminal, or wherever you redirect the standard input of make). The first command run will always get it first, and the first command started after that one finishes will get it next, and so on.\n\n We will change how this aspect of make works if we find a better alternative. In the mean time, you should not rely on any command using standard input at all if you are using the parallel execution feature; but if you are not using this feature, then standard input works normally in all commands.\n\n Finally, handling recursive make invocations raises issues. For more information on this, see section Communicating Options to a Sub-make.\n\n If a command fails (is killed by a signal or exits with a nonzero status), and errors are not ignored for that command (see section Errors in Commands), the remaining command lines to remake the same target will not be run. If a command fails and the or option was not given (see section Summary of Options), make aborts execution. If make terminates for any reason (including a signal) with child processes running, it waits for them to finish before actually exiting.\n\n When the system is heavily loaded, you will probably want to run fewer jobs than when it is lightly loaded. You can use the option to tell make to limit the number of jobs to run at once, based on the load average. The or option is followed by a floating-point number. For example,\n\nwill not let make start more than one job if the load average is above 2.5. The option with no following number removes the load limit, if one was given with a previous option.\n\n More precisely, when make goes to start up a job, and it already has at least one job running, it checks the current load average; if it is not lower than the limit given with , make waits until the load average goes below that limit, or until all the other jobs finish.\n\n By default, there is no load limit.\n\n\n\n After each shell command returns, make looks at its exit status. If the command completed successfully, the next command line is executed in a new shell; after the last command line is finished, the rule is finished.\n\n If there is an error (the exit status is nonzero), make gives up on the current rule, and perhaps on all rules.\n\n Sometimes the failure of a certain command does not indicate a problem. For example, you may use the mkdir command to ensure that a directory exists. If the directory already exists, mkdir will report an error, but you probably want make to continue regardless.\n\n To ignore errors in a command line, write a at the beginning of the line’s text (after the initial tab). The is discarded before the command is passed to the shell for execution.\n\n For example,\n\n\n\n This causes rm to continue even if it is unable to remove a file.\n\n When you run make with the or flag, errors are ignored in all commands of all rules. A rule in the makefile for the special target .IGNORE has the same effect, if there are no prerequisites. These ways of ignoring errors are obsolete because is more flexible.\n\n When errors are to be ignored, because of either a or the flag, make treats an error return just like success, except that it prints out a message that tells you the status code the command exited with, and says that the error has been ignored.\n\n When an error happens that make has not been told to ignore, it implies that the current target cannot be correctly remade, and neither can any other that depends on it either directly or indirectly. No further commands will be executed for these targets, since their preconditions have not been achieved.\n\n Normally make gives up immediately in this circumstance, returning a nonzero status. However, if the or flag is specified, make continues to consider the other prerequisites of the pending targets, remaking them if necessary, before it gives up and returns nonzero status. For example, after an error in compiling one object file, will continue compiling other object files even though it already knows that linking them will be impossible. See section Summary of Options.\n\n The usual behavior assumes that your purpose is to get the specified targets up to date; once make learns that this is impossible, it might as well report the failure immediately. The option says that the real purpose is to test as many of the changes made in the program as possible, perhaps to find several independent problems so that you can correct them all before the next attempt to compile. This is why Emacs’ compile command passes the flag by default. \n\n Usually when a command fails, if it has changed the target file at all, the file is corrupted and cannot be used–or at least it is not completely updated. Yet the file’s timestamp says that it is now up to date, so the next time make runs, it will not try to update that file. The situation is just the same as when the command is killed by a signal; see section Interrupting or Killing make. So generally the right thing to do is to delete the target file if the command fails after beginning to change the file. make will do this if .DELETE_ON_ERROR appears as a target. This is almost always what you want make to do, but it is not historical practice; so for compatibility, you must explicitly request it.\n\nIf make gets a fatal signal while a command is executing, it may delete the target file that the command was supposed to update. This is done if the target file’s last-modification time has changed since make first checked it.\n\n The purpose of deleting the target is to make sure that it is remade from scratch when make is next run. Why is this? Suppose you type while a compiler is running, and it has begun to write an object file . The kills the compiler, resulting in an incomplete file whose last-modification time is newer than the source file . But make also receives the signal and deletes this incomplete file. If make did not do this, the next invocation of make would think that did not require updating–resulting in a strange error message from the linker when it tries to link an object file half of which is missing.\n\n You can prevent the deletion of a target file in this way by making the special target .PRECIOUS depend on it. Before remaking a target, make checks to see whether it appears on the prerequisites of .PRECIOUS, and thereby decides whether the target should be deleted if a signal happens. Some reasons why you might do this are that the target is updated in some atomic fashion, or exists only to record a modification-time (its contents do not matter), or must exist at all times to prevent other sorts of trouble.\n\n\n\n Recursive use of make means using make as a command in a makefile. This technique is useful when you want separate makefiles for various subsystems that compose a larger system. For example, suppose you have a subdirectory which has its own makefile, and you would like the containing directory’s makefile to run make on the subdirectory. You can do it by writing this:\n\nor, equivalently, this (see section Summary of Options):\n\n\n\n You can write recursive make commands just by copying this example, but there are many things to know about how they work and why, and about how the sub-make relates to the top-level make.\n\n For your convenience, GNU make sets the variable CURDIR to the pathname of the current working directory for you. If -C is in effect, it will contain the path of the new directory, not the original. The value has the same precedence it would have if it were set in the makefile (by default, an environment variable CURDIR will not override this value). Note that setting this variable has no effect on the operation of make\n\n\n\n Recursive make commands should always use the variable MAKE, not the explicit command name , as shown here:\n\nThe value of this variable is the file name with which make was invoked. If this file name was , then the command executed is . If you use a special version of make to run the top-level makefile, the same special version will be executed for recursive invocations. \n\n As a special feature, using the variable MAKE in the commands of a rule alters the effects of the ( ), ( ), or ( ) option. Using the MAKE variable has the same effect as using a character at the beginning of the command line. See section Instead of Executing the Commands.\n\n Consider the command in the above example. (The option marks targets as up to date without actually running any commands; see section Instead of Executing the Commands.) Following the usual definition of , a command in the example would create a file named and do nothing else. What you really want it to do is run ; but that would require executing the command, and says not to execute commands. \n\n The special feature makes this do what you want: whenever a command line of a rule contains the variable MAKE, the flags , and do not apply to that line. Command lines containing MAKE are executed normally despite the presence of a flag that causes most commands not to be run. The usual MAKEFLAGS mechanism passes the flags to the sub-make (see section Communicating Options to a Sub-make), so your request to touch the files, or print the commands, is propagated to the subsystem.\n\n\n\n Variable values of the top-level make can be passed to the sub-make through the environment by explicit request. These variables are defined in the sub-make as defaults, but do not override what is specified in the makefile used by the sub-make makefile unless you use the switch (see section Summary of Options).\n\n To pass down, or export, a variable, make adds the variable and its value to the environment for running each command. The sub-make, in turn, uses the environment to initialize its table of variable values. See section Variables from the Environment.\n\n Except by explicit request, make exports a variable only if it is either defined in the environment initially or set on the command line, and if its name consists only of letters, numbers, and underscores. Some shells cannot cope with environment variable names consisting of characters other than letters, numbers, and underscores.\n\n The special variables SHELL and MAKEFLAGS are always exported (unless you unexport them). MAKEFILES is exported if you set it to anything.\n\n make automatically passes down variable values that were defined on the command line, by putting them in the MAKEFLAGS variable. See the next section.\n\n Variables are not normally passed down if they were created by default by make (see section Variables Used by Implicit Rules). The sub-make will define these for itself.\n\n If you want to export specific variables to a sub-make, use the export directive, like this:\n\nIf you want to prevent a variable from being exported, use the unexport directive, like this:\n\nAs a convenience, you can define a variable and export it at the same time by doing:\n\nhas the same result as:\n\nhas the same result as:\n\nis just like:\n\nSee section Appending More Text to Variables.\n\n You may notice that the export and unexport directives work in make in the same way they work in the shell, sh.\n\n If you want all variables to be exported by default, you can use export by itself:\n\nThis tells make that variables which are not explicitly mentioned in an export or unexport directive should be exported. Any variable given in an unexport directive will still not be exported. If you use export by itself to export variables by default, variables whose names contain characters other than alphanumerics and underscores will not be exported unless specifically mentioned in an export directive.\n\n The behavior elicited by an export directive by itself was the default in older versions of GNU make. If your makefiles depend on this behavior and you want to be compatible with old versions of make, you can write a rule for the special target .EXPORT_ALL_VARIABLES instead of using the export directive. This will be ignored by old makes, while the export directive will cause a syntax error. \n\n Likewise, you can use unexport by itself to tell make not to export variables by default. Since this is the default behavior, you would only need to do this if export had been used by itself earlier (in an included makefile, perhaps). You cannot use export and unexport by themselves to have variables exported for some commands and not for others. The last export or unexport directive that appears by itself determines the behavior for the entire run of make.\n\n As a special feature, the variable MAKELEVEL is changed when it is passed down from level to level. This variable’s value is a string which is the depth of the level as a decimal number. The value is for the top-level make; for a sub-make, for a sub-sub-make, and so on. The incrementation happens when make sets up the environment for a command.\n\n The main use of MAKELEVEL is to test it in a conditional directive (see section Conditional Parts of Makefiles); this way you can write a makefile that behaves one way if run recursively and another way if run directly by you.\n\n You can use the variable MAKEFILES to cause all sub-make commands to use additional makefiles. The value of MAKEFILES is a whitespace-separated list of file names. This variable, if defined in the outer-level makefile, is passed down through the environment; then it serves as a list of extra makefiles for the sub-make to read before the usual or specified ones. See section The Variable MAKEFILES.\n\n\n\n Flags such as and are passed automatically to the sub-make through the variable MAKEFLAGS. This variable is set up automatically by make to contain the flag letters that make received. Thus, if you do then MAKEFLAGS gets the value .\n\n As a consequence, every sub-make gets a value for MAKEFLAGS in its environment. In response, it takes the flags from that value and processes them as if they had been given as arguments. See section Summary of Options.\n\n Likewise variables defined on the command line are passed to the sub-make through MAKEFLAGS. Words in the value of MAKEFLAGS that contain , make treats as variable definitions just as if they appeared on the command line. See section Overriding Variables.\n\n The options , , , and are not put into MAKEFLAGS; these options are not passed down.\n\n The option is a special case (see section Parallel Execution). If you set it to some numeric value and your operating system supports it (most any UNIX system will; others typically won’t), the parent make and all the sub-makes will communicate to ensure that there are only jobs running at the same time between them all. Note that any job that is marked recursive (see section Instead of Executing the Commands) doesn’t count against the total jobs (otherwise we could get sub-makes running and have no slots left over for any real work!)\n\n If your operating system doesn’t support the above communication, then is always put into MAKEFLAGS instead of the value you specified. This is because if the option were passed down to sub-makes, you would get many more jobs running in parallel than you asked for. If you give with no numeric argument, meaning to run as many jobs as possible in parallel, this is passed down, since multiple infinities are no more than one.\n\n If you do not want to pass the other flags down, you must change the value of MAKEFLAGS, like this:\n\nThe command line variable definitions really appear in the variable MAKEOVERRIDES, and MAKEFLAGS contains a reference to this variable. If you do want to pass flags down normally, but don’t want to pass down the command line variable definitions, you can reset MAKEOVERRIDES to empty, like this:\n\nThis is not usually useful to do. However, some systems have a small fixed limit on the size of the environment, and putting so much information into the value of MAKEFLAGS can exceed it. If you see the error message , this may be the problem. (For strict compliance with POSIX.2, changing MAKEOVERRIDES does not affect MAKEFLAGS if the special target appears in the makefile. You probably do not care about this.)\n\n A similar variable MFLAGS exists also, for historical compatibility. It has the same value as MAKEFLAGS except that it does not contain the command line variable definitions, and it always begins with a hyphen unless it is empty (MAKEFLAGS begins with a hyphen only when it begins with an option that has no single-letter version, such as ). MFLAGS was traditionally used explicitly in the recursive make command, like this:\n\nbut now MAKEFLAGS makes this usage redundant. If you want your makefiles to be compatible with old make programs, use this technique; it will work fine with more modern make versions too.\n\n The MAKEFLAGS variable can also be useful if you want to have certain options, such as (see section Summary of Options), set each time you run make. You simply put a value for MAKEFLAGS in your environment. You can also set MAKEFLAGS in a makefile, to specify additional flags that should also be in effect for that makefile. (Note that you cannot use MFLAGS this way. That variable is set only for compatibility; make does not interpret a value you set for it in any way.)\n\n When make interprets the value of MAKEFLAGS (either from the environment or from a makefile), it first prepends a hyphen if the value does not already begin with one. Then it chops the value into words separated by blanks, and parses these words as if they were options given on the command line (except that , , , , , and their long-named versions are ignored; and there is no error for an invalid option).\n\n If you do put MAKEFLAGS in your environment, you should be sure not to include any options that will drastically affect the actions of make and undermine the purpose of makefiles and of make itself. For instance, the , , and options, if put in one of these variables, could have disastrous consequences and would certainly have at least surprising and probably annoying effects.\n\n\n\n If you use several levels of recursive make invocations, the or option can make the output a lot easier to understand by showing each directory as make starts processing it and as make finishes processing it. For example, if is run in the directory , make will print a line of the form:\n\nbefore doing anything else, and a line of the form:\n\nNormally, you do not need to specify this option because does it for you: is turned on automatically when you use the option, and in sub-makes. make will not automatically turn on if you also use , which says to be silent, or if you use to explicitly disable it.\n\nWhen the same sequence of commands is useful in making various targets, you can define it as a canned sequence with the define directive, and refer to the canned sequence from the rules for those targets. The canned sequence is actually a variable, so the name must not conflict with other variable names.\n\nHere is an example of defining a canned sequence of commands:\n\nHere run-yacc is the name of the variable being defined; endef marks the end of the definition; the lines in between are the commands. The define directive does not expand variable references and function calls in the canned sequence; the characters, parentheses, variable names, and so on, all become part of the value of the variable you are defining. See section Defining Variables Verbatim, for a complete explanation of define.\n\nThe first command in this example runs Yacc on the first prerequisite of whichever rule uses the canned sequence. The output file from Yacc is always named . The second command moves the output to the rule’s target file name.\n\nTo use the canned sequence, substitute the variable into the commands of a rule. You can substitute it like any other variable (see section Basics of Variable References). Because variables defined by define are recursively expanded variables, all the variable references you wrote inside the define are expanded now. For example:\n\nwill be substituted for the variable when it occurs in run-yacc’s value, and for .\n\nThis is a realistic example, but this particular one is not needed in practice because make has an implicit rule to figure out these commands based on the file names involved (see section Using Implicit Rules).\n\nIn command execution, each line of a canned sequence is treated just as if the line appeared on its own in the rule, preceded by a tab. In particular, make invokes a separate subshell for each line. You can use the special prefix characters that affect command lines ( , , and ) on each line of a canned sequence. See section Writing the Commands in Rules. For example, using this canned sequence:\n\nmake will not echo the first line, the echo command. But it will echo the following two command lines.\n\nOn the other hand, prefix characters on the command line that refers to a canned sequence apply to every line in the sequence. So the rule:\n\ndoes not echo any commands. (See section Command Echoing, for a full explanation of .)\n\nIt is sometimes useful to define commands which do nothing. This is done simply by giving a command that consists of nothing but whitespace. For example:\n\ndefines an empty command string for . You could also use a line beginning with a tab character to define an empty command string, but this would be confusing because such a line looks empty.\n\nYou may be wondering why you would want to define a command string that does nothing. The only reason this is useful is to prevent a target from getting implicit commands (from implicit rules or the .DEFAULT special target; see section Using Implicit Rulesand see section Defining Last-Resort Default Rules).\n\nYou may be inclined to define empty command strings for targets that are not actual files, but only exist so that their prerequisites can be remade. However, this is not the best way to do that, because the prerequisites may not be remade properly if the target file actually does exist. See section Phony Targets, for a better way to do this.\n\nHow to Use Variables\n\nA variable is a name defined in a makefile to represent a string of text, called the variable’s value. These values are substituted by explicit request into targets, prerequisites, commands, and other parts of the makefile. (In some other versions of make, variables are called macros.)\n\nVariables and functions in all parts of a makefile are expanded when read, except for the shell commands in rules, the right-hand sides of variable definitions using , and the bodies of variable definitions using the define directive.\n\nVariables can represent lists of file names, options to pass to compilers, programs to run, directories to look in for source files, directories to write output in, or anything else you can imagine.\n\nA variable name may be any sequence of characters not containing , , , or leading or trailing whitespace. However, variable names containing characters other than letters, numbers, and underscores should be avoided, as they may be given special meanings in the future, and with some shells they cannot be passed through the environment to a sub-make (see section Communicating Variables to a Sub-make).\n\nVariable names are case-sensitive. The names , , and all refer to different variables.\n\nIt is traditional to use upper case letters in variable names, but we recommend using lower case letters for variable names that serve internal purposes in the makefile, and reserving upper case for parameters that control implicit rules or for parameters that the user should override with command options (see section Overriding Variables).\n\nA few variables have names that are a single punctuation character or just a few characters. These are the automatic variables, and they have particular specialized uses. See section Automatic Variables.\n\nTo substitute a variable’s value, write a dollar sign followed by the name of the variable in parentheses or braces: either or is a valid reference to the variable foo. This special significance of is why you must write to have the effect of a single dollar sign in a file name or command.\n\nVariable references can be used in any context: targets, prerequisites, commands, most directives, and new variable values. Here is an example of a common case, where a variable holds the names of all the object files in a program:\n\nVariable references work by strict textual substitution. Thus, the rule\n\ncould be used to compile a C program . Since spaces before the variable value are ignored in variable assignments, the value of foo is precisely . (Don’t actually write your makefiles this way!)\n\nA dollar sign followed by a character other than a dollar sign, open-parenthesis or open-brace treats that single character as the variable name. Thus, you could reference the variable x with . However, this practice is strongly discouraged, except in the case of the automatic variables (see section Automatic Variables).\n\nThe Two Flavors of Variables\n\nThere are two ways that a variable in GNU make can have a value; we call them the two flavors of variables. The two flavors are distinguished in how they are defined and in what they do when expanded.\n\nThe first flavor of variable is a recursively expanded variable. Variables of this sort are defined by lines using (see section Setting Variables) or by the define directive (see section Defining Variables Verbatim). The value you specify is installed verbatim; if it contains references to other variables, these references are expanded whenever this variable is substituted (in the course of expanding some other string). When this happens, it is called recursive expansion.\n\nwill echo : expands to which expands to which finally expands to .\n\nThis flavor of variable is the only sort supported by other versions of make. It has its advantages and its disadvantages. An advantage (most would say) is that:\n\nwill do what was intended: when is expanded in a command, it will expand to . A major disadvantage is that you cannot append something on the end of a variable, as in\n\nbecause it will cause an infinite loop in the variable expansion. (Actually make detects the infinite loop and reports an error.)\n\nAnother disadvantage is that any functions (see section Functions for Transforming Text) referenced in the definition will be executed every time the variable is expanded. This makes make run slower; worse, it causes the wildcard and shell functions to give unpredictable results because you cannot easily control when they are called, or even how many times.\n\nTo avoid all the problems and inconveniences of recursively expanded variables, there is another flavor: simply expanded variables.\n\nSimply expanded variables are defined by lines using (see section Setting Variables). The value of a simply expanded variable is scanned once and for all, expanding any references to other variables and functions, when the variable is defined. The actual value of the simply expanded variable is the result of expanding the text that you write. It does not contain any references to other variables; it contains their values as of the time this variable was defined. Therefore,\n\nWhen a simply expanded variable is referenced, its value is substituted verbatim.\n\nHere is a somewhat more complicated example, illustrating the use of in conjunction with the shell function. (See section The shell Function.) This example also shows use of the variable MAKELEVEL, which is changed when it is passed down from level to level. (See section Communicating Variables to a Sub-make, for information about MAKELEVEL.)\n\nAn advantage of this use of is that a typical `descend into a directory’ command then looks like this:\n\nSimply expanded variables generally make complicated makefile programming more predictable because they work like variables in most programming languages. They allow you to redefine a variable using its own value (or its value processed in some way by one of the expansion functions) and to use the expansion functions much more efficiently (see section Functions for Transforming Text).\n\nYou can also use them to introduce controlled leading whitespace into variable values. Leading whitespace characters are discarded from your input before substitution of variable references and function calls; this means you can include leading spaces in a variable value by protecting them with variable references, like this:\n\nHere the value of the variable space is precisely one space. The comment is included here just for clarity. Since trailing space characters are not stripped from variable values, just a space at the end of the line would have the same effect (but be rather hard to read). If you put whitespace at the end of a variable value, it is a good idea to put a comment like that at the end of the line to make your intent clear. Conversely, if you do not want any whitespace characters at the end of your variable value, you must remember not to put a random comment on the end of the line after some whitespace, such as this:\n\ndir := /foo/bar # directory to put the frobs in\n\nHere the value of the variable dir is (with four trailing spaces), which was probably not the intention. (Imagine something like with this definition!)\n\nThere is another assignment operator for variables, . This is called a conditional variable assignment operator, because it only has an effect if the variable is not yet defined. This statement:\n\nis exactly equivalent to this (see section The origin Function):\n\nNote that a variable set to an empty value is still defined, so will not set that variable.\n\nThis section describes some advanced features you can use to reference variables in more flexible ways.\n\nA substitution reference substitutes the value of a variable with alterations that you specify. It has the form (or ) and its meaning is to take the value of the variable var, replace every a at the end of a word with b in that value, and substitute the resulting string.\n\nWhen we say “at the end of a word”, we mean that a must appear either followed by whitespace or at the end of the value in order to be replaced; other occurrences of a in the value are unaltered. For example:\n\nA substitution reference is actually an abbreviation for use of the patsubst expansion function (see section Functions for String Substitution and Analysis). We provide substitution references as well as patsubst for compatibility with other implementations of make.\n\nAnother type of substitution reference lets you use the full power of the patsubst function. It has the same form described above, except that now a must contain a single character. This case is equivalent to . See section Functions for String Substitution and Analysis, for a description of the patsubst function.\n\nComputed variable names are a complicated concept needed only for sophisticated makefile programming. For most purposes you need not consider them, except to know that making a variable with a dollar sign in its name might have strange results. However, if you are the type that wants to understand everything, or you are actually interested in what they do, read on.\n\nVariables may be referenced inside the name of a variable. This is called a computed variable name or a nested variable reference. For example,\n\ndefines a as : the inside expands to , so expands to which in turn expands to . Here the name of the variable to reference is not stated explicitly; it is computed by expansion of . The reference here is nested within the outer variable reference.\n\nThe previous example shows two levels of nesting, but any number of levels is possible. For example, here are three levels:\n\nHere the innermost expands to , so expands to which in turn expands to ; now we have , which becomes .\n\nReferences to recursively-expanded variables within a variable name are reexpanded in the usual fashion. For example:\n\ndefines a as : becomes which becomes which becomes .\n\nNested variable references can also contain modified references and function invocations (see section Functions for Transforming Text), just like any other reference. For example, using the subst function (see section Functions for String Substitution and Analysis):\n\neventually defines a as . It is doubtful that anyone would ever want to write a nested reference as convoluted as this one, but it works: expands to which becomes . This gets the value from x and changes it by substitution to , so that the entire string becomes , a simple variable reference whose value is .\n\nA computed variable name need not consist entirely of a single variable reference. It can contain several variable references, as well as some invariant text. For example,\n\nwill give dirs the same value as a_dirs, 1_dirs, a_files or 1_files depending on the settings of use_a and use_dirs.\n\nComputed variable names can also be used in substitution references:\n\ndefines sources as either or , depending on the value of a1.\n\nThe only restriction on this sort of use of nested variable references is that they cannot specify part of the name of a function to be called. This is because the test for a recognized function name is done before the expansion of nested references. For example,\n\nattempts to give the value of the variable or , rather than giving as the argument to either the sort or the strip function. This restriction could be removed in the future if that change is shown to be a good idea.\n\nYou can also use computed variable names in the left-hand side of a variable assignment, or in a define directive, as in:\n\nThis example defines the variables , , and .\n\nNote that nested variable references are quite different from recursively expanded variables (see section The Two Flavors of Variables), though both are used together in complex ways when doing makefile programming.\n\nHow Variables Get Their Values\n\nVariables can get values in several different ways:\n• You can specify an overriding value when you run make. See section Overriding Variables.\n• You can specify a value in the makefile, either with an assignment (see section Setting Variables) or with a verbatim definition (see section Defining Variables Verbatim).\n• Variables in the environment become make variables. See section Variables from the Environment.\n• Several automatic variables are given new values for each rule. Each of these has a single conventional use. See section Automatic Variables.\n• Several variables have constant initial values. See section Variables Used by Implicit Rules.\n\nTo set a variable from the makefile, write a line starting with the variable name followed by or . Whatever follows the or on the line becomes the value. For example,\n\ndefines a variable named objects. Whitespace around the variable name and immediately after the is ignored.\n\nVariables defined with are recursively expanded variables. Variables defined with are simply expanded variables; these definitions can contain variable references which will be expanded before the definition is made. See section The Two Flavors of Variables.\n\nThe variable name may contain function and variable references, which are expanded when the line is read to find the actual variable name to use.\n\nThere is no limit on the length of the value of a variable except the amount of swapping space on the computer. When a variable definition is long, it is a good idea to break it into several lines by inserting backslash-newline at convenient places in the definition. This will not affect the functioning of make, but it will make the makefile easier to read.\n\nMost variable names are considered to have the empty string as a value if you have never set them. Several variables have built-in initial values that are not empty, but you can set them in the usual ways (see section Variables Used by Implicit Rules). Several special variables are set automatically to a new value for each rule; these are called the automatic variables (see section Automatic Variables).\n\nIf you’d like a variable to be set to a value only if it’s not already set, then you can use the shorthand operator instead of . These two settings of the variable are identical (see section The origin Function):\n\nOften it is useful to add more text to the value of a variable already defined. You do this with a line containing , like this:\n\nThis takes the value of the variable objects, and adds the text to it (preceded by a single space). Thus:\n\nUsing is similar to:\n\nbut differs in ways that become important when you use more complex values.\n\nWhen the variable in question has not been defined before, acts just like normal : it defines a recursively-expanded variable. However, when there is a previous definition, exactly what does depends on what flavor of variable you defined originally. See section The Two Flavors of Variables, for an explanation of the two flavors of variables.\n\nWhen you add to a variable’s value with , make acts essentially as if you had included the extra text in the initial definition of the variable. If you defined it first with , making it a simply-expanded variable, adds to that simply-expanded definition, and expands the new text before appending it to the old value just as does (see section Setting Variables, for a full explanation of ). In fact,\n\nis exactly equivalent to:\n\nOn the other hand, when you use with a variable that you defined first to be recursively-expanded using plain , make does something a bit different. Recall that when you define a recursively-expanded variable, make does not expand the value you set for variable and function references immediately. Instead it stores the text verbatim, and saves these variable and function references to be expanded later, when you refer to the new variable (see section The Two Flavors of Variables). When you use on a recursively-expanded variable, it is this unexpanded text to which make appends the new text you specify.\n\nexcept that of course it never defines a variable called temp. The importance of this comes when the variable’s old value contains variable references. Take this common example:\n\nThe first line defines the CFLAGS variable with a reference to another variable, includes. (CFLAGS is used by the rules for C compilation; see section Catalogue of Implicit Rules.) Using for the definition makes CFLAGS a recursively-expanded variable, meaning is not expanded when make processes the definition of CFLAGS. Thus, includes need not be defined yet for its value to take effect. It only has to be defined before any reference to CFLAGS. If we tried to append to the value of CFLAGS without using , we might do it like this:\n\nThis is pretty close, but not quite what we want. Using redefines CFLAGS as a simply-expanded variable; this means make expands the text before setting the variable. If includes is not yet defined, we get , and a later definition of includes will have no effect. Conversely, by using we set CFLAGS to the unexpanded value . Thus we preserve the reference to includes, so if that variable gets defined at any later point, a reference like still uses its value.\n\nIf a variable has been set with a command argument (see section Overriding Variables), then ordinary assignments in the makefile are ignored. If you want to set the variable in the makefile even though it was set with a command argument, you can use an override directive, which is a line that looks like this:\n\nTo append more text to a variable defined on the command line, use:\n\nSee section Appending More Text to Variables.\n\nThe override directive was not invented for escalation in the war between makefiles and command arguments. It was invented so you can alter and add to values that the user specifies with command arguments.\n\nFor example, suppose you always want the switch when you run the C compiler, but you would like to allow the user to specify the other switches with a command argument just as usual. You could use this override directive:\n\nYou can also use override directives with define directives. This is done as you might expect:\n\nSee the next section for information about define.\n\nAnother way to set the value of a variable is to use the define directive. This directive has an unusual syntax which allows newline characters to be included in the value, which is convenient for defining canned sequences of commands (see section Defining Canned Command Sequences).\n\nThe define directive is followed on the same line by the name of the variable and nothing more. The value to give the variable appears on the following lines. The end of the value is marked by a line containing just the word endef. Aside from this difference in syntax, define works just like : it creates a recursively-expanded variable (see section The Two Flavors of Variables). The variable name may contain function and variable references, which are expanded when the directive is read to find the actual variable name to use.\n\nThe value in an ordinary assignment cannot contain a newline; but the newlines that separate the lines of the value in a define become part of the variable’s value (except for the final newline which precedes the endef and is not considered part of the value).\n\nThe previous example is functionally equivalent to this:\n\nsince two commands separated by semicolon behave much like two separate shell commands. However, note that using two separate lines means make will invoke the shell twice, running an independent subshell for each line. See section Command Execution.\n\nIf you want variable definitions made with define to take precedence over command-line variable definitions, you can use the override directive together with define:\n\nVariables in make can come from the environment in which make is run. Every environment variable that make sees when it starts up is transformed into a make variable with the same name and value. But an explicit assignment in the makefile, or with a command argument, overrides the environment. (If the flag is specified, then values from the environment override assignments in the makefile. See section Summary of Options. But this is not recommended practice.)\n\nThus, by setting the variable CFLAGS in your environment, you can cause all C compilations in most makefiles to use the compiler switches you prefer. This is safe for variables with standard or conventional meanings because you know that no makefile will use them for other things. (But this is not totally reliable; some makefiles set CFLAGS explicitly and therefore are not affected by the value in the environment.)\n\nWhen make is invoked recursively, variables defined in the outer invocation can be passed to inner invocations through the environment (see section Recursive Use of make). By default, only variables that came from the environment or the command line are passed to recursive invocations. You can use the export directive to pass other variables. See section Communicating Variables to a Sub-make, for full details.\n\nOther use of variables from the environment is not recommended. It is not wise for makefiles to depend for their functioning on environment variables set up outside their control, since this would cause different users to get different results from the same makefile. This is against the whole purpose of most makefiles.\n\nSuch problems would be especially likely with the variable SHELL, which is normally present in the environment to specify the user’s choice of interactive shell. It would be very undesirable for this choice to affect make. So make ignores the environment value of SHELL (except on MS-DOS and MS-Windows, where SHELL is usually not set. See section Command Execution.)\n\nVariable values in make are usually global; that is, they are the same regardless of where they are evaluated (unless they’re reset, of course). One exception to that is automatic variables (see section Automatic Variables).\n\nThe other exception is target-specific variable values. This feature allows you to define different values for the same variable, based on the target that make is currently building. As with automatic variables, these values are only available within the context of a target’s command script (and in other target-specific assignments).\n\nSet a target-specific variable value like this:\n\nor like this:\n\nMultiple target values create a target-specific variable value for each member of the target list individually.\n\nThe variable-assignment can be any valid form of assignment; recursive ( ), static ( ), appending ( ), or conditional ( ). All variables that appear within the variable-assignment are evaluated within the context of the target: thus, any previously-defined target-specific variable values will be in effect. Note that this variable is actually distinct from any “global” value: the two variables do not have to have the same flavor (recursive vs. static).\n\nTarget-specific variables have the same priority as any other makefile variable. Variables provided on the command-line (and in the environment if the option is in force) will take precedence. Specifying the override directive will allow the target-specific variable value to be preferred.\n\nThere is one more special feature of target-specific variables: when you define a target-specific variable, that variable value is also in effect for all prerequisites of this target (unless those prerequisites override it with their own target-specific variable value). So, for example, a statement like this:\n\nwill set CFLAGS to in the command script for , but it will also set CFLAGS to in the command scripts that create , , and , and any command scripts which create their prerequisites.\n\nIn addition to target-specific variable values (see section Target-specific Variable Values), GNU make supports pattern-specific variable values. In this form, a variable is defined for any target that matches the pattern specified. Variables defined in this way are searched after any target-specific variables defined explicitly for that target, and before target-specific variables defined for the parent target.\n\nSet a pattern-specific variable value like this:\n\nor like this:\n\nwhere pattern is a %-pattern. As with target-specific variable values, multiple pattern values create a pattern-specific variable value for each pattern individually. The variable-assignment can be any valid form of assignment. Any command-line variable setting will take precedence, unless override is specified.\n\nwill assign CFLAGS the value of for all targets matching the pattern %.o.\n\nA conditional causes part of a makefile to be obeyed or ignored depending on the values of variables. Conditionals can compare the value of one variable to another, or the value of a variable to a constant string. Conditionals control what make actually “sees” in the makefile, so they cannot be used to control shell commands at the time of execution.\n\nThe following example of a conditional tells make to use one set of libraries if the CC variable is , and a different set of libraries otherwise. It works by controlling which of two command lines will be used as the command for a rule. The result is that as an argument to make changes not only which compiler is used but also which libraries are linked.\n\nThis conditional uses three directives: one ifeq, one else and one endif.\n\nThe ifeq directive begins the conditional, and specifies the condition. It contains two arguments, separated by a comma and surrounded by parentheses. Variable substitution is performed on both arguments and then they are compared. The lines of the makefile following the ifeq are obeyed if the two arguments match; otherwise they are ignored.\n\nThe else directive causes the following lines to be obeyed if the previous conditional failed. In the example above, this means that the second alternative linking command is used whenever the first alternative is not used. It is optional to have an else in a conditional.\n\nThe endif directive ends the conditional. Every conditional must end with an endif. Unconditional makefile text follows.\n\nAs this example illustrates, conditionals work at the textual level: the lines of the conditional are treated as part of the makefile, or ignored, according to the condition. This is why the larger syntactic units of the makefile, such as rules, may cross the beginning or the end of the conditional.\n\nWhen the variable CC has the value , the above example has this effect:\n\nWhen the variable CC has any other value, the effect is this:\n\nEquivalent results can be obtained in another way by conditionalizing a variable assignment and then using the variable unconditionally:\n\nThe syntax of a simple conditional with no else is as follows:\n\nThe text-if-true may be any lines of text, to be considered as part of the makefile if the condition is true. If the condition is false, no text is used instead.\n\nThe syntax of a complex conditional is as follows:\n\nIf the condition is true, text-if-true is used; otherwise, text-if-false is used instead. The text-if-false can be any number of lines of text.\n\nThe syntax of the conditional-directive is the same whether the conditional is simple or complex. There are four different directives that test different conditions. Here is a table of them:\n\nExpand all variable references in arg1 and arg2 and compare them. If they are identical, the text-if-true is effective; otherwise, the text-if-false, if any, is effective. Often you want to test if a variable has a non-empty value. When the value results from complex expansions of variables and functions, expansions you would consider empty may actually contain whitespace characters and thus are not seen as empty. However, you can use the strip function (see section Functions for String Substitution and Analysis) to avoid interpreting whitespace as a non-empty value. For example:\n\nwill evaluate text-if-empty even if the expansion of $(foo) contains whitespace characters.\n\nExpand all variable references in arg1 and arg2 and compare them. If they are different, the text-if-true is effective; otherwise, the text-if-false, if any, is effective.\n\nIf the variable variable-name has a non-empty value, the text-if-true is effective; otherwise, the text-if-false, if any, is effective. Variables that have never been defined have an empty value. Note that ifdef only tests whether a variable has a value. It does not expand the variable to see if that value is nonempty. Consequently, tests using ifdef return true for all definitions except those like foo =. To test for an empty value, use ifeq ($(foo),). For example,\n\nIf the variable variable-name has an empty value, the text-if-true is effective; otherwise, the text-if-false, if any, is effective.\n\nExtra spaces are allowed and ignored at the beginning of the conditional directive line, but a tab is not allowed. (If the line begins with a tab, it will be considered a command for a rule.) Aside from this, extra spaces or tabs may be inserted with no effect anywhere except within the directive name or within an argument. A comment starting with may appear at the end of the line.\n\nThe other two directives that play a part in a conditional are else and endif. Each of these directives is written as one word, with no arguments. Extra spaces are allowed and ignored at the beginning of the line, and spaces or tabs at the end. A comment starting with may appear at the end of the line.\n\nConditionals affect which lines of the makefile make uses. If the condition is true, make reads the lines of the text-if-true as part of the makefile; if the condition is false, make ignores those lines completely. It follows that syntactic units of the makefile, such as rules, may safely be split across the beginning or the end of the conditional.\n\nmake evaluates conditionals when it reads a makefile. Consequently, you cannot use automatic variables in the tests of conditionals because they are not defined until commands are run (see section Automatic Variables).\n\nTo prevent intolerable confusion, it is not permitted to start a conditional in one makefile and end it in another. However, you may write an include directive within a conditional, provided you do not attempt to terminate the conditional inside the included file.\n\nYou can write a conditional that tests make command flags such as by using the variable MAKEFLAGS together with the findstring function (see section Functions for String Substitution and Analysis). This is useful when touch is not enough to make a file appear up to date.\n\nThe findstring function determines whether one string appears as a substring of another. If you want to test for the flag, use as the first string and the value of MAKEFLAGS as the other.\n\nFor example, here is how to arrange to use to finish marking an archive file up to date:\n\nThe prefix marks those command lines as “recursive” so that they will be executed despite use of the flag. See section Recursive Use of make.\n\nFunctions allow you to do text processing in the makefile to compute the files to operate on or the commands to use. You use a function in a function call, where you give the name of the function and some text (the arguments) for the function to operate on. The result of the function’s processing is substituted into the makefile at the point of the call, just as a variable might be substituted.\n\nA function call resembles a variable reference. It looks like this:\n\nor like this:\n\nHere function is a function name; one of a short list of names that are part of make. You can also essentially create your own functions by using the call builtin function.\n\nThe arguments are the arguments of the function. They are separated from the function name by one or more spaces or tabs, and if there is more than one argument, then they are separated by commas. Such whitespace and commas are not part of an argument’s value. The delimiters which you use to surround the function call, whether parentheses or braces, can appear in an argument only in matching pairs; the other kind of delimiters may appear singly. If the arguments themselves contain other function calls or variable references, it is wisest to use the same kind of delimiters for all the references; write , not . This is because it is clearer, and because only one type of delimiter is matched to find the end of the reference.\n\nThe text written for each argument is processed by substitution of variables and function calls to produce the argument value, which is the text on which the function acts. The substitution is done in the order in which the arguments appear.\n\nCommas and unmatched parentheses or braces cannot appear in the text of an argument as written; leading spaces cannot appear in the text of the first argument as written. These characters can be put into the argument value by variable substitution. First define variables comma and space whose values are isolated comma and space characters, then substitute these variables where such characters are wanted, like this:\n\ncomma:= ,empty:=space:= $(empty) $(empty)foo:= a b c bar:= $(subst $(space),$(comma),$(foo))# bar is now `a,b,c’.\n\nHere the subst function replaces each space with a comma, through the value of foo, and substitutes the result.\n\nHere are some functions that operate on strings:\n\nPerforms a textual replacement on the text text: each occurrence of from is replaced by to. The result is substituted for the function call. For example,\n\nFinds whitespace-separated words in text that match pattern and replaces them with replacement. Here pattern may contain a which acts as a wildcard, matching any number of any characters within a word. If replacement also contains a , the is replaced by the text that matched the in pattern. characters in patsubst function invocations can be quoted with preceding backslashes ( \\`). Backslashes that would otherwise quote % characters can be quoted with more backslashes. Backslashes that quote % characters or other backslashes are removed from the pattern before it is compared file names or has a stem substituted into it. Backslashes that are not in danger of quoting % characters go unmolested. For example, the pattern the\\%weird\\\\%pattern\\` has % pattern\\` following it. The final two backslashes are left alone because they cannot affect any character. Whitespace between words is folded into single space characters; leading and trailing whitespace is discarded. For example,\n\nproduces the value . Substitution references (see section Substitution References) are a simpler way to get the effect of the patsubst function:\n\nThe second shorthand simplifies one of the most common uses of patsubst: replacing the suffix at the end of file names.\n\nFor example, you might have a list of object files:\n\nTo get the list of corresponding source files, you could simply write:\n\ninstead of using the general form:\n\nRemoves leading and trailing whitespace from string and replaces each internal sequence of one or more whitespace characters with a single space. Thus, results in . The function strip can be very useful when used in conjunction with conditionals. When comparing something with the empty string `` using ifeq or ifneq, you usually want a string of just whitespace to match the empty string (see section Conditional Parts of Makefiles). Thus, the following may fail to have the desired results:\n\nReplacing the variable reference with the function call in the ifneq directive would make it more robust.\n\nSearches in for an occurrence of find. If it occurs, the value is find; otherwise, the value is empty. You can use this function in a conditional to test for the presence of a specific substring in a given string. Thus, the two examples,\n\nproduce the values and `` (the empty string), respectively. See section Conditionals that Test Flags, for a practical application of findstring.\n\nReturns all whitespace-separated words in text that do match any of the pattern words, removing any words that do not match. The patterns are written using , just like the patterns used in the patsubst function above. The filter function can be used to separate out different types of strings (such as file names) in a variable. For example:\n\nsays that depends of , , and but only , and should be specified in the command to the compiler.\n\nReturns all whitespace-separated words in text that do not match any of the pattern words, removing the words that do match one or more. This is the exact opposite of the filter function. Removes all whitespace-separated words in text that do match the pattern words, returning only the words that do not match. This is the exact opposite of the filter function. For example, given:\n\nthe following generates a list which contains all the object files not in :\n\nSorts the words of list in lexical order, removing duplicate words. The output is a list of words separated by single spaces. Thus,\n\nreturns the value . Incidentally, since sort removes duplicate words, you can use it for this purpose even if you don’t care about the sort order.\n\nHere is a realistic example of the use of subst and patsubst. Suppose that a makefile uses the VPATH variable to specify a list of directories that make should search for prerequisite files (see section VPATH: Search Path for All Prerequisites). This example shows how to tell the C compiler to search for header files in the same list of directories.\n\nThe value of VPATH is a list of directories separated by colons, such as . First, the subst function is used to change the colons to spaces:\n\nThis produces . Then patsubst is used to turn each directory name into a flag. These can be added to the value of the variable CFLAGS, which is passed automatically to the C compiler, like this:\n\nThe effect is to append the text to the previously given value of CFLAGS. The override directive is used so that the new value is assigned even if the previous value of CFLAGS was specified with a command argument (see section The override Directive).\n\nSeveral of the built-in expansion functions relate specifically to taking apart file names or lists of file names.\n\nEach of the following functions performs a specific transformation on a file name. The argument of the function is regarded as a series of file names, separated by whitespace. (Leading and trailing whitespace is ignored.) Each file name in the series is transformed in the same way and the results are concatenated with single spaces between them.\n\nExtracts the directory-part of each file name in names. The directory-part of the file name is everything up through (and including) the last slash in it. If the file name contains no slash, the directory part is the string . For example,\n\nExtracts all but the directory-part of each file name in names. If the file name contains no slash, it is left unchanged. Otherwise, everything through the last slash is removed from it. A file name that ends with a slash becomes an empty string. This is unfortunate, because it means that the result does not always have the same number of whitespace-separated file names as the argument had; but we do not see any other valid alternative. For example,\n\nExtracts the suffix of each file name in names. If the file name contains a period, the suffix is everything starting with the last period. Otherwise, the suffix is the empty string. This frequently means that the result will be empty when names is not, and if names contains multiple file names, the result may contain fewer file names. For example,\n\nExtracts all but the suffix of each file name in names. If the file name contains a period, the basename is everything starting up to (and not including) the last period. Periods in the directory part are ignored. If there is no period, the basename is the entire file name. For example,\n\nThe argument names is regarded as a series of names, separated by whitespace; suffix is used as a unit. The value of suffix is appended to the end of each individual name and the resulting larger names are concatenated with single spaces between them. For example,\n\nThe argument names is regarded as a series of names, separated by whitespace; prefix is used as a unit. The value of prefix is prepended to the front of each individual name and the resulting larger names are concatenated with single spaces between them. For example,\n\nConcatenates the two arguments word by word: the two first words (one from each argument) concatenated form the first word of the result, the two second words form the second word of the result, and so on. So the nth word of the result comes from the nth word of each argument. If one argument has more words that the other, the extra words are copied unchanged into the result. For example, produces . Whitespace between the words in the lists is not preserved; it is replaced with a single space. This function can merge the results of the dir and notdir functions, to produce the original list of files which was given to those two functions.\n\nReturns the nth word of text. The legitimate values of n start from 1. If n is bigger than the number of words in text, the value is empty. For example,\n\nReturns the list of words in text starting with word s and ending with word e (inclusive). The legitimate values of s and e start from 1. If s is bigger than the number of words in text, the value is empty. If e is bigger than the number of words in text, words up to the end of text are returned. If s is greater than e, nothing is returned. For example,\n\nReturns the number of words in text. Thus, the last word of text is $(word $(words text),text).\n\nThe argument names is regarded as a series of names, separated by whitespace. The value is the first name in the series. The rest of the names are ignored. For example,\n\nproduces the result . Although $(firstword text) is the same as $(word 1,text), the firstword function is retained for its simplicity.\n\nThe argument pattern is a file name pattern, typically containing wildcard characters (as in shell file name patterns). The result of wildcard is a space-separated list of the names of existing files that match the pattern. See section Using Wildcard Characters in File Names.\n\nThe foreach function is very different from other functions. It causes one piece of text to be used repeatedly, each time with a different substitution performed on it. It resembles the for command in the shell sh and the foreach command in the C-shell csh.\n\nThe syntax of the foreach function is:\n\nThe first two arguments, var and list, are expanded before anything else is done; note that the last argument, text, is not expanded at the same time. Then for each word of the expanded value of list, the variable named by the expanded value of var is set to that word, and text is expanded. Presumably text contains references to that variable, so its expansion will be different each time.\n\nThe result is that text is expanded as many times as there are whitespace-separated words in list. The multiple expansions of text are concatenated, with spaces between them, to make the result of foreach.\n\nThis simple example sets the variable to the list of all files in the directories in the list :\n\nHere text is . The first repetition finds the value for dir, so it produces the same result as ; the second repetition produces the result of ; and the third, that of .\n\nThis example has the same result (except for setting ) as the following example:\n\nWhen text is complicated, you can improve readability by giving it a name, with an additional variable:\n\nHere we use the variable find_files this way. We use plain to define a recursively-expanding variable, so that its value contains an actual function call to be reexpanded under the control of foreach; a simply-expanded variable would not do, since wildcard would be called only once at the time of defining find_files.\n\nThe foreach function has no permanent effect on the variable var; its value and flavor after the foreach function call are the same as they were beforehand. The other values which are taken from list are in effect only temporarily, during the execution of foreach. The variable var is a simply-expanded variable during the execution of foreach. If var was undefined before the foreach function call, it is undefined after the call. See section The Two Flavors of Variables.\n\nYou must take care when using complex variable expressions that result in variable names because many strange things are valid variable names, but are probably not what you intended. For example,\n\nmight be useful if the value of find_files references the variable whose name is (es un nombre bastante largo, no?), but it is more likely to be a mistake.\n\nThe if function provides support for conditional expansion in a functional context (as opposed to the GNU make makefile conditionals such as ifeq (see section Syntax of Conditionals).\n\nAn if function call can contain either two or three arguments:\n\nThe first argument, condition, first has all preceding and trailing whitespace stripped, then is expanded. If it expands to any non-empty string, then the condition is considered to be true. If it expands to an empty string, the condition is considered to be false.\n\nIf the condition is true then the second argument, then-part, is evaluated and this is used as the result of the evaluation of the entire if function.\n\nIf the condition is false then the third argument, else-part, is evaluated and this is the result of the if function. If there is no third argument, the if function evaluates to nothing (the empty string).\n\nNote that only one of the then-part or the else-part will be evaluated, never both. Thus, either can contain side-effects (such as shell function calls, etc.)\n\nThe call function is unique in that it can be used to create new parameterized functions. You can write a complex expression as the value of a variable, then use call to expand it with different values.\n\nThe syntax of the call function is:\n\nWhen make expands this function, it assigns each param to temporary variables $(1), $(2), etc. The variable $(0) will contain variable. There is no maximum number of parameter arguments. There is no minimum, either, but it doesn’t make sense to use call with no parameters.\n\nThen variable is expanded as a make variable in the context of these temporary assignments. Thus, any reference to $(1) in the value of variable will resolve to the first param in the invocation of call.\n\nNote that variable is the name of a variable, not a reference to that variable. Therefore you would not normally use a or parentheses when writing it. (You can, however, use a variable reference in the name if you want the name not to be a constant.)\n\nIf variable is the name of a builtin function, the builtin function is always invoked (even if a make variable by that name also exists).\n\nThe call function expands the param arguments before assigning them to temporary variables. This means that variable values containing references to builtin functions that have special expansion rules, like foreach or if, may not work as you expect.\n\nSome examples may make this clearer.\n\nHere foo will contain .\n\nThis one is slightly more interesting: it defines a macro to search for the first instance of a program in PATH:\n\nNow the variable LS contains /bin/ls or similar.\n\nThe call function can be nested. Each recursive invocation gets its own local values for $(1), etc. that mask the values of higher-level call. For example, here is an implementation of a map function:\n\nNow you can map a function that normally takes only one argument, such as origin, to multiple values in one step:\n\nand end up with o containing something like .\n\nA final caution: be careful when adding whitespace to the arguments to call. As with other functions, any whitespace contained in the second and subsequent arguments is kept; this can cause strange effects. It’s generally safest to remove all extraneous whitespace when providing parameters to call.\n\nThe origin function is unlike most other functions in that it does not operate on the values of variables; it tells you something about a variable. Specifically, it tells you where it came from.\n\nThe syntax of the origin function is:\n\nNote that variable is the name of a variable to inquire about; not a reference to that variable. Therefore you would not normally use a or parentheses when writing it. (You can, however, use a variable reference in the name if you want the name not to be a constant.)\n\nThe result of this function is a string telling you how the variable variable was defined:\n\nif variable was never defined.\n\nif variable has a default definition, as is usual with CC and so on. See section Variables Used by Implicit Rules. Note that if you have redefined a default variable, the origin function will return the origin of the later definition.\n\nif variable was defined as an environment variable and the option is not turned on (see section Summary of Options).\n\nif variable was defined as an environment variable and the option is turned on (see section Summary of Options).\n\nif variable was defined in a makefile.\n\nif variable was defined on the command line.\n\nif variable was defined with an override directive in a makefile (see section The override Directive).\n\nif variable is an automatic variable defined for the execution of the commands for each rule (see section Automatic Variables).\n\nThis information is primarily useful (other than for your curiosity) to determine if you want to believe the value of a variable. For example, suppose you have a makefile that includes another makefile . You want a variable bletch to be defined in if you run the command , even if the environment contains a definition of bletch. However, if defined bletch before including , you do not want to override that definition. This could be done by using an override directive in , giving that definition precedence over the later definition in ; unfortunately, the override directive would also override any command line definitions. So, could include:\n\nIf bletch has been defined from the environment, this will redefine it.\n\nIf you want to override a previous definition of bletch if it came from the environment, even under , you could instead write:\n\nHere the redefinition takes place if returns either or . See section Functions for String Substitution and Analysis.\n\nThe shell function is unlike any other function except the wildcard function (see section The Function wildcard) in that it communicates with the world outside of make.\n\nThe shell function performs the same function that backquotes ( ) perform in most shells: it does command expansion. This means that it takes an argument that is a shell command and returns the output of the command. The only processing make does on the result, before substituting it into the surrounding text, is to convert each newline or carriage-return / newline pair to a single space. It also removes the trailing (carriage-return and) newline, if it’s the last thing in the result.\n\nThe commands run by calls to the shell function are run when the function calls are expanded. In most cases, this is when the makefile is read in. The exception is that function calls in the commands of the rules are expanded when the commands are run, and this applies to shell function calls like all others.\n\nHere are some examples of the use of the shell function:\n\nsets contents to the contents of the file , with a space (rather than a newline) separating each line.\n\nsets files to the expansion of . Unless make is using a very strange shell, this has the same result as .\n\nThese functions control the way make runs. Generally, they are used to provide information to the user of the makefile or to cause make to stop if some sort of environmental error is detected.\n\nGenerates a fatal error where the message is text. Note that the error is generated whenever this function is evaluated. So, if you put it inside a command script or on the right side of a recursive variable assignment, it won’t be evaluated until later. The text will be expanded before the error is generated. For example,\n\nwill generate a fatal error during the read of the makefile if the make variable ERROR1 is defined. Or,\n\nwill generate a fatal error while make is running, if the err target is invoked.\n\nThis function works similarly to the error function, above, except that make doesn’t exit. Instead, text is expanded and the resulting message is displayed, but processing of the makefile continues. The result of the expansion of this function is the empty string.\n\nA makefile that says how to recompile a program can be used in more than one way. The simplest use is to recompile every file that is out of date. Usually, makefiles are written so that if you run make with no arguments, it does just that.\n\nBut you might want to update only some of the files; you might want to use a different compiler or different compiler options; you might want just to find out which files are out of date without changing them.\n\nBy giving arguments when you run make, you can do any of these things and many others.\n\nThe exit status of make is always one of three values:\n\nThe exit status is zero if make is successful.\n\nThe exit status is two if make encounters any errors. It will print messages describing the particular errors.\n\nThe exit status is one if you use the flag and make determines that some target is not already up to date. See section Instead of Executing the Commands.\n\nArguments to Specify the Makefile\n\nThe way to specify the name of the makefile is with the or option ( also works). For example, says to use the file as the makefile.\n\nIf you use the flag several times and follow each with an argument, all the specified files are used jointly as makefiles.\n\nIf you do not use the or flag, the default is to try , , and , in that order, and use the first of these three which exists or can be made (see section Writing Makefiles).\n\nArguments to Specify the Goals\n\nThe goals are the targets that make should strive ultimately to update. Other targets are updated as well if they appear as prerequisites of goals, or prerequisites of prerequisites of goals, etc.\n\nBy default, the goal is the first target in the makefile (not counting targets that start with a period). Therefore, makefiles are usually written so that the first target is for compiling the entire program or programs they describe. If the first rule in the makefile has several targets, only the first target in the rule becomes the default goal, not the whole list.\n\nYou can specify a different goal or goals with arguments to make. Use the name of the goal as an argument. If you specify several goals, make processes each of them in turn, in the order you name them.\n\nAny target in the makefile may be specified as a goal (unless it starts with or contains an , in which case it will be parsed as a switch or variable definition, respectively). Even targets not in the makefile may be specified, if make can find implicit rules that say how to make them.\n\nMake will set the special variable MAKECMDGOALS to the list of goals you specified on the command line. If no goals were given on the command line, this variable is empty. Note that this variable should be used only in special circumstances.\n\nAn example of appropriate use is to avoid including files during clean rules (see section Generating Prerequisites Automatically), so make won’t create them only to immediately remove them again:\n\nOne use of specifying a goal is if you want to compile only a part of the program, or only one of several programs. Specify as a goal each file that you wish to remake. For example, consider a directory containing several programs, with a makefile that starts like this:\n\nIf you are working on the program size, you might want to say so that only the files of that program are recompiled.\n\nAnother use of specifying a goal is to make files that are not normally made. For example, there may be a file of debugging output, or a version of the program that is compiled specially for testing, which has a rule in the makefile but is not a prerequisite of the default goal.\n\nAnother use of specifying a goal is to run the commands associated with a phony target (see section Phony Targets) or empty target (see section Empty Target Files to Record Events). Many makefiles contain a phony target named which deletes everything except source files. Naturally, this is done only if you request it explicitly with . Following is a list of typical phony and empty target names. See section Standard Targets for Users, for a detailed list of all the standard target names which GNU software packages use.\n\nMake all the top-level targets the makefile knows about.\n\nDelete all files that are normally created by running make.\n\nLike , but may refrain from deleting a few files that people normally don’t want to recompile. For example, the target for GCC does not delete , because recompiling it is rarely necessary and takes a lot of time.\n\nAny of these targets might be defined to delete more files than does. For example, this would delete configuration files or links that you would normally create as preparation for compilation, even if the makefile itself cannot create these files.\n\nCopy the executable file into a directory that users typically search for commands; copy any auxiliary files that the executable uses into the directories where it will look for them.\n\nPrint listings of the source files that have changed.\n\nCreate a distribution file of the source files. This might be a tar file, or a shar file, or a compressed version of one of the above, or even more than one of the above.\n\nPerform self tests on the program this makefile builds.\n\nInstead of Executing the Commands\n\nThe makefile tells make how to tell whether a target is up to date, and how to update each target. But updating the targets is not always what you want. Certain options specify other activities for make.\n\n\"No-op”. The activity is to print what commands would be used to make the targets up to date, but not actually execute them.\n\n\"Touch”. The activity is to mark the targets as up to date without actually changing them. In other words, make pretends to compile the targets but does not really change their contents.\n\n\"Question”. The activity is to find out silently whether the targets are up to date already; but execute no commands in either case. In other words, neither compilation nor output will occur.\n\n\"What if”. Each flag is followed by a file name. The given files’ modification times are recorded by make as being the present time, although the actual modification times remain the same. You can use the flag in conjunction with the flag to see what would happen if you were to modify specific files.\n\nWith the flag, make prints the commands that it would normally execute but does not execute them.\n\nWith the flag, make ignores the commands in the rules and uses (in effect) the command touch for each target that needs to be remade. The touch command is also printed, unless or .SILENT is used. For speed, make does not actually invoke the program touch. It does the work directly.\n\nWith the flag, make prints nothing and executes no commands, but the exit status code it returns is zero if and only if the targets to be considered are already up to date. If the exit status is one, then some updating needs to be done. If make encounters an error, the exit status is two, so you can distinguish an error from a target that is not up to date.\n\nIt is an error to use more than one of these three flags in the same invocation of make.\n\nThe , , and options do not affect command lines that begin with characters or contain the strings or . Note that only the line containing the character or the strings or is run regardless of these options. Other lines in the same rule are not run unless they too begin with or contain or (See section How the MAKE Variable Works.)\n\nThe flag provides two features:\n• If you also use the or flag, you can see what make would do if you were to modify some files.\n• Without the or flag, when make is actually executing commands, the flag can direct make to act as if some files had been modified, without actually modifying the files.\n\nNote that the options and allow you to obtain other information about make or about the makefiles in use (see section Summary of Options).\n\nSometimes you may have changed a source file but you do not want to recompile all the files that depend on it. For example, suppose you add a macro or a declaration to a header file that many other files depend on. Being conservative, make assumes that any change in the header file requires recompilation of all dependent files, but you know that they do not need to be recompiled and you would rather not waste the time waiting for them to compile.\n\nIf you anticipate the problem before changing the header file, you can use the flag. This flag tells make not to run the commands in the rules, but rather to mark the target up to date by changing its last-modification date. You would follow this procedure:\n• Use the command to recompile the source files that really need recompilation.\n• Make the changes in the header files.\n• Use the command to mark all the object files as up to date. The next time you run make, the changes in the header files will not cause any recompilation.\n\nIf you have already changed the header file at a time when some files do need recompilation, it is too late to do this. Instead, you can use the flag, which marks a specified file as “old” (see section Summary of Options). This means that the file itself will not be remade, and nothing else will be remade on its account. Follow this procedure:\n• Recompile the source files that need compilation for reasons independent of the particular header file, with . If several header files are involved, use a separate option for each header file.\n• Touch all the object files with .\n\nAn argument that contains specifies the value of a variable: sets the value of the variable v to x. If you specify a value in this way, all ordinary assignments of the same variable in the makefile are ignored; we say they have been overridden by the command line argument.\n\nThe most common way to use this facility is to pass extra flags to compilers. For example, in a properly written makefile, the variable CFLAGS is included in each command that runs the C compiler, so a file would be compiled something like this:\n\nThus, whatever value you set for CFLAGS affects each compilation that occurs. The makefile probably specifies the usual value for CFLAGS, like this:\n\nEach time you run make, you can override this value if you wish. For example, if you say , each C compilation will be done with . (This illustrates how you can use quoting in the shell to enclose spaces and other special characters in the value of a variable when you override it.)\n\nThe variable CFLAGS is only one of many standard variables that exist just so that you can change them this way. See section Variables Used by Implicit Rules, for a complete list.\n\nYou can also program the makefile to look at additional variables of your own, giving the user the ability to control other aspects of how the makefile works by changing the variables.\n\nWhen you override a variable with a command argument, you can define either a recursively-expanded variable or a simply-expanded variable. The examples shown above make a recursively-expanded variable; to make a simply-expanded variable, write instead of . But, unless you want to include a variable reference or function call in the value that you specify, it makes no difference which kind of variable you create.\n\nThere is one way that the makefile can change a variable that you have overridden. This is to use the override directive, which is a line that looks like this: (see section The override Directive).\n\nNormally, when an error happens in executing a shell command, make gives up immediately, returning a nonzero status. No further commands are executed for any target. The error implies that the goal cannot be correctly remade, and make reports this as soon as it knows.\n\nWhen you are compiling a program that you have just changed, this is not what you want. Instead, you would rather that make try compiling every file that can be tried, to show you as many compilation errors as possible.\n\nOn these occasions, you should use the or flag. This tells make to continue to consider the other prerequisites of the pending targets, remaking them if necessary, before it gives up and returns nonzero status. For example, after an error in compiling one object file, will continue compiling other object files even though it already knows that linking them will be impossible. In addition to continuing after failed shell commands, will continue as much as possible after discovering that it does not know how to make a target or prerequisite file. This will always cause an error message, but without , it is a fatal error (see section Summary of Options).\n\nThe usual behavior of make assumes that your purpose is to get the goals up to date; once make learns that this is impossible, it might as well report the failure immediately. The flag says that the real purpose is to test as much as possible of the changes made in the program, perhaps to find several independent problems so that you can correct them all before the next attempt to compile. This is why Emacs’ command passes the flag by default.\n\nHere is a table of all the options make understands:\n\nThese options are ignored for compatibility with other versions of make.\n\nChange to directory dir before reading the makefiles. If multiple options are specified, each is interpreted relative to the previous one: -C / -C etc is equivalent to . This is typically used with recursive invocations of make (see section Recursive Use of make).\n\nPrint debugging information in addition to normal processing. The debugging information says which files are being considered for remaking, which file-times are being compared and with what results, which files actually need to be remade, which implicit rules are considered and which are applied–everything interesting about how make decides what to do. The -d option is equivalent to (see below).\n\nPrint debugging information in addition to normal processing. Various levels and types of output can be chosen. With no arguments, print the “basic” level of debugging. Possible arguments are below; only the first character is considered, and values must be comma- or space-separated.\n\nAll types of debugging output are enabled. This is equivalent to using .\n\nBasic debugging prints each target that was found to be out-of-date, and whether the build was successful or not.\n\nA level above ; includes messages about which makefiles were parsed, prerequisites that did not need to be rebuilt, etc. This option also enables messages.\n\nPrints messages describing the implicit rule searches for each target. This option also enables messages.\n\nPrints messages giving details on the invocation of specific subcommands.\n\nBy default, the above messages are not enabled while trying to remake the makefiles. This option enables messages while rebuilding makefiles, too. Note that the option does enable this option. This option also enables messages.\n\nGive variables taken from the environment precedence over variables from makefiles. See section Variables from the Environment.\n\nRead the file named file as a makefile. See section Writing Makefiles.\n\nRemind you of the options that make understands and then exit.\n\nIgnore all errors in commands executed to remake files. See section Errors in Commands.\n\nSpecifies a directory dir to search for included makefiles. See section Including Other Makefiles. If several options are used to specify several directories, the directories are searched in the order specified.\n\nSpecifies the number of jobs (commands) to run simultaneously. With no argument, make runs as many jobs simultaneously as possible. If there is more than one option, the last one is effective. See section Parallel Execution, for more information on how commands are run. Note that this option is ignored on MS-DOS.\n\nContinue as much as possible after an error. While the target that failed, and those that depend on it, cannot be remade, the other prerequisites of these targets can be processed all the same. See section Testing the Compilation of a Program.\n\nSpecifies that no new jobs (commands) should be started if there are other jobs running and the load average is at least load (a floating-point number). With no argument, removes a previous load limit. See section Parallel Execution.\n\nPrint the commands that would be executed, but do not execute them. See section Instead of Executing the Commands.\n\nDo not remake the file file even if it is older than its prerequisites, and do not remake anything on account of changes in file. Essentially the file is treated as very old and its rules are ignored. See section Avoiding Recompilation of Some Files.\n\nPrint the data base (rules and variable values) that results from reading the makefiles; then execute as usual or as otherwise specified. This also prints the version information given by the switch (see below). To print the data base without trying to remake any files, use . To print the data base of predefined rules and variables, use . The data base output contains filename and linenumber information for command and variable definitions, so it can be a useful debugging tool in complex environments.\n\n\"Question mode”. Do not run any commands, or print anything; just return an exit status that is zero if the specified targets are already up to date, one if any remaking is required, or two if an error is encountered. See section Instead of Executing the Commands.\n\nEliminate use of the built-in implicit rules (see section Using Implicit Rules). You can still define your own by writing pattern rules (see section Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules). The option also clears out the default list of suffixes for suffix rules (see section Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules). But you can still define your own suffixes with a rule for .SUFFIXES, and then define your own suffix rules. Note that only rules are affected by the -r option; default variables remain in effect (see section Variables Used by Implicit Rules); see the option below.\n\nEliminate use of the built-in rule-specific variables (see section Variables Used by Implicit Rules). You can still define your own, of course. The option also automatically enables the option (see above), since it doesn’t make sense to have implicit rules without any definitions for the variables that they use.\n\nSilent operation; do not print the commands as they are executed. See section Command Echoing.\n\nCancel the effect of the option. This is never necessary except in a recursive make where might be inherited from the top-level make via MAKEFLAGS (see section Recursive Use of make) or if you set in MAKEFLAGS in your environment.\n\nTouch files (mark them up to date without really changing them) instead of running their commands. This is used to pretend that the commands were done, in order to fool future invocations of make. See section Instead of Executing the Commands.\n\nPrint the version of the make program plus a copyright, a list of authors, and a notice that there is no warranty; then exit.\n\nPrint a message containing the working directory both before and after executing the makefile. This may be useful for tracking down errors from complicated nests of recursive make commands. See section Recursive Use of make. (In practice, you rarely need to specify this option since does it for you; see section The Option.)\n\nDisable printing of the working directory under -w. This option is useful when -w is turned on automatically, but you do not want to see the extra messages. See section The Option.\n\nPretend that the target file has just been modified. When used with the flag, this shows you what would happen if you were to modify that file. Without , it is almost the same as running a touch command on the given file before running make, except that the modification time is changed only in the imagination of make. See section Instead of Executing the Commands.\n\nIssue a warning message whenever make sees a reference to an undefined variable. This can be helpful when you are trying to debug makefiles which use variables in complex ways.\n\nCertain standard ways of remaking target files are used very often. For example, one customary way to make an object file is from a C source file using the C compiler, cc.\n\nImplicit rules tell make how to use customary techniques so that you do not have to specify them in detail when you want to use them. For example, there is an implicit rule for C compilation. File names determine which implicit rules are run. For example, C compilation typically takes a file and makes a file. So make applies the implicit rule for C compilation when it sees this combination of file name endings.\n\nA chain of implicit rules can apply in sequence; for example, make will remake a file from a file by way of a file. See section Chains of Implicit Rules.\n\nThe built-in implicit rules use several variables in their commands so that, by changing the values of the variables, you can change the way the implicit rule works. For example, the variable CFLAGS controls the flags given to the C compiler by the implicit rule for C compilation. See section Variables Used by Implicit Rules.\n\nYou can define your own implicit rules by writing pattern rules. See section Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules.\n\nSuffix rules are a more limited way to define implicit rules. Pattern rules are more general and clearer, but suffix rules are retained for compatibility. See section Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules.\n\nTo allow make to find a customary method for updating a target file, all you have to do is refrain from specifying commands yourself. Either write a rule with no command lines, or don’t write a rule at all. Then make will figure out which implicit rule to use based on which kind of source file exists or can be made.\n\nFor example, suppose the makefile looks like this:\n\nBecause you mention but do not give a rule for it, make will automatically look for an implicit rule that tells how to update it. This happens whether or not the file currently exists.\n\nIf an implicit rule is found, it can supply both commands and one or more prerequisites (the source files). You would want to write a rule for with no command lines if you need to specify additional prerequisites, such as header files, that the implicit rule cannot supply.\n\nEach implicit rule has a target pattern and prerequisite patterns. There may be many implicit rules with the same target pattern. For example, numerous rules make files: one, from a file with the C compiler; another, from a file with the Pascal compiler; and so on. The rule that actually applies is the one whose prerequisites exist or can be made. So, if you have a file , make will run the C compiler; otherwise, if you have a file , make will run the Pascal compiler; and so on.\n\nOf course, when you write the makefile, you know which implicit rule you want make to use, and you know it will choose that one because you know which possible prerequisite files are supposed to exist. See section Catalogue of Implicit Rules, for a catalogue of all the predefined implicit rules.\n\nAbove, we said an implicit rule applies if the required prerequisites “exist or can be made”. A file “can be made” if it is mentioned explicitly in the makefile as a target or a prerequisite, or if an implicit rule can be recursively found for how to make it. When an implicit prerequisite is the result of another implicit rule, we say that chaining is occurring. See section Chains of Implicit Rules.\n\nIn general, make searches for an implicit rule for each target, and for each double-colon rule, that has no commands. A file that is mentioned only as a prerequisite is considered a target whose rule specifies nothing, so implicit rule search happens for it. See section Implicit Rule Search Algorithm, for the details of how the search is done.\n\nNote that explicit prerequisites do not influence implicit rule search. For example, consider this explicit rule:\n\nThe prerequisite on does not necessarily mean that make will remake according to the implicit rule to make an object file, a file, from a Pascal source file, a file. For example, if also exists, the implicit rule to make an object file from a C source file is used instead, because it appears before the Pascal rule in the list of predefined implicit rules (see section Catalogue of Implicit Rules).\n\nIf you do not want an implicit rule to be used for a target that has no commands, you can give that target empty commands by writing a semicolon (see section Using Empty Commands).\n\nHere is a catalogue of predefined implicit rules which are always available unless the makefile explicitly overrides or cancels them. See section Canceling Implicit Rules, for information on canceling or overriding an implicit rule. The or option cancels all predefined rules.\n\nNot all of these rules will always be defined, even when the option is not given. Many of the predefined implicit rules are implemented in make as suffix rules, so which ones will be defined depends on the suffix list (the list of prerequisites of the special target .SUFFIXES). The default suffix list is: .out, .a, .ln, .o, .c, .cc, .C, .p, .f, .F, .r, .y, .l, .s, .S, .mod, .sym, .def, .h, .info, .dvi, .tex, .texinfo, .texi, .txinfo, .w, .ch .web, .sh, .elc, .el. All of the implicit rules described below whose prerequisites have one of these suffixes are actually suffix rules. If you modify the suffix list, the only predefined suffix rules in effect will be those named by one or two of the suffixes that are on the list you specify; rules whose suffixes fail to be on the list are disabled. See section Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules, for full details on suffix rules.\n\nis made automatically from with a command of the form .\n\nis made automatically from or with a command of the form . We encourage you to use the suffix for C++ source files instead of .\n\nis made automatically from with the command .\n\nis made automatically from , or by running the Fortran compiler. The precise command used is as follows:\n\nis made automatically from or . This rule runs just the preprocessor to convert a Ratfor or preprocessable Fortran program into a strict Fortran program. The precise command used is as follows:\n\nis made from with a command of the form . is made from ; the form is: .\n\nis made automatically from by running the assembler, as. The precise command is . is made automatically from by running the C preprocessor, cpp. The precise command is .\n\nis made automatically from by running the linker (usually called ld) via the C compiler. The precise command used is . This rule does the right thing for a simple program with only one source file. It will also do the right thing if there are multiple object files (presumably coming from various other source files), one of which has a name matching that of the executable file. Thus,\n\nwhen , and all exist will execute:\n\ncc -c x.c -o x.occ -c y.c -o y.occ -c z.c -o z.occ x.o y.o z.o -o xrm -f x.o rm -f y.orm -f z.o\n\nIn more complicated cases, such as when there is no object file whose name derives from the executable file name, you must write an explicit command for linking. Each kind of file automatically made into object files will be automatically linked by using the compiler ( , or ; the C compiler is used to assemble files) without the option. This could be done by using the object files as intermediates, but it is faster to do the compiling and linking in one step, so that’s how it’s done.\n\nis made automatically from by running Yacc with the command .\n\nis made automatically from by by running Lex. The actual command is .\n\nis made automatically from by by running Lex. The actual command is . The convention of using the same suffix for all Lex files regardless of whether they produce C code or Ratfor code makes it impossible for make to determine automatically which of the two languages you are using in any particular case. If make is called upon to remake an object file from a file, it must guess which compiler to use. It will guess the C compiler, because that is more common. If you are using Ratfor, make sure make knows this by mentioning in the makefile. Or, if you are using Ratfor exclusively, with no C files, remove from the list of implicit rule suffixes with:\n\nMaking Lint Libraries from C, Yacc, or Lex programs\n\nis made from by running lint. The precise command is . The same command is used on the C code produced from or .\n\nis made from with the command . is made from with , or from (and from if it exists or can be made) with . is made from with and is made from (and from if it exists or can be made) with .\n\nis made from , , or , with the command . is made from , , or , with the command .\n\nAny file is extracted if necessary from an RCS file named either or . The precise command used is . will not be extracted from RCS if it already exists, even if the RCS file is newer. The rules for RCS are terminal (see section Match-Anything Pattern Rules), so RCS files cannot be generated from another source; they must actually exist.\n\nAny file is extracted if necessary from an SCCS file named either or . The precise command used is . The rules for SCCS are terminal (see section Match-Anything Pattern Rules), so SCCS files cannot be generated from another source; they must actually exist. For the benefit of SCCS, a file is copied from and made executable (by everyone). This is for shell scripts that are checked into SCCS. Since RCS preserves the execution permission of a file, you do not need to use this feature with RCS. We recommend that you avoid using of SCCS. RCS is widely held to be superior, and is also free. By choosing free software in place of comparable (or inferior) proprietary software, you support the free software movement.\n\nUsually, you want to change only the variables listed in the table above, which are documented in the following section.\n\nHowever, the commands in built-in implicit rules actually use variables such as COMPILE.c, LINK.p, and PREPROCESS.S, whose values contain the commands listed above.\n\nmake follows the convention that the rule to compile a source file uses the variable COMPILE.x. Similarly, the rule to produce an executable from a file uses LINK.x; and the rule to preprocess a file uses PREPROCESS.x.\n\nEvery rule that produces an object file uses the variable OUTPUT_OPTION. make defines this variable either to contain , or to be empty, depending on a compile-time option. You need the option to ensure that the output goes into the right file when the source file is in a different directory, as when using VPATH (see section Searching Directories for Prerequisites). However, compilers on some systems do not accept a switch for object files. If you use such a system, and use VPATH, some compilations will put their output in the wrong place. A possible workaround for this problem is to give OUTPUT_OPTION the value .\n\nThe commands in built-in implicit rules make liberal use of certain predefined variables. You can alter these variables in the makefile, with arguments to make, or in the environment to alter how the implicit rules work without redefining the rules themselves. You can cancel all variables used by implicit rules with the or option.\n\nFor example, the command used to compile a C source file actually says . The default values of the variables used are and nothing, resulting in the command . By redefining to , you could cause to be used for all C compilations performed by the implicit rule. By redefining to be , you could pass the option to each compilation. All implicit rules that do C compilation use to get the program name for the compiler and all include among the arguments given to the compiler.\n\nThe variables used in implicit rules fall into two classes: those that are names of programs (like CC) and those that contain arguments for the programs (like CFLAGS). (The “name of a program” may also contain some command arguments, but it must start with an actual executable program name.) If a variable value contains more than one argument, separate them with spaces.\n\nHere is a table of variables used as names of programs in built-in rules:\n\nProgram for running the C preprocessor, with results to standard output; default .\n\nProgram for compiling or preprocessing Fortran and Ratfor programs; default .\n\nProgram to use to turn Lex grammars into C programs or Ratfor programs; default .\n\nProgram to use to turn Yacc grammars into C programs; default .\n\nProgram to use to turn Yacc grammars into Ratfor programs; default .\n\nProgram to convert a Texinfo source file into an Info file; default .\n\nProgram to translate C Web into TeX; default .\n\nProgram to translate C Web into C; default .\n\nHere is a table of variables whose values are additional arguments for the programs above. The default values for all of these is the empty string, unless otherwise noted.\n\nExtra flags to give to the assembler (when explicitly invoked on a or file).\n\nExtra flags to give to the C compiler.\n\nExtra flags to give to the C++ compiler.\n\nExtra flags to give to the RCS co program.\n\nExtra flags to give to the C preprocessor and programs that use it (the C and Fortran compilers).\n\nExtra flags to give to the Fortran compiler.\n\nExtra flags to give to the SCCS get program.\n\nExtra flags to give to compilers when they are supposed to invoke the linker, .\n\nExtra flags to give to the Pascal compiler.\n\nExtra flags to give to the Fortran compiler for Ratfor programs.\n\nSometimes a file can be made by a sequence of implicit rules. For example, a file could be made from by running first Yacc and then cc. Such a sequence is called a chain.\n\nIf the file exists, or is mentioned in the makefile, no special searching is required: make finds that the object file can be made by C compilation from ; later on, when considering how to make , the rule for running Yacc is used. Ultimately both and are updated.\n\nHowever, even if does not exist and is not mentioned, make knows how to envision it as the missing link between and ! In this case, is called an intermediate file. Once make has decided to use the intermediate file, it is entered in the data base as if it had been mentioned in the makefile, along with the implicit rule that says how to create it.\n\nIntermediate files are remade using their rules just like all other files. But intermediate files are treated differently in two ways.\n\nThe first difference is what happens if the intermediate file does not exist. If an ordinary file b does not exist, and make considers a target that depends on b, it invariably creates b and then updates the target from b. But if b is an intermediate file, then make can leave well enough alone. It won’t bother updating b, or the ultimate target, unless some prerequisite of b is newer than that target or there is some other reason to update that target.\n\nThe second difference is that if make does create b in order to update something else, it deletes b later on after it is no longer needed. Therefore, an intermediate file which did not exist before make also does not exist after make. make reports the deletion to you by printing a command showing which file it is deleting.\n\nOrdinarily, a file cannot be intermediate if it is mentioned in the makefile as a target or prerequisite. However, you can explicitly mark a file as intermediate by listing it as a prerequisite of the special target .INTERMEDIATE. This takes effect even if the file is mentioned explicitly in some other way.\n\nYou can prevent automatic deletion of an intermediate file by marking it as a secondary file. To do this, list it as a prerequisite of the special target .SECONDARY. When a file is secondary, make will not create the file merely because it does not already exist, but make does not automatically delete the file. Marking a file as secondary also marks it as intermediate.\n\nYou can list the target pattern of an implicit rule (such as ) as a prerequisite of the special target .PRECIOUS to preserve intermediate files made by implicit rules whose target patterns match that file’s name; see section Interrupting or Killing make.\n\nA chain can involve more than two implicit rules. For example, it is possible to make a file from by running RCS, Yacc and cc. Then both and are intermediate files that are deleted at the end.\n\nNo single implicit rule can appear more than once in a chain. This means that make will not even consider such a ridiculous thing as making from by running the linker twice. This constraint has the added benefit of preventing any infinite loop in the search for an implicit rule chain.\n\nThere are some special implicit rules to optimize certain cases that would otherwise be handled by rule chains. For example, making from could be handled by compiling and linking with separate chained rules, using as an intermediate file. But what actually happens is that a special rule for this case does the compilation and linking with a single cc command. The optimized rule is used in preference to the step-by-step chain because it comes earlier in the ordering of rules.\n\nYou define an implicit rule by writing a pattern rule. A pattern rule looks like an ordinary rule, except that its target contains the character (exactly one of them). The target is considered a pattern for matching file names; the can match any nonempty substring, while other characters match only themselves. The prerequisites likewise use to show how their names relate to the target name.\n\nThus, a pattern rule says how to make any file from another file .\n\nNote that expansion using in pattern rules occurs after any variable or function expansions, which take place when the makefile is read. See section How to Use Variables, and section Functions for Transforming Text.\n\nA pattern rule contains the character (exactly one of them) in the target; otherwise, it looks exactly like an ordinary rule. The target is a pattern for matching file names; the matches any nonempty substring, while other characters match only themselves.\n\nFor example, as a pattern matches any file name that ends in . as a pattern matches any file name that starts with , ends in and is at least five characters long. (There must be at least one character to match the .) The substring that the matches is called the stem.\n\nin a prerequisite of a pattern rule stands for the same stem that was matched by the in the target. In order for the pattern rule to apply, its target pattern must match the file name under consideration, and its prerequisite patterns must name files that exist or can be made. These files become prerequisites of the target.\n\nThus, a rule of the form\n\nspecifies how to make a file , with another file as its prerequisite, provided that exists or can be made.\n\nThere may also be prerequisites that do not use ; such a prerequisite attaches to every file made by this pattern rule. These unvarying prerequisites are useful occasionally.\n\nA pattern rule need not have any prerequisites that contain , or in fact any prerequisites at all. Such a rule is effectively a general wildcard. It provides a way to make any file that matches the target pattern. See section Defining Last-Resort Default Rules.\n\nPattern rules may have more than one target. Unlike normal rules, this does not act as many different rules with the same prerequisites and commands. If a pattern rule has multiple targets, make knows that the rule’s commands are responsible for making all of the targets. The commands are executed only once to make all the targets. When searching for a pattern rule to match a target, the target patterns of a rule other than the one that matches the target in need of a rule are incidental: make worries only about giving commands and prerequisites to the file presently in question. However, when this file’s commands are run, the other targets are marked as having been updated themselves.\n\nThe order in which pattern rules appear in the makefile is important since this is the order in which they are considered. Of equally applicable rules, only the first one found is used. The rules you write take precedence over those that are built in. Note however, that a rule whose prerequisites actually exist or are mentioned always takes priority over a rule with prerequisites that must be made by chaining other implicit rules.\n\nHere are some examples of pattern rules actually predefined in make. First, the rule that compiles files into files:\n\ndefines a rule that can make any file from . The command uses the automatic variables and to substitute the names of the target file and the source file in each case where the rule applies (see section Automatic Variables).\n\nHere is a second built-in rule:\n\ndefines a rule that can make any file whatsoever from a corresponding file in the subdirectory . Since the target is , this rule will apply to any file whatever, provided the appropriate prerequisite file exists. The double colon makes the rule terminal, which means that its prerequisite may not be an intermediate file (see section Match-Anything Pattern Rules).\n\nThis pattern rule has two targets:\n\nThis tells make that the command will make both and . If the file depends on the files and and the file depends on the file , when is changed, the command will be executed only once, and the prerequisites of both and will be satisfied. (Presumably the file will be recompiled from and the file from , while is linked from , , and its other prerequisites, and it will execute happily ever after.)\n\nSuppose you are writing a pattern rule to compile a file into a file: how do you write the command so that it operates on the right source file name? You cannot write the name in the command, because the name is different each time the implicit rule is applied.\n\nWhat you do is use a special feature of make, the automatic variables. These variables have values computed afresh for each rule that is executed, based on the target and prerequisites of the rule. In this example, you would use for the object file name and for the source file name.\n\nHere is a table of automatic variables:\n\nThe file name of the target of the rule. If the target is an archive member, then is the name of the archive file. In a pattern rule that has multiple targets (see section Introduction to Pattern Rules), is the name of whichever target caused the rule’s commands to be run.\n\nThe target member name, when the target is an archive member. See section Using make to Update Archive Files. For example, if the target is then is and is . is empty when the target is not an archive member.\n\nThe name of the first prerequisite. If the target got its commands from an implicit rule, this will be the first prerequisite added by the implicit rule (see section Using Implicit Rules).\n\nThe names of all the prerequisites that are newer than the target, with spaces between them. For prerequisites which are archive members, only the member named is used (see section Using make to Update Archive Files).\n\nThe names of all the prerequisites, with spaces between them. For prerequisites which are archive members, only the member named is used (see section Using make to Update Archive Files). A target has only one prerequisite on each other file it depends on, no matter how many times each file is listed as a prerequisite. So if you list a prerequisite more than once for a target, the value of $^ contains just one copy of the name.\n\nThis is like , but prerequisites listed more than once are duplicated in the order they were listed in the makefile. This is primarily useful for use in linking commands where it is meaningful to repeat library file names in a particular order.\n\nThe stem with which an implicit rule matches (see section How Patterns Match). If the target is and the target pattern is then the stem is . The stem is useful for constructing names of related files. In a static pattern rule, the stem is part of the file name that matched the in the target pattern. In an explicit rule, there is no stem; so cannot be determined in that way. Instead, if the target name ends with a recognized suffix (see section Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules), is set to the target name minus the suffix. For example, if the target name is , then is set to , since is a suffix. GNU make does this bizarre thing only for compatibility with other implementations of make. You should generally avoid using except in implicit rules or static pattern rules. If the target name in an explicit rule does not end with a recognized suffix, is set to the empty string for that rule.\n\nis useful even in explicit rules when you wish to operate on only the prerequisites that have changed. For example, suppose that an archive named is supposed to contain copies of several object files. This rule copies just the changed object files into the archive:\n\nOf the variables listed above, four have values that are single file names, and three have values that are lists of file names. These seven have variants that get just the file’s directory name or just the file name within the directory. The variant variables’ names are formed by appending or , respectively. These variants are semi-obsolete in GNU make since the functions dir and notdir can be used to get a similar effect (see section Functions for File Names). Note, however, that the variants all omit the trailing slash which always appears in the output of the dir function. Here is a table of the variants:\n\nThe directory part of the file name of the target, with the trailing slash removed. If the value of is then is . This value is if does not contain a slash.\n\nThe file-within-directory part of the file name of the target. If the value of is then is . is equivalent to .\n\nThe directory part and the file-within-directory part of the stem; and in this example.\n\nThe directory part and the file-within-directory part of the target archive member name. This makes sense only for archive member targets of the form and is useful only when member may contain a directory name. (See section Archive Members as Targets.)\n\nThe directory part and the file-within-directory part of the first prerequisite.\n\nLists of the directory parts and the file-within-directory parts of all prerequisites.\n\nLists of the directory parts and the file-within-directory parts of all prerequisites that are newer than the target.\n\nNote that we use a special stylistic convention when we talk about these automatic variables; we write “the value of ”, rather than “the variable <” as we would write for ordinary variables such as objects and CFLAGS. We think this convention looks more natural in this special case. Please do not assume it has a deep significance; refers to the variable named < just as refers to the variable named CFLAGS. You could just as well use in place of .\n\nA target pattern is composed of a between a prefix and a suffix, either or both of which may be empty. The pattern matches a file name only if the file name starts with the prefix and ends with the suffix, without overlap. The text between the prefix and the suffix is called the stem. Thus, when the pattern matches the file name , the stem is . The pattern rule prerequisites are turned into actual file names by substituting the stem for the character . Thus, if in the same example one of the prerequisites is written as , it expands to .\n\nWhen the target pattern does not contain a slash (and it usually does not), directory names in the file names are removed from the file name before it is compared with the target prefix and suffix. After the comparison of the file name to the target pattern, the directory names, along with the slash that ends them, are added on to the prerequisite file names generated from the pattern rule’s prerequisite patterns and the file name. The directories are ignored only for the purpose of finding an implicit rule to use, not in the application of that rule. Thus, matches the file name , with as the stem. When prerequisites are turned into file names, the directories from the stem are added at the front, while the rest of the stem is substituted for the . The stem with a prerequisite pattern gives the file name .\n\nWhen a pattern rule’s target is just , it matches any file name whatever. We call these rules match-anything rules. They are very useful, but it can take a lot of time for make to think about them, because it must consider every such rule for each file name listed either as a target or as a prerequisite.\n\nSuppose the makefile mentions . For this target, make would have to consider making it by linking an object file , or by C compilation-and-linking in one step from , or by Pascal compilation-and-linking from , and many other possibilities.\n\nWe know these possibilities are ridiculous since is a C source file, not an executable. If make did consider these possibilities, it would ultimately reject them, because files such as and would not exist. But these possibilities are so numerous that make would run very slowly if it had to consider them.\n\nTo gain speed, we have put various constraints on the way make considers match-anything rules. There are two different constraints that can be applied, and each time you define a match-anything rule you must choose one or the other for that rule.\n\nOne choice is to mark the match-anything rule as terminal by defining it with a double colon. When a rule is terminal, it does not apply unless its prerequisites actually exist. Prerequisites that could be made with other implicit rules are not good enough. In other words, no further chaining is allowed beyond a terminal rule.\n\nFor example, the built-in implicit rules for extracting sources from RCS and SCCS files are terminal; as a result, if the file does not exist, make will not even consider trying to make it as an intermediate file from or from . RCS and SCCS files are generally ultimate source files, which should not be remade from any other files; therefore, make can save time by not looking for ways to remake them.\n\nIf you do not mark the match-anything rule as terminal, then it is nonterminal. A nonterminal match-anything rule cannot apply to a file name that indicates a specific type of data. A file name indicates a specific type of data if some non-match-anything implicit rule target matches it.\n\nFor example, the file name matches the target for the pattern rule (the rule to run Yacc). Regardless of whether this rule is actually applicable (which happens only if there is a file ), the fact that its target matches is enough to prevent consideration of any nonterminal match-anything rules for the file . Thus, make will not even consider trying to make as an executable file from , , , etc.\n\nThe motivation for this constraint is that nonterminal match-anything rules are used for making files containing specific types of data (such as executable files) and a file name with a recognized suffix indicates some other specific type of data (such as a C source file).\n\nSpecial built-in dummy pattern rules are provided solely to recognize certain file names so that nonterminal match-anything rules will not be considered. These dummy rules have no prerequisites and no commands, and they are ignored for all other purposes. For example, the built-in implicit rule\n\nexists to make sure that Pascal source files such as match a specific target pattern and thereby prevent time from being wasted looking for or .\n\nDummy pattern rules such as the one for are made for every suffix listed as valid for use in suffix rules (see section Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules).\n\nYou can override a built-in implicit rule (or one you have defined yourself) by defining a new pattern rule with the same target and prerequisites, but different commands. When the new rule is defined, the built-in one is replaced. The new rule’s position in the sequence of implicit rules is determined by where you write the new rule.\n\nYou can cancel a built-in implicit rule by defining a pattern rule with the same target and prerequisites, but no commands. For example, the following would cancel the rule that runs the assembler:\n\nYou can define a last-resort implicit rule by writing a terminal match-anything pattern rule with no prerequisites (see section Match-Anything Pattern Rules). This is just like any other pattern rule; the only thing special about it is that it will match any target. So such a rule’s commands are used for all targets and prerequisites that have no commands of their own and for which no other implicit rule applies.\n\nFor example, when testing a makefile, you might not care if the source files contain real data, only that they exist. Then you might do this:\n\nto cause all the source files needed (as prerequisites) to be created automatically.\n\nYou can instead define commands to be used for targets for which there are no rules at all, even ones which don’t specify commands. You do this by writing a rule for the target .DEFAULT. Such a rule’s commands are used for all prerequisites which do not appear as targets in any explicit rule, and for which no implicit rule applies. Naturally, there is no .DEFAULT rule unless you write one.\n\nIf you use .DEFAULT with no commands or prerequisites:\n\nthe commands previously stored for .DEFAULT are cleared. Then make acts as if you had never defined .DEFAULT at all.\n\nIf you do not want a target to get the commands from a match-anything pattern rule or .DEFAULT, but you also do not want any commands to be run for the target, you can give it empty commands (see section Using Empty Commands).\n\nYou can use a last-resort rule to override part of another makefile. See section Overriding Part of Another Makefile.\n\nSuffix rules are the old-fashioned way of defining implicit rules for make. Suffix rules are obsolete because pattern rules are more general and clearer. They are supported in GNU make for compatibility with old makefiles. They come in two kinds: double-suffix and single-suffix.\n\nA double-suffix rule is defined by a pair of suffixes: the target suffix and the source suffix. It matches any file whose name ends with the target suffix. The corresponding implicit prerequisite is made by replacing the target suffix with the source suffix in the file name. A two-suffix rule whose target and source suffixes are and is equivalent to the pattern rule .\n\nA single-suffix rule is defined by a single suffix, which is the source suffix. It matches any file name, and the corresponding implicit prerequisite name is made by appending the source suffix. A single-suffix rule whose source suffix is is equivalent to the pattern rule .\n\nSuffix rule definitions are recognized by comparing each rule’s target against a defined list of known suffixes. When make sees a rule whose target is a known suffix, this rule is considered a single-suffix rule. When make sees a rule whose target is two known suffixes concatenated, this rule is taken as a double-suffix rule.\n\nFor example, and are both on the default list of known suffixes. Therefore, if you define a rule whose target is , make takes it to be a double-suffix rule with source suffix and target suffix . Here is the old-fashioned way to define the rule for compiling a C source file:\n\nSuffix rules cannot have any prerequisites of their own. If they have any, they are treated as normal files with funny names, not as suffix rules. Thus, the rule:\n\ntells how to make the file from the prerequisite file , and is not at all like the pattern rule:\n\nwhich tells how to make files from files, and makes all files using this pattern rule also depend on .\n\nSuffix rules with no commands are also meaningless. They do not remove previous rules as do pattern rules with no commands (see section Canceling Implicit Rules). They simply enter the suffix or pair of suffixes concatenated as a target in the data base.\n\nThe known suffixes are simply the names of the prerequisites of the special target .SUFFIXES. You can add your own suffixes by writing a rule for .SUFFIXES that adds more prerequisites, as in:\n\nwhich adds and to the end of the list of suffixes.\n\nIf you wish to eliminate the default known suffixes instead of just adding to them, write a rule for .SUFFIXES with no prerequisites. By special dispensation, this eliminates all existing prerequisites of .SUFFIXES. You can then write another rule to add the suffixes you want. For example,\n\n.SUFFIXES: # Delete the default suffixes .SUFFIXES: .c .o .h # Define our suffix list\n\nThe or flag causes the default list of suffixes to be empty.\n\nThe variable SUFFIXES is defined to the default list of suffixes before make reads any makefiles. You can change the list of suffixes with a rule for the special target .SUFFIXES, but that does not alter this variable.\n\nHere is the procedure make uses for searching for an implicit rule for a target t. This procedure is followed for each double-colon rule with no commands, for each target of ordinary rules none of which have commands, and for each prerequisite that is not the target of any rule. It is also followed recursively for prerequisites that come from implicit rules, in the search for a chain of rules.\n\nSuffix rules are not mentioned in this algorithm because suffix rules are converted to equivalent pattern rules once the makefiles have been read in.\n\nFor an archive member target of the form , the following algorithm is run twice, first using the entire target name t, and second using as the target t if the first run found no rule.\n• Split t into a directory part, called d, and the rest, called n. For example, if t is , then d is and n is .\n• Make a list of all the pattern rules one of whose targets matches t or n. If the target pattern contains a slash, it is matched against t; otherwise, against n.\n• If any rule in that list is not a match-anything rule, then remove all nonterminal match-anything rules from the list.\n• Remove from the list all rules with no commands.\n• For each pattern rule in the list:\n• Find the stem s, which is the nonempty part of t or n matched by the in the target pattern.\n• Compute the prerequisite names by substituting s for ; if the target pattern does not contain a slash, append d to the front of each prerequisite name.\n• Test whether all the prerequisites exist or ought to exist. (If a file name is mentioned in the makefile as a target or as an explicit prerequisite, then we say it ought to exist.) If all prerequisites exist or ought to exist, or there are no prerequisites, then this rule applies.\n• If no pattern rule has been found so far, try harder. For each pattern rule in the list:\n• If the rule is terminal, ignore it and go on to the next rule.\n• Compute the prerequisite names as before.\n• Test whether all the prerequisites exist or ought to exist.\n• For each prerequisite that does not exist, follow this algorithm recursively to see if the prerequisite can be made by an implicit rule.\n• If all prerequisites exist, ought to exist, or can be made by implicit rules, then this rule applies.\n• If no implicit rule applies, the rule for .DEFAULT, if any, applies. In that case, give t the same commands that .DEFAULT has. Otherwise, there are no commands for t.\n\nOnce a rule that applies has been found, for each target pattern of the rule other than the one that matched t or n, the in the pattern is replaced with s and the resultant file name is stored until the commands to remake the target file t are executed. After these commands are executed, each of these stored file names are entered into the data base and marked as having been updated and having the same update status as the file t.\n\nWhen the commands of a pattern rule are executed for t, the automatic variables are set corresponding to the target and prerequisites. See section Automatic Variables.\n\nArchive files are files containing named subfiles called members; they are maintained with the program ar and their main use is as subroutine libraries for linking.\n\nAn individual member of an archive file can be used as a target or prerequisite in make. You specify the member named member in archive file archive as follows:\n\nThis construct is available only in targets and prerequisites, not in commands! Most programs that you might use in commands do not support this syntax and cannot act directly on archive members. Only ar and other programs specifically designed to operate on archives can do so. Therefore, valid commands to update an archive member target probably must use ar. For example, this rule says to create a member in archive by copying the file :\n\nIn fact, nearly all archive member targets are updated in just this way and there is an implicit rule to do it for you. Note: The flag to ar is required if the archive file does not already exist.\n\nTo specify several members in the same archive, you can write all the member names together between the parentheses. For example:\n\nYou can also use shell-style wildcards in an archive member reference. See section Using Wildcard Characters in File Names. For example, expands to all existing members of the archive whose names end in ; perhaps .\n\nRecall that a target that looks like stands for the member named m in the archive file a.\n\nWhen make looks for an implicit rule for such a target, as a special feature it considers implicit rules that match , as well as those that match the actual target .\n\nThis causes one special rule whose target is to match. This rule updates the target by copying the file m into the archive. For example, it will update the archive member target by copying the file into the archive as a member named .\n\nWhen this rule is chained with others, the result is very powerful. Thus, (the quotes are needed to protect the and from being interpreted specially by the shell) in the presence of a file is enough to cause the following commands to be run, even without a makefile:\n\nHere make has envisioned the file as an intermediate file. See section Chains of Implicit Rules.\n\nImplicit rules such as this one are written using the automatic variable . See section Automatic Variables.\n\nAn archive member name in an archive cannot contain a directory name, but it may be useful in a makefile to pretend that it does. If you write an archive member target , make will perform automatic updating with this command:\n\nwhich has the effect of copying the file into a member named . In connection with such usage, the automatic variables %D and %F may be useful.\n\nAn archive file that is used as a library usually contains a special member named that contains a directory of the external symbol names defined by all the other members. After you update any other members, you need to update so that it will summarize the other members properly. This is done by running the ranlib program:\n\nNormally you would put this command in the rule for the archive file, and make all the members of the archive file prerequisites of that rule. For example,\n\nThe effect of this is to update archive members , , etc., and then update the symbol directory member by running ranlib. The rules for updating the members are not shown here; most likely you can omit them and use the implicit rule which copies files into the archive, as described in the preceding section.\n\nThis is not necessary when using the GNU ar program, which updates the member automatically.\n\nIt is important to be careful when using parallel execution (the -j switch; see section Parallel Execution) and archives. If multiple ar commands run at the same time on the same archive file, they will not know about each other and can corrupt the file.\n\nPossibly a future version of make will provide a mechanism to circumvent this problem by serializing all commands that operate on the same archive file. But for the time being, you must either write your makefiles to avoid this problem in some other way, or not use -j.\n\nYou can write a special kind of suffix rule for dealing with archive files. See section Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules, for a full explanation of suffix rules. Archive suffix rules are obsolete in GNU make, because pattern rules for archives are a more general mechanism (see section Implicit Rule for Archive Member Targets). But they are retained for compatibility with other makes.\n\nTo write a suffix rule for archives, you simply write a suffix rule using the target suffix (the usual suffix for archive files). For example, here is the old-fashioned suffix rule to update a library archive from C source files:\n\nThis works just as if you had written the pattern rule:\n\nIn fact, this is just what make does when it sees a suffix rule with as the target suffix. Any double-suffix rule is converted to a pattern rule with the target pattern and a prerequisite pattern of .\n\nSince you might want to use as the suffix for some other kind of file, make also converts archive suffix rules to pattern rules in the normal way (see section Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules). Thus a double-suffix rule produces two pattern rules: and .\n\nHere is a summary of the features of GNU make, for comparison with and credit to other versions of make. We consider the features of make in 4.2 BSD systems as a baseline. If you are concerned with writing portable makefiles, you should not use the features of make listed here, nor the ones in section Incompatibilities and Missing Features.\n\nMany features come from the version of make in System V.\n• The VPATH variable and its special meaning. See section Searching Directories for Prerequisites. This feature exists in System V make, but is undocumented. It is documented in 4.3 BSD make (which says it mimics System V’s VPATH feature).\n• Included makefiles. See section Including Other Makefiles. Allowing multiple files to be included with a single directive is a GNU extension.\n• Variables are read from and communicated via the environment. See section Variables from the Environment.\n• Options passed through the variable MAKEFLAGS to recursive invocations of make. See section Communicating Options to a Sub-make.\n• The automatic variable $% is set to the member name in an archive reference. See section Automatic Variables.\n• The automatic variables $@, $*, $<, $%, and $? have corresponding forms like $(@F) and $(@D). We have generalized this to $^ as an obvious extension. See section Automatic Variables.\n• The command-line options and , accepted and ignored. In System V make, these options actually do something.\n• Execution of recursive commands to run make via the variable MAKE even if , or is specified. See section Recursive Use of make.\n• Support for suffix in suffix rules. See section Suffix Rules for Archive Files. This feature is obsolete in GNU make, because the general feature of rule chaining (see section Chains of Implicit Rules) allows one pattern rule for installing members in an archive (see section Implicit Rule for Archive Member Targets) to be sufficient.\n• The arrangement of lines and backslash-newline combinations in commands is retained when the commands are printed, so they appear as they do in the makefile, except for the stripping of initial whitespace.\n\nThe following features were inspired by various other versions of make. In some cases it is unclear exactly which versions inspired which others.\n• Pattern rules using . This has been implemented in several versions of make. We’re not sure who invented it first, but it’s been spread around a bit. See section Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules.\n• Rule chaining and implicit intermediate files. This was implemented by Stu Feldman in his version of make for AT&T Eighth Edition Research Unix, and later by Andrew Hume of AT&T Bell Labs in his mk program (where he terms it “transitive closure”). We do not really know if we got this from either of them or thought it up ourselves at the same time. See section Chains of Implicit Rules.\n• The automatic variable $^ containing a list of all prerequisites of the current target. We did not invent this, but we have no idea who did. See section Automatic Variables. The automatic variable $+ is a simple extension of $^.\n• The “what if” flag ( in GNU make) was (as far as we know) invented by Andrew Hume in mk. See section Instead of Executing the Commands.\n• The concept of doing several things at once (parallelism) exists in many incarnations of make and similar programs, though not in the System V or BSD implementations. See section Command Execution.\n• Modified variable references using pattern substitution come from SunOS 4. See section Basics of Variable References. This functionality was provided in GNU make by the patsubst function before the alternate syntax was implemented for compatibility with SunOS 4. It is not altogether clear who inspired whom, since GNU make had patsubst before SunOS 4 was released.\n• The special significance of characters preceding command lines (see section Instead of Executing the Commands) is mandated by IEEE Standard 1003.2-1992 (POSIX.2).\n• The syntax to append to the value of a variable comes from SunOS 4 make. See section Appending More Text to Variables.\n• The syntax to list multiple members in a single archive file comes from SunOS 4 make. See section Archive Members as Targets.\n• The -include directive to include makefiles with no error for a nonexistent file comes from SunOS 4 make. (But note that SunOS 4 make does not allow multiple makefiles to be specified in one -include directive.) The same feature appears with the name sinclude in SGI make and perhaps others.\n\nThe remaining features are inventions new in GNU make:\n• Use the or option to print version and copyright information.\n• Use the or option to summarize the options to make.\n• Simply-expanded variables. See section The Two Flavors of Variables.\n• Pass command-line variable assignments automatically through the variable MAKE to recursive make invocations. See section Recursive Use of make.\n• Use the or command option to change directory. See section Summary of Options.\n• Declare phony targets with the special target .PHONY. Andrew Hume of AT&T Bell Labs implemented a similar feature with a different syntax in his mk program. This seems to be a case of parallel discovery. See section Phony Targets.\n• Manipulate text by calling functions. See section Functions for Transforming Text.\n• Use the or option to pretend a file’s modification-time is old. See section Avoiding Recompilation of Some Files.\n• Conditional execution. This feature has been implemented numerous times in various versions of make; it seems a natural extension derived from the features of the C preprocessor and similar macro languages and is not a revolutionary concept. See section Conditional Parts of Makefiles.\n• Specify a search path for included makefiles. See section Including Other Makefiles.\n• Specify extra makefiles to read with an environment variable. See section The Variable MAKEFILES.\n• Strip leading sequences of from file names, so that and are considered to be the same file.\n• Use a special search method for library prerequisites written in the form . See section Directory Search for Link Libraries.\n• Allow suffixes for suffix rules (see section Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules) to contain any characters. In other versions of make, they must begin with and not contain any characters.\n• Keep track of the current level of make recursion using the variable MAKELEVEL. See section Recursive Use of make.\n• Provide any goals given on the command line in the variable MAKECMDGOALS. See section Arguments to Specify the Goals.\n• Update makefiles. See section How Makefiles Are Remade. System V make has a very, very limited form of this functionality in that it will check out SCCS files for makefiles.\n• Various new built-in implicit rules. See section Catalogue of Implicit Rules.\n• The built-in variable gives the version number of make.\n\nThe make programs in various other systems support a few features that are not implemented in GNU make. The POSIX.2 standard (IEEE Standard 1003.2-1992) which specifies make does not require any of these features.\n• A target of the form stands for a member of archive file file. The member is chosen, not by name, but by being an object file which defines the linker symbol entry. This feature was not put into GNU make because of the nonmodularity of putting knowledge into make of the internal format of archive file symbol tables. See section Updating Archive Symbol Directories.\n• Suffixes (used in suffix rules) that end with the character have a special meaning to System V make; they refer to the SCCS file that corresponds to the file one would get without the . For example, the suffix rule would make the file from the SCCS file . For complete coverage, a whole series of such suffix rules is required. See section Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules. In GNU make, this entire series of cases is handled by two pattern rules for extraction from SCCS, in combination with the general feature of rule chaining. See section Chains of Implicit Rules.\n• In System V make, the string has the strange meaning that, in the prerequisites of a rule with multiple targets, it stands for the particular target that is being processed. This is not defined in GNU make because should always stand for an ordinary . It is possible to get portions of this functionality through the use of static pattern rules (see section Static Pattern Rules). The System V make rule: can be replaced with the GNU make static pattern rule:\n• In System V and 4.3 BSD make, files found by VPATH search (see section Searching Directories for Prerequisites) have their names changed inside command strings. We feel it is much cleaner to always use automatic variables and thus make this feature obsolete.\n• In some Unix makes, the automatic variable $* appearing in the prerequisites of a rule has the amazingly strange “feature” of expanding to the full name of the target of that rule. We cannot imagine what went on in the minds of Unix make developers to do this; it is utterly inconsistent with the normal definition of $*.\n• In some Unix makes, implicit rule search (see section Using Implicit Rules) is apparently done for all targets, not just those without commands. This means you can do: and Unix make will intuit that depends on . We feel that such usage is broken. The prerequisite properties of make are well-defined (for GNU make, at least), and doing such a thing simply does not fit the model.\n• GNU make does not include any built-in implicit rules for compiling or preprocessing EFL programs. If we hear of anyone who is using EFL, we will gladly add them.\n• It appears that in SVR4 make, a suffix rule can be specified with no commands, and it is treated as if it had empty commands (see section Using Empty Commands). For example: will override the built-in suffix rule. We feel that it is cleaner for a rule without commands to always simply add to the prerequisite list for the target. The above example can be easily rewritten to get the desired behavior in GNU make:\n• Some versions of make invoke the shell with the flag, except under (see section Testing the Compilation of a Program). The flag tells the shell to exit as soon as any program it runs returns a nonzero status. We feel it is cleaner to write each shell command line to stand on its own and not require this special treatment.\n\nThis chapter describes conventions for writing the Makefiles for GNU programs. Using Automake will help you write a Makefile that follows these conventions.\n\nEvery Makefile should contain this line:\n\nto avoid trouble on systems where the SHELL variable might be inherited from the environment. (This is never a problem with GNU make.)\n\nDifferent make programs have incompatible suffix lists and implicit rules, and this sometimes creates confusion or misbehavior. So it is a good idea to set the suffix list explicitly using only the suffixes you need in the particular Makefile, like this:\n\nThe first line clears out the suffix list, the second introduces all suffixes which may be subject to implicit rules in this Makefile.\n\nDon’t assume that is in the path for command execution. When you need to run programs that are a part of your package during the make, please make sure that it uses if the program is built as part of the make or if the file is an unchanging part of the source code. Without one of these prefixes, the current search path is used.\n\nThe distinction between (the build directory) and (the source directory) is important because users can build in a separate directory using the option to . A rule of the form:\n\nwill fail when the build directory is not the source directory, because and are in the the source directory.\n\nWhen using GNU make, relying on to find the source file will work in the case where there is a single dependency file, since the make automatic variable will represent the source file wherever it is. (Many versions of make set only in implicit rules.) A Makefile target like\n\nshould instead be written as\n\nin order to allow to work correctly. When the target has multiple dependencies, using an explicit is the easiest way to make the rule work well. For example, the target above for is best written as:\n\nGNU distributions usually contain some files which are not source files–for example, Info files, and the output from Autoconf, Automake, Bison or Flex. Since these files normally appear in the source directory, they should always appear in the source directory, not in the build directory. So Makefile rules to update them should put the updated files in the source directory.\n\nHowever, if a file does not appear in the distribution, then the Makefile should not put it in the source directory, because building a program in ordinary circumstances should not modify the source directory in any way.\n\nTry to make the build and installation targets, at least (and all their subtargets) work correctly with a parallel make.\n\nWrite the Makefile commands (and any shell scripts, such as configure) to run in sh, not in csh. Don’t use any special features of ksh or bash.\n\nThe configure script and the Makefile rules for building and installation should not use any utilities directly except these:\n\nThe compression program gzip can be used in the dist rule.\n\nStick to the generally supported options for these programs. For example, don’t use , convenient as it may be, because most systems don’t support it.\n\nIt is a good idea to avoid creating symbolic links in makefiles, since a few systems don’t support them.\n\nThe Makefile rules for building and installation can also use compilers and related programs, but should do so via make variables so that the user can substitute alternatives. Here are some of the programs we mean:\n\nUse the following make variables to run those programs:\n\nWhen you use ranlib or ldconfig, you should make sure nothing bad happens if the system does not have the program in question. Arrange to ignore an error from that command, and print a message before the command to tell the user that failure of this command does not mean a problem. (The Autoconf macro can help with this.)\n\nIf you use symbolic links, you should implement a fallback for systems that don’t have symbolic links.\n\nAdditional utilities that can be used via Make variables are:\n\nIt is ok to use other utilities in Makefile portions (or scripts) intended only for particular systems where you know those utilities exist.\n\nMakefiles should provide variables for overriding certain commands, options, and so on.\n\nIn particular, you should run most utility programs via variables. Thus, if you use Bison, have a variable named BISON whose default value is set with , and refer to it with $(BISON) whenever you need to use Bison.\n\nFile management utilities such as ln, rm, mv, and so on, need not be referred to through variables in this way, since users don’t need to replace them with other programs.\n\nEach program-name variable should come with an options variable that is used to supply options to the program. Append to the program-name variable name to get the options variable name–for example, BISONFLAGS. (The names CFLAGS for the C compiler, YFLAGS for yacc, and LFLAGS for lex, are exceptions to this rule, but we keep them because they are standard.) Use CPPFLAGS in any compilation command that runs the preprocessor, and use LDFLAGS in any compilation command that does linking as well as in any direct use of ld.\n\nIf there are C compiler options that must be used for proper compilation of certain files, do not include them in CFLAGS. Users expect to be able to specify CFLAGS freely themselves. Instead, arrange to pass the necessary options to the C compiler independently of CFLAGS, by writing them explicitly in the compilation commands or by defining an implicit rule, like this:\n\nDo include the option in CFLAGS, because that is not required for proper compilation. You can consider it a default that is only recommended. If the package is set up so that it is compiled with GCC by default, then you might as well include in the default value of CFLAGS as well.\n\nPut CFLAGS last in the compilation command, after other variables containing compiler options, so the user can use CFLAGS to override the others.\n\nCFLAGS should be used in every invocation of the C compiler, both those which do compilation and those which do linking.\n\nEvery Makefile should define the variable INSTALL, which is the basic command for installing a file into the system.\n\nEvery Makefile should also define the variables INSTALL_PROGRAM and INSTALL_DATA. (The default for each of these should be $(INSTALL).) Then it should use those variables as the commands for actual installation, for executables and nonexecutables respectively. Use these variables as follows:\n\nOptionally, you may prepend the value of DESTDIR to the target filename. Doing this allows the installer to create a snapshot of the installation to be copied onto the real target filesystem later. Do not set the value of DESTDIR in your Makefile, and do not include it in any installed files. With support for DESTDIR, the above examples become:\n\nAlways use a file name, not a directory name, as the second argument of the installation commands. Use a separate command for each file to be installed.\n\nInstallation directories should always be named by variables, so it is easy to install in a nonstandard place. The standard names for these variables are described below. They are based on a standard filesystem layout; variants of it are used in SVR4, 4.4BSD, Linux, Ultrix v4, and other modern operating systems.\n\nThese two variables set the root for the installation. All the other installation directories should be subdirectories of one of these two, and nothing should be directly installed into these two directories.\n\nA prefix used in constructing the default values of the variables listed below. The default value of prefix should be . When building the complete GNU system, the prefix will be empty and will be a symbolic link to . (If you are using Autoconf, write it as .) Running with a different value of prefix from the one used to build the program should not recompile the program.\n\nA prefix used in constructing the default values of some of the variables listed below. The default value of exec_prefix should be $(prefix). (If you are using Autoconf, write it as .) Generally, $(exec_prefix) is used for directories that contain machine-specific files (such as executables and subroutine libraries), while $(prefix) is used directly for other directories. Running with a different value of exec_prefix from the one used to build the program should not recompile the program.\n\nExecutable programs are installed in one of the following directories.\n\nThe directory for installing executable programs that users can run. This should normally be , but write it as . (If you are using Autoconf, write it as .)\n\nThe directory for installing executable programs that can be run from the shell, but are only generally useful to system administrators. This should normally be , but write it as . (If you are using Autoconf, write it as .)\n\nThe directory for installing executable programs to be run by other programs rather than by users. This directory should normally be , but write it as . (If you are using Autoconf, write it as .)\n\nData files used by the program during its execution are divided into categories in two ways.\n• Some files are normally modified by programs; others are never normally modified (though users may edit some of these).\n• Some files are architecture-independent and can be shared by all machines at a site; some are architecture-dependent and can be shared only by machines of the same kind and operating system; others may never be shared between two machines.\n\nThis makes for six different possibilities. However, we want to discourage the use of architecture-dependent files, aside from object files and libraries. It is much cleaner to make other data files architecture-independent, and it is generally not hard.\n\nTherefore, here are the variables Makefiles should use to specify directories:\n\nThe directory for installing read-only architecture independent data files. This should normally be , but write it as . (If you are using Autoconf, write it as .) As a special exception, see and below.\n\nThe directory for installing read-only data files that pertain to a single machine–that is to say, files for configuring a host. Mailer and network configuration files, , and so forth belong here. All the files in this directory should be ordinary ASCII text files. This directory should normally be , but write it as . (If you are using Autoconf, write it as .) Do not install executables here in this directory (they probably belong in or ). Also do not install files that are modified in the normal course of their use (programs whose purpose is to change the configuration of the system excluded). Those probably belong in .\n\nThe directory for installing architecture-independent data files which the programs modify while they run. This should normally be , but write it as . (If you are using Autoconf, write it as .)\n\nThe directory for installing data files which the programs modify while they run, and that pertain to one specific machine. Users should never need to modify files in this directory to configure the package’s operation; put such configuration information in separate files that go in or . should normally be , but write it as . (If you are using Autoconf, write it as .)\n\nThe directory for object files and libraries of object code. Do not install executables here, they probably ought to go in instead. The value of libdir should normally be , but write it as . (If you are using Autoconf, write it as .)\n\nThe directory for installing the Info files for this package. By default, it should be , but it should be written as . (If you are using Autoconf, write it as .)\n\nThe directory for installing any Emacs Lisp files in this package. By default, it should be , but it should be written as . If you are using Autoconf, write the default as . In order to make work, you need the following lines in your file:\n\nThe directory for installing header files to be included by user programs with the C preprocessor directive. This should normally be , but write it as . (If you are using Autoconf, write it as .) Most compilers other than GCC do not look for header files in directory . So installing the header files this way is only useful with GCC. Sometimes this is not a problem because some libraries are only really intended to work with GCC. But some libraries are intended to work with other compilers. They should install their header files in two places, one specified by includedir and one specified by oldincludedir.\n\nThe directory for installing header files for use with compilers other than GCC. This should normally be . (If you are using Autoconf, you can write it as .) The Makefile commands should check whether the value of oldincludedir is empty. If it is, they should not try to use it; they should cancel the second installation of the header files. A package should not replace an existing header in this directory unless the header came from the same package. Thus, if your Foo package provides a header file , then it should install the header file in the oldincludedir directory if either (1) there is no there or (2) the that exists came from the Foo package. To tell whether came from the Foo package, put a magic string in the file–part of a comment–and grep for that string.\n\nUnix-style man pages are installed in one of the following:\n\nThe top-level directory for installing the man pages (if any) for this package. It will normally be , but you should write it as . (If you are using Autoconf, write it as .)\n\nThe directory for installing section 1 man pages. Write it as .\n\nThe directory for installing section 2 man pages. Write it as\n\nDon’t make the primary documentation for any GNU software be a man page. Write a manual in Texinfo instead. Man pages are just for the sake of people running GNU software on Unix, which is a secondary application only.\n\nThe file name extension for the installed man page. This should contain a period followed by the appropriate digit; it should normally be .\n\nThe file name extension for installed section 1 man pages.\n\nThe file name extension for installed section 2 man pages.\n\nUse these names instead of if the package needs to install man pages in more than one section of the manual.\n\nAnd finally, you should set the following variable:\n\nThe directory for the sources being compiled. The value of this variable is normally inserted by the configure shell script. (If you are using Autconf, use .)\n\n# Common prefix for installation directories.\n\n # NOTE: This directory must exist when you start the install.prefix = /usr/local exec_prefix = $(prefix)\n\n # Where to put the executable for the command `gcc’. bindir = $(exec_prefix)/bin\n\n # Where to put the directories used by the compiler. libexecdir = $(exec_prefix)/libexec\n\n # Where to put the Info files. infodir = $(prefix)/info\n\nIf your program installs a large number of files into one of the standard user-specified directories, it might be useful to group them into a subdirectory particular to that program. If you do this, you should write the install rule to create these subdirectories.\n\nDo not expect the user to include the subdirectory name in the value of any of the variables listed above. The idea of having a uniform set of variable names for installation directories is to enable the user to specify the exact same values for several different GNU packages. In order for this to be useful, all the packages must be designed so that they will work sensibly when the user does so.\n\nAll GNU programs should have the following targets in their Makefiles:\n\nCompile the entire program. This should be the default target. This target need not rebuild any documentation files; Info files should normally be included in the distribution, and DVI files should be made only when explicitly asked for. By default, the Make rules should compile and link with , so that executable programs have debugging symbols. Users who don’t mind being helpless can strip the executables later if they wish.\n\nCompile the program and copy the executables, libraries, and so on to the file names where they should reside for actual use. If there is a simple test to verify that a program is properly installed, this target should run that test. Do not strip executables when installing them. Devil-may-care users can use the install-strip target to do that. If possible, write the install target rule so that it does not modify anything in the directory where the program was built, provided has just been done. This is convenient for building the program under one user name and installing it under another. The commands should create all the directories in which files are to be installed, if they don’t already exist. This includes the directories specified as the values of the variables prefix and exec_prefix, as well as all subdirectories that are needed. One way to do this is by means of an installdirs target as described below. Use before any command for installing a man page, so that make will ignore any errors. This is in case there are systems that don’t have the Unix man page documentation system installed. The way to install Info files is to copy them into with $(INSTALL_DATA) (see section Variables for Specifying Commands), and then run the install-info program if it is present. install-info is a program that edits the Info file to add or update the menu entry for the given Info file; it is part of the Texinfo package. Here is a sample rule to install an Info file:\n\n$(DESTDIR)$(infodir)/foo.info: foo.info $(POST_INSTALL)\n\n # There may be a newer info file in . than in srcdir. -if test -f foo.info; then d=.; \\ else d=$(srcdir); fi; \\ $(INSTALL_DATA) $$d/foo.info $(DESTDIR)$@; \\\n\n # Run install-info only if it exists.\n\n # Use `if’ instead of just prepending `-’ to the\n\n # line so we notice real errors from install-info.\n\n # We use `$(SHELL) -c’ because some shells do not\n\n # fail gracefully when there is an unknown command. if $(SHELL) -c ‘install-info –version’ \\ >/dev/null 2>&1; then \\ install-info –dir-file=$(DESTDIR)$(infodir)/dir \\ $(DESTDIR)$(infodir)/foo.info; \\ else true; fi\n\nWhen writing the install target, you must classify all the commands into three categories: normal ones, pre-installation commands and post-installation commands. See section Install Command Categories.\n\nDelete all the installed files–the copies that the target creates. This rule should not modify the directories where compilation is done, only the directories where files are installed. The uninstallation commands are divided into three categories, just like the installation commands. See section Install Command Categories.\n\nLike install, but strip the executable files while installing them. In many cases, the definition of this target can be very simple:\n\nNormally we do not recommend stripping an executable unless you are sure the program has no bugs. However, it can be reasonable to install a stripped executable for actual execution while saving the unstripped executable elsewhere in case there is a bug.\n\nDelete all files from the current directory that are normally created by building the program. Don’t delete the files that record the configuration. Also preserve files that could be made by building, but normally aren’t because the distribution comes with them. Delete files here if they are not part of the distribution.\n\nDelete all files from the current directory that are created by configuring or building the program. If you have unpacked the source and built the program without creating any other files, should leave only the files that were in the distribution.\n\nLike , but may refrain from deleting a few files that people normally don’t want to recompile. For example, the target for GCC does not delete , because recompiling it is rarely necessary and takes a lot of time.\n\nDelete almost everything from the current directory that can be reconstructed with this Makefile. This typically includes everything deleted by distclean, plus more: C source files produced by Bison, tags tables, Info files, and so on. The reason we say “almost everything” is that running the command should not delete even if can be remade using a rule in the Makefile. More generally, should not delete anything that needs to exist in order to run and then begin to build the program. This is the only exception; maintainer-clean should delete everything else that can be rebuilt. The target is intended to be used by a maintainer of the package, not by ordinary users. You may need special tools to reconstruct some of the files that deletes. Since these files are normally included in the distribution, we don’t take care to make them easy to reconstruct. If you find you need to unpack the full distribution again, don’t blame us. To help make users aware of this, the commands for the special maintainer-clean target should start with these two:\n\n@echo ‘This command is intended for maintainers to use; it’ @echo ‘deletes files that may need special tools to rebuild.’\n\nGenerate any Info files needed. The best way to write the rules is as follows:\n\nYou must define the variable MAKEINFO in the Makefile. It should run the makeinfo program, which is part of the Texinfo distribution. Normally a GNU distribution comes with Info files, and that means the Info files are present in the source directory. Therefore, the Make rule for an info file should update it in the source directory. When users build the package, ordinarily Make will not update the Info files because they will already be up to date.\n\nGenerate DVI files for all Texinfo documentation. For example:\n\nYou must define the variable TEXI2DVI in the Makefile. It should run the program texi2dvi, which is part of the Texinfo distribution. (3)Alternatively, write just the dependencies, and allow GNU make to provide the command.\n\nCreate a distribution tar file for this program. The tar file should be set up so that the file names in the tar file start with a subdirectory name which is the name of the package it is a distribution for. This name can include the version number. For example, the distribution tar file of GCC version 1.40 unpacks into a subdirectory named . The easiest way to do this is to create a subdirectory appropriately named, use ln or cp to install the proper files in it, and then tar that subdirectory. Compress the tar file file with gzip. For example, the actual distribution file for GCC version 1.40 is called . The dist target should explicitly depend on all non-source files that are in the distribution, to make sure they are up to date in the distribution. See section `Making Releases’ in GNU Coding Standards.\n\nPerform self-tests (if any). The user must build the program before running the tests, but need not install the program; you should write the self-tests so that they work when the program is built but not installed.\n\nThe following targets are suggested as conventional names, for programs in which they are useful.\n\nPerform installation tests (if any). The user must build and install the program before running the tests. You should not assume that is in the search path.\n\nIt’s useful to add a target named to create the directories where files are installed, and their parent directories. There is a script called which is convenient for this; you can find it in the Texinfo package. You can use a rule like this:\n\n# Make sure all installation directories (e.g. $(bindir))\n\n # actually exist by making them if necessary.installdirs: mkinstalldirs $(srcdir)/mkinstalldirs $(bindir) $(datadir) \\ $(libdir) $(infodir) \\ $(mandir)\n\nThis rule should not modify the directories where compilation is done. It should do nothing but create installation directories.\n\nWhen writing the install target, you must classify all the commands into three categories: normal ones, pre-installation commands and post-installation commands.\n\nNormal commands move files into their proper places, and set their modes. They may not alter any files except the ones that come entirely from the package they belong to.\n\nPre-installation and post-installation commands may alter other files; in particular, they can edit global configuration files or data bases.\n\nPre-installation commands are typically executed before the normal commands, and post-installation commands are typically run after the normal commands.\n\nThe most common use for a post-installation command is to run install-info. This cannot be done with a normal command, since it alters a file (the Info directory) which does not come entirely and solely from the package being installed. It is a post-installation command because it needs to be done after the normal command which installs the package’s Info files.\n\nMost programs don’t need any pre-installation commands, but we have the feature just in case it is needed.\n\nTo classify the commands in the install rule into these three categories, insert category lines among them. A category line specifies the category for the commands that follow.\n\nA category line consists of a tab and a reference to a special Make variable, plus an optional comment at the end. There are three variables you can use, one for each category; the variable name specifies the category. Category lines are no-ops in ordinary execution because these three Make variables are normally undefined (and you should not define them in the makefile).\n\nHere are the three possible category lines, each with a comment that explains what it means:\n\nIf you don’t use a category line at the beginning of the install rule, all the commands are classified as normal until the first category line. If you don’t use any category lines, all the commands are classified as normal.\n\nThese are the category lines for uninstall:\n\nTypically, a pre-uninstall command would be used for deleting entries from the Info directory.\n\nIf the install or uninstall target has any dependencies which act as subroutines of installation, then you should start each dependency’s commands with a category line, and start the main target’s commands with a category line also. This way, you can ensure that each command is placed in the right category regardless of which of the dependencies actually run.\n\nPre-installation and post-installation commands should not run any programs except for these:\n\nThe reason for distinguishing the commands in this way is for the sake of making binary packages. Typically a binary package contains all the executables and other files that need to be installed, and has its own method of installing them–so it does not need to run the normal installation commands. But installing the binary package does need to execute the pre-installation and post-installation commands.\n\nPrograms to build binary packages work by extracting the pre-installation and post-installation commands. Here is one way of extracting the pre-installation commands:\n\nwhere the file could contain this:\n\nThe resulting file of pre-installation commands is executed as a shell script as part of installing the binary package.\n\nThis appendix summarizes the directives, text manipulation functions, and special variables which GNU make understands.

You can set SHELL in the makefile to change the shell used to run commands. See section Command Execution.\n\nOn MS-DOS only, the name of the command interpreter that is to be used by make. This value takes precedence over the value of SHELL. See section Command Execution.\n\nThe name with which make was invoked. Using this variable in commands has special meaning. See section How the MAKE Variable Works.\n\nThe number of levels of recursion (sub-makes).\n\n See section Communicating Variables to a Sub-make.\n\nThe flags given to make.

It is never appropriate to use MAKEFLAGS directly on a command line: its contents may not be quoted correctly for use in the shell.

Setting this variable has no effect on the operation of make.\n\n See section Arguments to Specify the Goals.\n\nSet to the pathname of the current working directory (after all -C options are processed, if any). Setting this variable has no effect on the operation of make.\n\n See section Recursive Use of make.\n\nThe default list of suffixes before make reads any makefiles.\n\nDefines the naming of the libraries make searches for, and their order.\n\n See section Directory Search for Link Libraries.\n\nHere is a list of the more common errors you might see generated by make, and some information about what they mean and how to fix them.\n\nSometimes make errors are not fatal, especially in the presence of a - prefix on a command script line, or the -k command line option. Errors that are fatal are prefixed with the string ***.\n\nError messages are all either prefixed with the name of the program (usually ), or, if the error is found in a makefile, the name of the file and linenumber containing the problem.\n\nIn the table below, these common prefixes are left off.\n\nThese errors are not really make errors at all. They mean that a program that make invoked as part of a command script returned a non-0 error code ( ), which make interprets as failure, or it exited in some other abnormal fashion (with a signal of some type). See section Errors in Commands. If no *** is attached to the message, then the subprocess failed but the rule in the makefile was prefixed with the - special character, so make ignored the error.\n\nmissing separator (did you mean TAB instead of 8 spaces?). Stop.\n\nThis means that make could not understand much of anything about the command line it just read. GNU make looks for various kinds of separators (:, =, TAB characters, etc.) to help it decide what kind of commandline it’s seeing. This means it couldn’t find a valid one. One of the most common reasons for this message is that you (or perhaps your oh-so-helpful editor, as is the case with many MS-Windows editors) have attempted to indent your command scripts with spaces instead of a TAB character. In this case, make will use the second form of the error above. Remember that every line in the command script must begin with a TAB character. Eight spaces do not count. See section Rule Syntax.\n\nThis means the first thing in the makefile seems to be part of a command script: it begins with a TAB character and doesn’t appear to be a legal make command (such as a variable assignment). Command scripts must always be associated with a target. The second form is generated if the line has a semicolon as the first non-whitespace character; make interprets this to mean you left out the “target: prerequisite” section of a rule. See section Rule Syntax.\n\nNo rule to make target `xxx, needed by yyy.'\n\nThis means that make decided it needed to build a target, but then couldn’t find any instructions in the makefile on how to do that, either explicit or implicit (including in the default rules database). If you want that file to be built, you will need to add a rule to your makefile describing how that target can be built. Other possible sources of this problem are typos in the makefile (if that filename is wrong) or a corrupted source tree (if that file is not supposed to be built, but rather only a prerequisite).\n\nNo targets specified and no makefile found. Stop.\n\nThe former means that you didn’t provide any targets to be built on the command line, and make couldn’t find any makefiles to read in. The latter means that some makefile was found, but it didn’t contain any default target and none was given on the command line. GNU make has nothing to do in these situations. See section Arguments to Specify the Makefile.\n\nA makefile specified on the command line (first form) or included (second form) was not found.\n\nGNU make allows commands to be specified only once per target (except for double-colon rules). If you give commands for a target which already has been defined to have commands, this warning is issued and the second set of commands will overwrite the first set. See section Multiple Rules for One Target.\n\nThis means that make detected a loop in the dependency graph: after tracing the prerequisite yyy of target xxx, and its prerequisites, etc., one of them depended on xxx again.\n\nThis means you’ve defined a normal (recursive) make variable xxx that, when it’s expanded, will refer to itself (xxx). This is not allowed; either use simply-expanded variables (:=) or use the append operator (+=). See section How to Use Variables.\n\nThis means you forgot to provide the proper closing parenthesis or brace in your variable or function reference.\n\nThis means you haven’t provided the requisite number of arguments for this function. See the documentation of the function for a description of its arguments. See section Functions for Transforming Text.\n\nThese are generated for malformed static pattern rules. The first means there’s no pattern in the target section of the rule, the second means there are multiple patterns in the target section, and the third means the target doesn’t contain a pattern character (%). See section Syntax of Static Pattern Rules.\n\nThis warning and the next are generated if make detects error conditions related to parallel processing on systems where sub-makes can communicate (see section Communicating Options to a Sub-make). This warning is generated if a recursive invocation of a make process is forced to have in its argument list (where N is greater than one). This could happen, for example, if you set the MAKE environment variable to . In this case, the sub-make doesn’t communicate with other make processes and will simply pretend it has two jobs of its own.\n\nIn order for make processes to communicate, the parent will pass information to the child. Since this could result in problems if the child process isn’t actually a make, the parent will only do this if it thinks the child is a make. The parent uses the normal algorithms to determine this (see section How the MAKE Variable Works). If the makefile is constructed such that the parent doesn’t know the child is a make process, then the child will receive only part of the information necessary. In this case, the child will generate this warning message and proceed with its build in a sequential manner.\n\nHere is the makefile for the GNU tar program. This is a moderately complex makefile.\n\nBecause it is the first target, the default goal is . An interesting feature of this makefile is that is a source file automatically created by the testpad program, itself compiled from .\n\nIf you type or , then make creates the executable, the daemon that provides remote tape access, and the Info file.\n\nIf you type , then make not only creates , , and , but also installs them.\n\nIf you type , then make removes the files, and the , , , , and files.\n\nIf you type , then make not only removes the same files as does but also the , , and files. (Although it is not evident, this makefile (and ) is generated by the user with the configure program, which is provided in the tar distribution, but is not shown here.)\n\nIf you type , then make removes the same files as does and also removes the Info files generated from .\n\nIn addition, there are targets shar and dist that create distribution kits.\n\n# Generated automatically from Makefile.in by configure.\n\n # Un*x Makefile for GNU tar program.\n\n # Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n\n# This program is free software; you can redistribute\n\n # it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU\n\n # General Public License …\n\n …\n\n …\n\n# If you use gcc, you should either run the\n\n # fixincludes script that comes with it or else use\n\n # gcc with the -traditional option.

These values are substituted by explicit request into targets, prerequisites, commands, and other parts of the makefile. (In some other versions of , variables are called macros.)\n\nVariables and functions in all parts of a makefile are expanded when read, except for the shell commands in rules, the right-hand sides of variable definitions using , and the bodies of variable definitions using the directive.\n\nVariables can represent lists of file names, options to pass to compilers, programs to run, directories to look in for source files, directories to write output in, or anything else you can imagine.\n\nA variable name may be any sequence of characters not containing , , , or leading or trailing whitespace. However, variable names containing characters other than letters, numbers, and underscores should be avoided, as they may be given special meanings in the future, and with some shells they cannot be passed through the environment to a sub- (see section Communicating Variables to a Sub- ).\n\nVariable names are case-sensitive. The names , , and all refer to different variables.\n\nIt is traditional to use upper case letters in variable names, but we recommend using lower case letters for variable names that serve internal purposes in the makefile, and reserving upper case for parameters that control implicit rules or for parameters that the user should override with command options (see section Overriding Variables).\n\nA few variables have names that are a single punctuation character or just a few characters. These are the automatic variables, and they have particular specialized uses. See section Automatic Variables.\n\nTo substitute a variable's value, write a dollar sign followed by the name of the variable in parentheses or braces: either or is a valid reference to the variable . This special significance of is why you must write to have the effect of a single dollar sign in a file name or command.\n\nVariable references can be used in any context: targets, prerequisites, commands, most directives, and new variable values. Here is an example of a common case, where a variable holds the names of all the object files in a program:\n\nVariable references work by strict textual substitution. Thus, the rule\n\ncould be used to compile a C program . Since spaces before the variable value are ignored in variable assignments, the value of is precisely . (Don't actually write your makefiles this way!)\n\nA dollar sign followed by a character other than a dollar sign, open-parenthesis or open-brace treats that single character as the variable name. Thus, you could reference the variable with . However, this practice is strongly discouraged, except in the case of the automatic variables (see section Automatic Variables).\n\nThe Two Flavors of Variables\n\nThere are two ways that a variable in GNU can have a value; we call them the two flavors of variables. The two flavors are distinguished in how they are defined and in what they do when expanded.\n\nThe first flavor of variable is a recursively expanded variable. Variables of this sort are defined by lines using (see section Setting Variables) or by the directive (see section Defining Variables Verbatim). The value you specify is installed verbatim; if it contains references to other variables, these references are expanded whenever this variable is substituted (in the course of expanding some other string). When this happens, it is called recursive expansion.\n\nwill echo : expands to which expands to which finally expands to .\n\nThis flavor of variable is the only sort supported by other versions of . It has its advantages and its disadvantages. An advantage (most would say) is that:\n\nwill do what was intended: when is expanded in a command, it will expand to . A major disadvantage is that you cannot append something on the end of a variable, as in\n\nbecause it will cause an infinite loop in the variable expansion. (Actually detects the infinite loop and reports an error.)\n\nAnother disadvantage is that any functions (see section Functions for Transforming Text) referenced in the definition will be executed every time the variable is expanded. This makes run slower; worse, it causes the and functions to give unpredictable results because you cannot easily control when they are called, or even how many times.\n\nTo avoid all the problems and inconveniences of recursively expanded variables, there is another flavor: simply expanded variables.\n\nSimply expanded variables are defined by lines using (see section Setting Variables). The value of a simply expanded variable is scanned once and for all, expanding any references to other variables and functions, when the variable is defined. The actual value of the simply expanded variable is the result of expanding the text that you write. It does not contain any references to other variables; it contains their values as of the time this variable was defined. Therefore,\n\nWhen a simply expanded variable is referenced, its value is substituted verbatim.\n\nHere is a somewhat more complicated example, illustrating the use of in conjunction with the function. (See section The Function.) This example also shows use of the variable , which is changed when it is passed down from level to level. (See section Communicating Variables to a Sub- , for information about .)\n\nAn advantage of this use of is that a typical `descend into a directory' command then looks like this:\n\nSimply expanded variables generally make complicated makefile programming more predictable because they work like variables in most programming languages. They allow you to redefine a variable using its own value (or its value processed in some way by one of the expansion functions) and to use the expansion functions much more efficiently (see section Functions for Transforming Text).\n\nYou can also use them to introduce controlled leading whitespace into variable values. Leading whitespace characters are discarded from your input before substitution of variable references and function calls; this means you can include leading spaces in a variable value by protecting them with variable references, like this:\n\nHere the value of the variable is precisely one space. The comment is included here just for clarity. Since trailing space characters are not stripped from variable values, just a space at the end of the line would have the same effect (but be rather hard to read). If you put whitespace at the end of a variable value, it is a good idea to put a comment like that at the end of the line to make your intent clear. Conversely, if you do not want any whitespace characters at the end of your variable value, you must remember not to put a random comment on the end of the line after some whitespace, such as this:\n\nHere the value of the variable is (with four trailing spaces), which was probably not the intention. (Imagine something like with this definition!)\n\nThere is another assignment operator for variables, . This is called a conditional variable assignment operator, because it only has an effect if the variable is not yet defined. This statement:\n\nis exactly equivalent to this (see section The Function):\n\nNote that a variable set to an empty value is still defined, so will not set that variable.\n\nThis section describes some advanced features you can use to reference variables in more flexible ways.\n\nA substitution reference substitutes the value of a variable with alterations that you specify. It has the form (or ) and its meaning is to take the value of the variable , replace every at the end of a word with in that value, and substitute the resulting string.\n\nWhen we say \"at the end of a word\", we mean that must appear either followed by whitespace or at the end of the value in order to be replaced; other occurrences of in the value are unaltered. For example:\n\nA substitution reference is actually an abbreviation for use of the expansion function (see section Functions for String Substitution and Analysis). We provide substitution references as well as for compatibility with other implementations of .\n\nAnother type of substitution reference lets you use the full power of the function. It has the same form described above, except that now must contain a single character. This case is equivalent to . See section Functions for String Substitution and Analysis, for a description of the function.\n\nComputed variable names are a complicated concept needed only for sophisticated makefile programming. For most purposes you need not consider them, except to know that making a variable with a dollar sign in its name might have strange results. However, if you are the type that wants to understand everything, or you are actually interested in what they do, read on.\n\nVariables may be referenced inside the name of a variable. This is called a computed variable name or a nested variable reference. For example,\n\ndefines as : the inside expands to , so expands to which in turn expands to . Here the name of the variable to reference is not stated explicitly; it is computed by expansion of . The reference here is nested within the outer variable reference.\n\nThe previous example shows two levels of nesting, but any number of levels is possible. For example, here are three levels:\n\nHere the innermost expands to , so expands to which in turn expands to ; now we have , which becomes .\n\nReferences to recursively-expanded variables within a variable name are reexpanded in the usual fashion. For example:\n\ndefines as : becomes which becomes which becomes .\n\nNested variable references can also contain modified references and function invocations (see section Functions for Transforming Text), just like any other reference. For example, using the function (see section Functions for String Substitution and Analysis):\n\neventually defines as . It is doubtful that anyone would ever want to write a nested reference as convoluted as this one, but it works: expands to which becomes . This gets the value from and changes it by substitution to , so that the entire string becomes , a simple variable reference whose value is .\n\nA computed variable name need not consist entirely of a single variable reference. It can contain several variable references, as well as some invariant text. For example,\n\nwill give the same value as , , or depending on the settings of and .\n\nComputed variable names can also be used in substitution references:\n\ndefines as either or , depending on the value of .\n\nThe only restriction on this sort of use of nested variable references is that they cannot specify part of the name of a function to be called. This is because the test for a recognized function name is done before the expansion of nested references. For example,\n\nattempts to give the value of the variable or , rather than giving as the argument to either the or the function. This restriction could be removed in the future if that change is shown to be a good idea.\n\nYou can also use computed variable names in the left-hand side of a variable assignment, or in a directive, as in:\n\nThis example defines the variables , , and .\n\nNote that nested variable references are quite different from recursively expanded variables (see section The Two Flavors of Variables), though both are used together in complex ways when doing makefile programming.\n\nHow Variables Get Their Values\n\nVariables can get values in several different ways:\n• You can specify an overriding value when you run . See section Overriding Variables.\n• You can specify a value in the makefile, either with an assignment (see section Setting Variables) or with a verbatim definition (see section Defining Variables Verbatim).\n• Variables in the environment become variables. See section Variables from the Environment.\n• Several automatic variables are given new values for each rule. Each of these has a single conventional use. See section Automatic Variables.\n• Several variables have constant initial values. See section Variables Used by Implicit Rules.\n\nTo set a variable from the makefile, write a line starting with the variable name followed by or . Whatever follows the or on the line becomes the value. For example,\n\ndefines a variable named . Whitespace around the variable name and immediately after the is ignored.\n\nVariables defined with are recursively expanded variables. Variables defined with are simply expanded variables; these definitions can contain variable references which will be expanded before the definition is made. See section The Two Flavors of Variables.\n\nThe variable name may contain function and variable references, which are expanded when the line is read to find the actual variable name to use.\n\nThere is no limit on the length of the value of a variable except the amount of swapping space on the computer. When a variable definition is long, it is a good idea to break it into several lines by inserting backslash-newline at convenient places in the definition. This will not affect the functioning of , but it will make the makefile easier to read.\n\nMost variable names are considered to have the empty string as a value if you have never set them. Several variables have built-in initial values that are not empty, but you can set them in the usual ways (see section Variables Used by Implicit Rules). Several special variables are set automatically to a new value for each rule; these are called the automatic variables (see section Automatic Variables).\n\nIf you'd like a variable to be set to a value only if it's not already set, then you can use the shorthand operator instead of . These two settings of the variable are identical (see section The Function):\n\nOften it is useful to add more text to the value of a variable already defined. You do this with a line containing , like this:\n\nThis takes the value of the variable , and adds the text to it (preceded by a single space). Thus:\n\nUsing is similar to:\n\nbut differs in ways that become important when you use more complex values.\n\nWhen the variable in question has not been defined before, acts just like normal : it defines a recursively-expanded variable. However, when there is a previous definition, exactly what does depends on what flavor of variable you defined originally. See section The Two Flavors of Variables, for an explanation of the two flavors of variables.\n\nWhen you add to a variable's value with , acts essentially as if you had included the extra text in the initial definition of the variable. If you defined it first with , making it a simply-expanded variable, adds to that simply-expanded definition, and expands the new text before appending it to the old value just as does (see section Setting Variables, for a full explanation of ). In fact,\n\nis exactly equivalent to:\n\nOn the other hand, when you use with a variable that you defined first to be recursively-expanded using plain , does something a bit different. Recall that when you define a recursively-expanded variable, does not expand the value you set for variable and function references immediately. Instead it stores the text verbatim, and saves these variable and function references to be expanded later, when you refer to the new variable (see section The Two Flavors of Variables). When you use on a recursively-expanded variable, it is this unexpanded text to which appends the new text you specify.\n\nexcept that of course it never defines a variable called . The importance of this comes when the variable's old value contains variable references. Take this common example:\n\nThe first line defines the variable with a reference to another variable, . ( is used by the rules for C compilation; see section Catalogue of Implicit Rules.) Using for the definition makes a recursively-expanded variable, meaning is not expanded when processes the definition of . Thus, need not be defined yet for its value to take effect. It only has to be defined before any reference to . If we tried to append to the value of without using , we might do it like this:\n\nThis is pretty close, but not quite what we want. Using redefines as a simply-expanded variable; this means expands the text before setting the variable. If is not yet defined, we get , and a later definition of will have no effect. Conversely, by using we set to the unexpanded value . Thus we preserve the reference to , so if that variable gets defined at any later point, a reference like still uses its value.\n\nIf a variable has been set with a command argument (see section Overriding Variables), then ordinary assignments in the makefile are ignored. If you want to set the variable in the makefile even though it was set with a command argument, you can use an directive, which is a line that looks like this:\n\nTo append more text to a variable defined on the command line, use:\n\nSee section Appending More Text to Variables.\n\nThe directive was not invented for escalation in the war between makefiles and command arguments. It was invented so you can alter and add to values that the user specifies with command arguments.\n\nFor example, suppose you always want the switch when you run the C compiler, but you would like to allow the user to specify the other switches with a command argument just as usual. You could use this directive:\n\nYou can also use directives with directives. This is done as you might expect:\n\nSee the next section for information about .\n\nAnother way to set the value of a variable is to use the directive. This directive has an unusual syntax which allows newline characters to be included in the value, which is convenient for defining canned sequences of commands (see section Defining Canned Command Sequences).\n\nThe directive is followed on the same line by the name of the variable and nothing more. The value to give the variable appears on the following lines. The end of the value is marked by a line containing just the word . Aside from this difference in syntax, works just like : it creates a recursively-expanded variable (see section The Two Flavors of Variables). The variable name may contain function and variable references, which are expanded when the directive is read to find the actual variable name to use.\n\nThe value in an ordinary assignment cannot contain a newline; but the newlines that separate the lines of the value in a become part of the variable's value (except for the final newline which precedes the and is not considered part of the value).\n\nThe previous example is functionally equivalent to this:\n\nsince two commands separated by semicolon behave much like two separate shell commands. However, note that using two separate lines means will invoke the shell twice, running an independent subshell for each line. See section Command Execution.\n\nIf you want variable definitions made with to take precedence over command-line variable definitions, you can use the directive together with :\n\nVariables in can come from the environment in which is run. Every environment variable that sees when it starts up is transformed into a variable with the same name and value. But an explicit assignment in the makefile, or with a command argument, overrides the environment. (If the flag is specified, then values from the environment override assignments in the makefile. See section Summary of Options. But this is not recommended practice.)\n\nThus, by setting the variable in your environment, you can cause all C compilations in most makefiles to use the compiler switches you prefer. This is safe for variables with standard or conventional meanings because you know that no makefile will use them for other things. (But this is not totally reliable; some makefiles set explicitly and therefore are not affected by the value in the environment.)\n\nWhen is invoked recursively, variables defined in the outer invocation can be passed to inner invocations through the environment (see section Recursive Use of ). By default, only variables that came from the environment or the command line are passed to recursive invocations. You can use the directive to pass other variables. See section Communicating Variables to a Sub- , for full details.\n\nOther use of variables from the environment is not recommended. It is not wise for makefiles to depend for their functioning on environment variables set up outside their control, since this would cause different users to get different results from the same makefile. This is against the whole purpose of most makefiles.\n\nSuch problems would be especially likely with the variable , which is normally present in the environment to specify the user's choice of interactive shell. It would be very undesirable for this choice to affect . So ignores the environment value of (except on MS-DOS and MS-Windows, where is usually not set. See section Command Execution.)\n\nVariable values in are usually global; that is, they are the same regardless of where they are evaluated (unless they're reset, of course). One exception to that is automatic variables (see section Automatic Variables).\n\nThe other exception is target-specific variable values. This feature allows you to define different values for the same variable, based on the target that is currently building. As with automatic variables, these values are only available within the context of a target's command script (and in other target-specific assignments).\n\nSet a target-specific variable value like this:\n\nor like this:\n\nMultiple values create a target-specific variable value for each member of the target list individually.\n\nThe can be any valid form of assignment; recursive ( ), static ( ), appending ( ), or conditional ( ). All variables that appear within the are evaluated within the context of the target: thus, any previously-defined target-specific variable values will be in effect. Note that this variable is actually distinct from any \"global\" value: the two variables do not have to have the same flavor (recursive vs. static).\n\nTarget-specific variables have the same priority as any other makefile variable. Variables provided on the command-line (and in the environment if the option is in force) will take precedence. Specifying the directive will allow the target-specific variable value to be preferred.\n\nThere is one more special feature of target-specific variables: when you define a target-specific variable, that variable value is also in effect for all prerequisites of this target (unless those prerequisites override it with their own target-specific variable value). So, for example, a statement like this:\n\nwill set to in the command script for , but it will also set to in the command scripts that create , , and , and any command scripts which create their prerequisites.\n\nIn addition to target-specific variable values (see section Target-specific Variable Values), GNU supports pattern-specific variable values. In this form, a variable is defined for any target that matches the pattern specified. Variables defined in this way are searched after any target-specific variables defined explicitly for that target, and before target-specific variables defined for the parent target.\n\nSet a pattern-specific variable value like this:\n\nor like this:\n\nwhere is a %-pattern. As with target-specific variable values, multiple values create a pattern-specific variable value for each pattern individually. The can be any valid form of assignment. Any command-line variable setting will take precedence, unless is specified.\n\nwill assign the value of for all targets matching the pattern .\n\nGo to the first, previous, next, last section, table of contents."

        "document": "As John Bollinger pointed out in the comments, you should probably name either the sources or the object files explicitly. Not doing so is less safe, less predictable, and the price you pay in makefile complexity isn't even worth it.\n\nTo circumvent the complexity, you would have to have all of your header files, source files, object files, and output files in the same folder, which isn't great. This would, however, allow you to simply use the function. Otherwise you would have to chain a series of calls to first get all of the source files in the directory, use the function to strip the directory part of the name, and then use the function to do a switcheroo on the filename extension. That would look something like this:\n\nI personally prefer listing all the object files explicitly, but this will do what you want.\n\nAs an aside, the reason you need the function specifically is because while wildcards will generally work as expected in rules and targets, you're using it in a variable assignment, where it is being taken literally. If you set to and echo the variable, you get this:\n\nRunning the whole makefile gives the following error:\n\nThere are no object files in the directory currently, so using the wildcard function in the assignment results in echoing out nothing, which is the usual behavior. I echoed the names of all the object files in the directory: none.\n\nWhat I like to do is list the object files like this:\n\nThen, having previously set the variable like this:\n\nI included the additional target, because a) I like seeing what the compiler (and occasionally the preprocessor) are doing before the linker is invoked, and b) hopefully it helps modularize your goals somewhat.\n\nHaving hopefully answered the main question, I do have some suggestions on your makefile. You should really stick to the convention of naming the C compiler variable and the C++ compiler , especially if you want to publish your code for others to use. Your users will expect to be able to configure the compilation settings for the project when they build it (maybe they don't have or use g++), and they'll be in for a surprise when they keep changing the variable to no avail.\n\nWhile a makefile for a toy project is short, they can get pretty unwieldy pretty fast, especially with test code, installation directives, etc., so making your users have to for all possible compilation directives to hunt down the actual variable will be pretty annoying. Not to mention you're declaring the variable in the makefile, so they can't override the settings. You might want to use for those variables, that way they're only defined if no settings have been set through the console.\n\nIn fact, if you run in the project directory and , you can see the exact commands has built-in to compile C, C++, assembler, fortran, etc. For C++ the command is:\n\nSince your users can configure those flags though, make sure your mandatory directories aren't in . That variable is for optional libraries' include directories, in case your application allows users to compile with additional functionality if they have a specific library installed.\n\nThe linker command is , where is the linker variable your users will also expect to be able to configure.\n\nAll of this really starts to matter once your projects start gaining size and complexity. Large projects will usually have nested subfolders and a top-level makefile will call each nested makefile recursively, and this is when sticking to a clear, well-defined convention starts to really matter.\n\nWriting good makefiles takes practice, but it can be super rewarding. I've seen some truly masterful ones, none of them written by me, unfortunately. Hopefully this helps somewhat, though; for me it always helps to know why things are done they way they are, from a technical standpoint, before I really understand and embrace accepted practices."

        "document": "I built this guide because I could never quite wrap my head around Makefiles. They seemed awash with hidden rules and esoteric symbols, and asking simple questions didn’t yield simple answers. To solve this, I sat down for several weekends and read everything I could about Makefiles. I've condensed the most critical knowledge into this guide. Each topic has a brief description and a self contained example that you can run yourself.\n\nIf you mostly understand Make, consider checking out the Makefile Cookbook, which has a template for medium sized projects with ample comments about what each part of the Makefile is doing.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you are able to slay the confusing world of Makefiles!\n\nMakefiles are used to help decide which parts of a large program need to be recompiled. In the vast majority of cases, C or C++ files are compiled. Other languages typically have their own tools that serve a similar purpose as Make. Make can also be used beyond compilation too, when you need a series of instructions to run depending on what files have changed. This tutorial will focus on the C/C++ compilation use case.\n\nHere's an example dependency graph that you might build with Make. If any file's dependencies changes, then the file will get recompiled:\n\nWhat alternatives are there to Make?\n\nPopular C/C++ alternative build systems are SCons, CMake, Bazel, and Ninja. Some code editors like Microsoft Visual Studio have their own built in build tools. For Java, there's Ant, Maven, and Gradle. Other languages like Go, Rust, and TypeScript have their own build tools.\n\nInterpreted languages like Python, Ruby, and raw Javascript don't require an analogue to Makefiles. The goal of Makefiles is to compile whatever files need to be compiled, based on what files have changed. But when files in interpreted languages change, nothing needs to get recompiled. When the program runs, the most recent version of the file is used.\n\nThe versions and types of Make\n\nThere are a variety of implementations of Make, but most of this guide will work on whatever version you're using. However, it's specifically written for GNU Make, which is the standard implementation on Linux and MacOS. All the examples work for Make versions 3 and 4, which are nearly equivalent other than some esoteric differences.\n\nTo run these examples, you'll need a terminal and \"make\" installed. For each example, put the contents in a file called , and in that directory run the command . Let's start with the simplest of Makefiles:\n\nHere is the output of running the above example:\n\nThat's it! If you're a bit confused, here's a video that goes through these steps, along with describing the basic structure of Makefiles.\n\nA Makefile consists of a set of rules. A rule generally looks like this:\n• The targets are file names, separated by spaces. Typically, there is only one per rule.\n• The commands are a series of steps typically used to make the target(s). These need to start with a tab character, not spaces.\n• The prerequisites are also file names, separated by spaces. These files need to exist before the commands for the target are run. These are also called dependencies\n\nLet's start with a hello world example:\n\nThere's already a lot to take in here. Let's break it down:\n• We have one target called\n• This target has two commands\n• This target has no prerequisites\n\nWe'll then run . As long as the file does not exist, the commands will run. If does exist, no commands will run.\n\nIt's important to realize that I'm talking about as both a target and a file. That's because the two are directly tied together. Typically, when a target is run (aka when the commands of a target are run), the commands will create a file with the same name as the target. In this case, the target does not create the file.\n\nLet's create a more typical Makefile - one that compiles a single C file. But before we do, make a file called that has the following contents:\n\nThen create the Makefile (called , as always):\n\nThis time, try simply running . Since there's no target supplied as an argument to the command, the first target is run. In this case, there's only one target ( ). The first time you run this, will be created. The second time, you'll see make: 'blah' is up to date . That's because the file already exists. But there's a problem: if we modify and then run , nothing gets recompiled.\n\nWe solve this by adding a prerequisite:\n\nWhen we run again, the following set of steps happens:\n• The first target is selected, because the first target is the default target\n• This has a prerequisite of\n• Make decides if it should run the target. It will only run if doesn't exist, or is newer than\n\nThis last step is critical, and is the essence of make. What it's attempting to do is decide if the prerequisites of have changed since was last compiled. That is, if is modified, running should recompile the file. And conversely, if has not changed, then it should not be recompiled.\n\nTo make this happen, it uses the filesystem timestamps as a proxy to determine if something has changed. This is a reasonable heuristic, because file timestamps typically will only change if the files are modified. But it's important to realize that this isn't always the case. You could, for example, modify a file, and then change the modified timestamp of that file to something old. If you did, Make would incorrectly guess that the file hadn't changed and thus could be ignored.\n\nWhew, what a mouthful. Make sure that you understand this. It's the crux of Makefiles, and might take you a few minutes to properly understand. Play around with the above examples or watch the video above if things are still confusing.\n\nThe following Makefile ultimately runs all three targets. When you run in the terminal, it will build a program called in a series of steps:\n• Make selects the target , because the first target is the default target\n• requires , so make searches for the target\n• requires , so make searches for the target\n• has no dependencies, so the command is run\n• The command is then run, because all of the dependencies are finished\n• The top command is run, because all the dependencies are finished\n• That's it: is a compiled c program\n\nIf you delete , all three targets will be rerun. If you edit it (and thus change the timestamp to newer than ), the first two targets will run. If you run (and thus change the timestamp to newer than ), then only the first target will run. If you change nothing, none of the targets will run. Try it out!\n\nThis next example doesn't do anything new, but is nontheless a good additional example. It will always run both targets, because depends on , which is never created.\n\nis often used as a target that removes the output of other targets, but it is not a special word in Make. You can run and on this to create and delete .\n\nNote that is doing two new things here:\n• It's a target that is not first (the default), and not a prerequisite. That means it'll never run unless you explicitly call\n• It's not intended to be a filename. If you happen to have a file named , this target won't run, which is not what we want. See later in this tutorial on how to fix this\n\nVariables can only be strings. You'll typically want to use , but also works. See Variables Pt 2.\n\nHere's an example of using variables:\n\nSingle or double quotes have no meaning to Make. They are simply characters that are assigned to the variable. Quotes are useful to shell/bash, though, and you need them in commands like . In this example, the two commands behave the same:\n\nReference variables using either or\n\nMaking multiple targets and you want all of them to run? Make an target. Since this is the first rule listed, it will run by default if is called without specifying a target.\n\nWhen there are multiple targets for a rule, the commands will be run for each target. is an automatic variable that contains the target name.\n\nBoth and are called wildcards in Make, but they mean entirely different things. searches your filesystem for matching filenames. I suggest that you always wrap it in the function, because otherwise you may fall into a common pitfall described below.\n\nmay be used in the target, prerequisites, or in the function.\n\nDanger: may not be directly used in a variable definitions\n\nDanger: When matches no files, it is left as it is (unless run in the function)\n\nis really useful, but is somewhat confusing because of the variety of situations it can be used in.\n• When used in \"matching\" mode, it matches one or more characters in a string. This match is called the stem.\n• When used in \"replacing\" mode, it takes the stem that was matched and replaces that in a string.\n• is most often used in rule definitions and in some specific functions.\n\nSee these sections on examples of it being used:\n\nThere are many automatic variables, but often only a few show up:\n\nMake loves c compilation. And every time it expresses its love, things get confusing. Perhaps the most confusing part of Make is the magic/automatic rules that are made. Make calls these \"implicit\" rules. I don't personally agree with this design decision, and I don't recommend using them, but they're often used and are thus useful to know. Here's a list of implicit rules:\n• Compiling a C program: is made automatically from with a command of the form\n• Compiling a C++ program: is made automatically from or with a command of the form\n• Linking a single object file: is made automatically from by running the command\n\nThe important variables used by implicit rules are:\n• : Extra flags to give to the C compiler\n• : Extra flags to give to the C++ compiler\n• : Extra flags to give to the C preprocessor\n• : Extra flags to give to compilers when they are supposed to invoke the linker\n\nLet's see how we can now build a C program without ever explicitly telling Make how to do the compilation:\n\nStatic pattern rules are another way to write less in a Makefile. Here's their syntax:\n\nThe essence is that the given is matched by the (via a wildcard). Whatever was matched is called the stem. The stem is then substituted into the , to generate the target's prereqs.\n\nA typical use case is to compile files into files. Here's the manual way:\n\nHere's the more efficient way, using a static pattern rule:\n\nWhile I introduce the filter function later on, it's common to use in static pattern rules, so I'll mention that here. The function can be used in Static pattern rules to match the correct files. In this example, I made up the and extensions.\n\nPattern rules are often used but quite confusing. You can look at them as two ways:\n• A way to define your own implicit rules\n\nLet's start with an example first:\n\nPattern rules contain a '%' in the target. This '%' matches any nonempty string, and the other characters match themselves. ‘%’ in a prerequisite of a pattern rule stands for the same stem that was matched by the ‘%’ in the target.\n\nDouble-Colon Rules are rarely used, but allow multiple rules to be defined for the same target. If these were single colons, a warning would be printed and only the second set of commands would run.\n\nAdd an before a command to stop it from being printed\n\nYou can also run make with to add an before each line\n\nEach command is run in a new shell (or at least the effect is as such)\n\nThe default shell is . You can change this by changing the variable SHELL:\n\nIf you want a string to have a dollar sign, you can use . This is how to use a shell variable in or .\n\nNote the differences between Makefile variables and Shell variables in this next example.\n\nAdd when running make to continue running even in the face of errors. Helpful if you want to see all the errors of Make at once.\n\nAdd a before a command to suppress the error\n\nAdd to make to have this happen for every command.\n\nNote only: If you make, it will delete the newer targets it just made.\n\nTo recursively call a makefile, use the special instead of because it will pass the make flags for you and won't itself be affected by them.\n\nWhen Make starts, it automatically creates Make variables out of all the environment variables that are set when it's executed.\n\nThe directive takes a variable and sets it the environment for all shell commands in all the recipes:\n\nAs such, when you run the command inside of make, you can use the directive to make it accessible to sub-make commands. In this example, is exported such that the makefile in subdir can use it.\n\nYou need to export variables to have them run in the shell as well.\n\nexports all variables for you.\n\nThere's a nice list of options that can be run from make. Check out , , .\n\nYou can have multiple targets to make, i.e. runs the goal, then , and then .\n\nThere are two flavors of variables:\n• recursive (use ) - only looks for the variables when the command is used, not when it's defined.\n• simply expanded (use ) - like normal imperative programming -- only those defined so far get expanded\n\nSimply expanded (using ) allows you to append to a variable. Recursive definitions will give an infinite loop error.\n\nonly sets variables if they have not yet been set\n\nSpaces at the end of a line are not stripped, but those at the start are. To make a variable with a single space, use\n\nAn undefined variable is actually an empty string!\n\nString Substitution is also a really common and useful way to modify variables. Also check out Text Functions and Filename Functions.\n\nYou can override variables that come from the command line by using . Here we ran make with\n\nThe define directive is not a function, though it may look that way. I've seen it used so infrequently that I won't go into details, but it's mainly used for defining canned recipes and also pairs well with the eval function.\n\n/ simply creates a variable that is set to a list of commands. Note here that it's a bit different than having a semi-colon between commands, because each is run in a separate shell, as expected.\n\nVariables can be set for specific targets\n\nYou can set variables for specific target patterns\n\nifdef does not expand variable references; it just sees if something is defined at all\n\nThis example shows you how to test make flags with and . Run this example with to see it print out the echo statement.\n\nFunctions are mainly just for text processing. Call functions with or . Make has a decent amount of builtin functions.\n\nIf you want to replace spaces or commas, use variables\n\nDo NOT include spaces in the arguments after the first. That will be seen as part of the string.\n\ndoes the following:\n\n\"Finds whitespace-separated words in text that match pattern and replaces them with replacement. Here pattern may contain a ‘%’ which acts as a wildcard, matching any number of any characters within a word. If replacement also contains a ‘%’, the ‘%’ is replaced by the text that matched the ‘%’ in pattern. Only the first ‘%’ in the pattern and replacement is treated this way; any subsequent ‘%’ is unchanged.\" (GNU docs)\n\nThe substitution reference is a shorthand for this.\n\nThere's another shorthand that replaces only suffixes: . No wildcard is used here.\n\nNote: don't add extra spaces for this shorthand. It will be seen as a search or replacement term.\n\nThe foreach function looks like this: . It converts one list of words (separated by spaces) to another. is set to each word in list, and is expanded for each word.\n\nThis appends an exclamation after each word:\n\nchecks if the first argument is nonempty. If so, runs the second argument, otherwise runs the third.\n\nMake supports creating basic functions. You \"define\" the function just by creating a variable, but use the parameters , , etc. You then call the function with the special builtin function. The syntax is . is the variable, while , , etc. are the params.\n\nshell - This calls the shell, but it replaces newlines with spaces!\n\nThe function is used to select certain elements from a list that match a specific pattern. For example, this will select all elements in that end with .\n\nFilter can also be used in more complex ways:\n• None Filtering multiple patterns: You can filter multiple patterns at once. For example, will select all and files from the files list.\n• None Negation: If you want to select all elements that do not match a pattern, you can use . For example, will select all files that are not files.\n• None Nested filter: You can nest filter functions to apply multiple filters. For example, will select all object files that end with but don't start with .\n\nThe include directive tells make to read one or more other makefiles. It's a line in the makefile that looks like this:\n\nThis is particularly useful when you use compiler flags like that create Makefiles based on the source. For example, if some c files includes a header, that header will be added to a Makefile that's written by gcc. I talk about this more in the Makefile Cookbook\n\nUse vpath to specify where some set of prerequisites exist. The format is can have a , which matches any zero or more characters. You can also do this globallyish with the variable VPATH\n\nThe backslash (\"\\\") character gives us the ability to use multiple lines when the commands are too long\n\nAdding to a target will prevent Make from confusing the phony target with a file name. In this example, if the file is created, make clean will still be run. Technically, I should have used it in every example with or , but I wanted to keep the examples clean. Additionally, \"phony\" targets typically have names that are rarely file names, and in practice many people skip this.\n\nThe make tool will stop running a rule (and will propogate back to prerequisites) if a command returns a nonzero exit status.\n\n will delete the target of a rule if the rule fails in this manner. This will happen for all targets, not just the one it is before like PHONY. It's a good idea to always use this, even though make does not for historical reasons.\n\nLet's go through a really juicy Make example that works well for medium sized projects.\n\nThe neat thing about this makefile is it automatically determines dependencies for you. All you have to do is put your C/C++ files in the folder."
