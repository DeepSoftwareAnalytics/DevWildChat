However, the RO-01 Robots use a modified Rthro base that adds thruster parts connected to the UpperTorso using WeldConstraints. Using simple joints in this way lets you include extra geometry for your characters without changing the original base rig.\n• None At a basic level, NPC animations can be customized by modifying the AnimationId of existing Animation objects within the Animate script poses, or those within the Animations folder. Such a change is essentially an asset swap - to change the finer details, you can create custom copies of existing animations, and to play animations under different conditions, you can edit the Animate or NPC scripts directly. For more information, see Animation.\n\nThe Animate Script in the NPC Model handles animation related configurations and contains the following objects:\n\nThe BodyPart BasePart in the NPC Model represent the various character body parts and contains the following objects:\n\nEach NPC includes a Configuration object within its hierarchy which acts as a container of value objects.

For example:\n\nDetermines if a soldier, based on its AttackMode configuration value, should attack another character. When the soldier's AttackMode is set to 1, other characters must be tagged with SoldierEnemy to be considered attackable. When the soldier's AttackMode is set to 2, all objects without the SoldierFriend tag are considered attackable. When the soldier's AttackMode is set to 3, these tags are ignored entirely and the soldier will attack all characters. This tag is used by the zombie to determine whether it should not attack a character. When applied, the zombie becomes docile toward the tagged character."

        "document": "Welcome to this exciting tutorial on Roblox NPC scripting. In this comprehensive article, we aim to demystify the basics of NPC scripting within the Roblox platform. Brush up your coding skills and let’s dive into a virtual world full of potential and creativity.\n\nRoblox NPC scripting refers to the process of creating and controlling Non-Player Characters (NPCs) within Roblox games. These NPCs can follow paths, interact with players, and perform a variety of tasks, all thanks to the power of scripting.\n\nAs developers, being able to create and manipulate NPCs is crucial to enriching your gameplay experience. Whether you’re designing a helpful guide for your virtual world, or introducing a challenging opponent for players, NPC scripting is an integral part of game development in Roblox.\n\nWhat can I accomplish with NPC scripting?\n\nFrom creating custom behaviors for your characters to implementing advanced game mechanics, the possibilities with NPC scripting are endless. You can make your NPCs talk, move, follow paths, chase players, and even solve puzzles, all adding depth and dynamism to your game creation.\n\nAdditionally, with a solid understanding of NPC scripting, you’ll be stepping into a larger world of game development, encompassing AI behaviors, dialogue systems, and other advanced concepts that can enhance your game’s appeal and replayability.\n\nStarting off, we’ll create a simple NPC. For this example, we will place an NPC model within the Roblox studio and then write a script to make this NPC say “Hello, Player!” when the game starts.\n\nThis script, when run as part of a Roblox game, will make the NPC character say “Hello, Player!” as soon as the game starts.\n\nNow let’s make our NPC follow the player around the Roblox world. We will use the ‘MoveTo’ method, which moves the NPC towards a given location.\n\nThe ‘MoveTo’ function takes a Vector3 value, which represents a position in the 3D space of the game. Because the player’s position changes as they move around, we update the NPC’s target position every frame in order to have the NPC continually follow them.\n\nYou can create greater player engagement by adding dialogue to your NPC. Roblox provides a useful object called “Dialog” specifically for this.\n\nIn this code snippet, we created a new Dialog and attached it to our NPC. When the player selects this DialogChoice, the connected function will be called; in our example, it simply prints a message to the console. You could easily extend this to control more complex NPC behaviors or unlock game achievements.\n\nIn some cases, we may want the NPC to follow a specific path or navigate around obstacles in the game. The PathfindingService can provide a path an NPC can follow.\n\nThis demonstrates an advanced use of NPC scripting in Roblox, allowing us to create dynamic, intelligent behaviours for our in-game characters.\n\nWe’ve discussed how to create a simple dialog system. Now, let’s see how we can enhance this dialogue interaction by adding multiple dialogue choices, which can lead to a more engaging player experience.\n\nThe code creates two dialog options for the player, with each answer leading to a different response from the NPC. In response to the initial question – “Do you like playing this game?” – a “Yes” triggers the NPC to say, “Glad to hear that!”, whereas a “No” prompt the NPC to say, “Oh, I see. Well, everyone has their own taste!”.\n\nAs a developer, when players click on NPCs, you might want something to happen. Roblox has a functionality for this called ClickDetector, which we can harness to make our NPCs interactive.\n\nThe code above creates a ClickDetector, parents it to the NPC, and then sets up a connection to the MouseClick event. The connection function prints a message to the console every time the NPC is clicked by a player.\n\nThe knowledge of NPC scripting can also be used in managing the progress of a game. Given the example below:\n\nIn this script, the NPC will congratulate the player for finishing Level 1 and inform them that they are moving to Level 2.\n\nNPC scripting is indeed a vital tool in Roblox game development. Through it, you can create interactive characters that can greatly enhance a player’s in-game experience. It offers game developers the possibilities of creating various engaging gameplay scenarios and interactions that can help improve a game’s replayability and overall enjoyment.\n\nWhile we already explored a basic version of character mobility, let’s hop on to a more complex scenario: making NPC Climb ladders.\n\nIn the code above, we hook into the ‘ClimbLadder’ function, which is invoked when the NPC needs to climb a ladder. After determining the position of the ladder’s top rung, the NPC is moved there.\n\nWe can use click detectors to allow players to interact with NPCs in more engaging ways. For instance, NPCs could gift items to players when clicked.\n\nIn the script above, upon a click on the NPC, a predefined object named “Item” situated in the ServerStorage is cloned and inserted into the player’s Backpack, followed by a dialogue from the NPC.\n\nNPCs can be made more lively by incorporating animations. For instance, we could implement a waving animation whenever a player is nearby.\n\nThe code above includes the reference to Animator and Animation object. When a player approaches the NPC, it triggers the ‘Approach’ event, and thus the waving animation.\n\nNPCs can be made more advanced by incorporating self-healing capacities. We utilize the in-built ‘Heal’ function of humanoid objects inside ROBLOX for the purpose.\n\nIn the script above, whenever the NPC Humanoid’s health drops below half, the Humanoid will restore its health to full.\n\nWe have another advanced concept of making NPC target and go towards Player and follow them.\n\nThe code snippet above represents an AI-based NPC action where the NPC targets and follows the player around the Roblox world. The ‘MoveTo’ function moves the NPC towards the player, and the ‘RenderStepped’ event makes NPC follow the player as they move around.\n\nRolling up these concepts together, enables you to create more complex, engaging and diverse gameplay scenarios. The power of NPC scripting wields enormous possibilities and we can’t wait to see what you come up with!\n\nWhere to Go Next?\n\nIt’s great that you’ve made it this far – you have taken your initial steps into the dynamic world of Roblox NPC scripting.

        "document": "The BehaviorType of a Dialog determines whether multiple players can interact with a dialog at once. The default value for this property is SinglePlayer.\n\nWhen a Dialog is configured to SinglePlayer, only one player can interact with it at a time. As soon as a player engages with a dialog, other players will not be able to initiate the dialog until the first player is finished.\n\nWhile a player is engaged with a dialog, the other players will see the dialog choices of the player who started the dialog, along with the responses.\n\nWhen a Dialog is set to MultiplePlayers, any player can initiate a dialog at any time, even if another player has already initiated the dialog.

        "document": "Hey, my name is Jack. I’ve collaborated with several prominent Roblox groups and have accumulated a plethora of knowledge to share with you all. In this handbook, I’ll be covering the best practices for general programming and specific Lua related challenges.\n\nI wish I had this resource when I was learning.\n\nClick To See More Do you know what this variable stands for? Well I certainty wouldn’t know what it meant.\n\n Let’s try this again: This is much better. Using ineffective variables names will not only hurt your co-workers but will eventually confuse you.\n\nClick To See More Guard clauses are conditionals that exit a function/loop with a return/break/continue statement. Here’s an example of nested conditionals that can be replaced with guard clauses. function checkUsernameStatus(userNameValid : boolean, premiumSubscription : boolean) if premiumSubscription then if userNameValid then return \"Username is valid\" end end end function checkUsernameStatus(userNameValid : boolean, premiumSubscription : boolean) if not userNameValid or not premiumSubscription then return end return \"Username is valid\" end Notice how the code no longer has nested if statements. In large systems, guard clauses will come in handy when dealing with a multitude of conditionals.\n\nClick To See More Module Scripts are arguably the most useful script object in Roblox. Module scripts allow you to create clean and reusable code. Repetitive code is a thing of the past once you have harnessed the power of module scripts. Some popular frameworks employ the use of module scripts instead of scripts and localscripts (e.g. Knit Framework). Why rewrite code when you can just reference a single function or class? This is a basic example of module scripts. However when combined with OOP, module scripts go to the next level. I’ll leave a tutorial to OOP below as well.\n\nClick To See More Type Checking is extremely useful, even more so when working with bigger projects.\n\n In fact, if you have ever used a roblox service, you have seen typechecking. For example, let’s take a look at tween service:\n\n \n\n In this picture I am creating a new tween, and you can see it showing a typechecking UI when I’m filling out the parameters. The orange underlines resemble variables while the red underlines resemble the type.\n\n This is useful information because you now know what the method’s parameters are looking for.\n\n You can typecheck variables, parameters, and function returns. Now let’s make our own method using type checking: Now, string1 and string2 expect a type of string. And the function expects to return a string.\n\nClick To See More Duplicating your code in multiple places will ultimately lead to confusing code and impossible changes. function findClosestPlayer(plr) local distance = nil local nearPlayer = nil for i, v in pairs(players:GetPlayers()) do local distanceBetween = v:DistanceFromCharacter(plr.Character.HumanoidRootPart.Position) if not v.Character or (distance and distanceBetween >= distance) or v.Name == plr.Name then continue end distance = distanceBetween nearPlayer = v end end Now imagine if this was not a function and you duplicated this code 10 times throughout your script.\n\n First of all, this will cause readability to decrease. Let’s say I need to change part of this code. Looks like we have to change all 10 occurrences of this code. However, If this code was in a function, you could change the code in the function and you would be all good.\n\nClick To See More Documenting your code is important when working on projects with a team or just your self. Imagine you write a complex system. Three months later, you need to make some changes to your code. However, you don’t know how everything works in your system. If your code was documented, it would have saved a couple hours of confusion. Also, did you know that the word “TODO” is a keyword? In studio, the word “TODO” will be bolded.\n\nClick To See More A lot of newer-intermediate programmers will often make the mistake of making memory leaks by having a misinterpretation of connections and memory. Let’s look at the following code: Let’s say you only need this code to run once. After the first time this code runs, it will be useless to you. And, this connection will still be in memory. It’s only until the part get’s deleted will the connection get garbage collected. Let’s go ahead and fix this problem: Now, this touched event is only in memory until the first time it’s touched. For an alternative solution, you can use Event:Once(). This will make sure the event only fires once and is garbage collected:\n\nClick To See More Instance.new is already performance heavy, so utilize this best practice.\n\n Do not use the second argument of instance.new to set the parent of an object. The following code is the worst way you can use Instance.new. It uses the second argument of Instance.new. In this case, it takes Roblox ten performance expensive steps to execute the code. This code queues useless replication changes which is heavy on CPU and bandwidth usage. -- What not to do local newPart = Instance.new(\"Part\", workspace) newPart.Position = Vector3.new(1,1,1) newPart.Size = Vector3.new(1,1,1) Instead, you should always set the parent property last: -- What to do local newPart = Instance.new(\"Part\") newPart.Position = Vector3.new(1,1,1) newPart.Size = Vector3.new(1,1,1) newPart.Parent = workspace This code only takes Roblox five steps. This is the most optimal solution. This code’s property updates are extremely fast. When the object is inserted into the game, it’s in it’s final state. If you don’t set the parent argument last, you will not get the desired performance. In fact, most Roblox core scripts and tools use this bad practice… Set up Instance.new in the following order:\n\n A. Instance.new\n\n B. Assign properties\n\n C. Assign Parent\n\n D. Connect signals For more information:\n\n PSA: Don't use Instance.new() with parent argument\n\nGetService instead of referring to services"

        "document": "Picking up programming and learning it for the first time works just like any other hobby–art, music, sports, photography, etc.–although, it may be difficult to know where to start as a beginner, especially if you’ve never had experience with it up until now. When I was younger, it was very difficult for me to get into programming as tutorials for a younger, completely unexperienced audience was rare. Although there was plenty of content available, I still had a hard time understanding the material or just got lost in the sea of information that was given to me. There are still plenty of places on either Youtube or other parts of the internet where beginners can learn, but I’ve specifically compiled this list so that you have a neat, simple page you can refer to if you feel lost, or don’t know where to go after searching for tutorials. Becoming an experienced programmer from scratch will not be easy, it will take a lot of effort and more importantly time to become an expert. I say this because many developers I’ve personally known, whether rookies or professionals, tend to bail halfway through their project or goal. Do not lose hope when things don’t come as quickly as you expected, patience is crucial. What sets poor and excellent students isn’t necessarily intelligence, but their willingness to put in work and always seeking new ways to become better at what they do. Think of this article as a legend for Lua, similar to the page in a large book that highlight specific terms or character in the book that the reader might not recognize. When you finish this guide, your ability to code things will be limited, but you should have a much easier time understanding tutorials on more advanced topics. Ultimately, I hope this article can help you get started, or at least guide you through your journey through programming.\n\nP.S. I’ve tried to make this tutorial as kid-friendly as possible, if it is still difficult to read or understand, please DM me on any platform and I’ll try my best fix it. Specific examples are appreciated.\n\nChances are, if you’ve ever played a game, you’ve wondered how it was made. How does a sword go from unequipped to swinging in just a matter of seconds? Why? How is this app able to stream the movies I select? How is the website we’re currently on even able to operate?\n\nComputer programming is an essential part of modern life, as it determines and allows for many technologies we use on a daily basis to operate. However, all code is not written in the same way, rather, there are distinct languages, or ways of writing code. In fact, you might already be familiar with the names of various programming languages, including but not limited to JavaScript or Python.\n\nIn this tutorial, we’ll be covering Lua, the official language of Roblox which can be used to create a variety of different games for users to play.\n\nIn this tutorial, we’ll be using a specific format to write, input, and receive the result of our script. To use a format identical to mine, click on View in the upper left side of your screen, then make sure you have selected and have the following settings:\n\nYour screen should look something similar to this\n\nScripts can be inserted almost everywhere, for the sake of keeping this tutorial short, head over to Model on the top panel and browse to the far left and click on Script, which will generate a script that we can use for our tutorial.\n\nPrint is a built-in function which prints out whatever statement you decide to give it. This can be either number or strings, which we’ll cover in this section. You’ll notice that once you launch a script, there is already a print function automatically typed out for you. This code always comes with your scripts, so we’ll erase it to continue with the next step.\n\nType out print in all lowercase letters. If print is typed incorrectly or typed with any capitals, the program will not recognize the command and will not run it. Add a pair of parenthesis after, studio should automatically add the second one. Make sure there is no space in between print and the parenthesis otherwise Lua will not be able to read it.\n\nNext, we need to add a string in-between the parenthesis so that we don’t just print empty space. A string is any character or words inside of a pair of quotes, such as “Hello World!” For our tutorial, we’ll be adding the string “YellowNoobs!” for the program to print.\n\nYou may replace \"YellowNoobs\" with any other text you wish as long as it is in-between the parenthesis (\"\"), the end result should look something like this,\n\nIf you want to include quotation marks in your quote, you can also use a pair of single quotes (’’) and put the double parenthesis, or vice-versa for single quotes to be printed.\n\nPrint also works for numbers and equations, which it’ll automatically simplify in the output. But before we write out our problem, we need to find the symbols needed to get the right answer.\n\nArithmetic operators are basically all the tools we use in programming to indicate a relationship between numbers. This sounds complicated, but it’s just what we call the symbols we use to add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers.\n\nHere are the Arithmetic Operators used in Lua:\n\nNow, we’ll write our equation in-between the parenthesis, and paste it into the command bar once we’re ready to get the output. Feel free to mess around with the operators to get the hang of it.\n\nIf we put our code into the command bar we’ll get 81 instead. This is the answer to the equation, and Lua does this because it’s a simplified version, or answer to the problem we originally printed. An important thing to keep in mind is that Lua completes the math using the Order of Operations, meaning it starts with exponents, then division and multiplication, and finally addition and subtraction.\n\nTake this piece of code for example,\n\nWhile you may be tempted to say the answer is 12, since you add 1 + 5, getting 6 and multiplying it by 2, this is wrong. Instead, you multiply 5 and 2 first, then add 1, getting 11. This is a rule of both math and programming, so practice the concept until you can avoid printing the wrong number.\n\nIn order to combine two or more separate values together, you can use concatenation in the print function. We’ll still use the same format, but will add two periods or dots after each string. Do not place this inside of the string, otherwise Lua will interpret it as part of the string and produce an error.\n\nIf we paste this into the command bar, the output will show us a full statement as if it was a single string, meaning the concatenation was successful.\n\nNow that you’ve learned how to make a script, you’ll learn what variables are and how to make your own. Variables are considered vital because they save a lot of time and save you time and make your scripts simpler to review. They can be booleans, numbers, strings, or practically anything you want to assign a name to.\n\nIf you’re struggling to understand the concept of a variable, you can compare it to a nickname you might give someone who’s name may be too tedious to pronounce. Although it is not their birthname, calling them by their nickname will still get their attention as they’ve been given and called by it before.\n\nBelow, I’ve given an example of a variable. The term “variable” will be used interchangeably with the string “YellowNoobs!” whenever we use it in the script. If we put the variable inside of the print command, it will print the text assigned to it. Since the variable is identical to the string we assigned it, we do not need any quotes around the variable name. If you put quotes around a variable name, Lua will interpret it as a string, and print the actual name rather than the value.\n\nIf we copy and paste the code into the input, the output will print our statement.\n\nIt is necessary that you define your variables before using them in your code. Since Lua reads code from top to bottom, it will not know what the variable stands for when it executes the print function. If we paste the code into our command bar, we’ll get the output nil, which means nothing or no data.\n\nWhenever we define the variable, its scope covers all of the code below in the script. Variable scope is just another word for when the variable can be accessed in your script.\n\nThere are two types of variables which you’ll hear about, local and global. The variables we’ve made in this tutorial so far have been global variables, which means they can be accessed in all code below inside the script. Local variables will be covered later in this tutorial, but in simplest terms, they have a much more limited scope.\n\nVariables do not only have to be named “variable” when assigned to a given piece of code. In fact, your variables have to be different names in order for the program to recognize which variable you want it to use in the script.\n\nWhile you can almost freely name your variables, there are a few restrictions that exist inside Lua.\n\nYou can use:\n\nYou can not use:\n• Capital letters as the first letter of the variable (Not required, but common practice)\n• Numbers as the first letter of the variable\n\nComments are a simple green text that organize and give context to your lines of code, which can be a useful tool for yourself or others if you plan on sharing it.\n\nCreating comments is extremely easy, add - - and then your text after you are finished. It should appear something like this.\n\nIf you want your comment to cover more than one line, insert brackets, with your text inside.\n\nAny text attached to the comment will not be executed by the program, and will only be seen by the reader. This green text is helpful in case you want to find a specific piece of code in your script. Comments are also crucial if you plan on sharing your scripts and want the reader to understand what certain commands do. Besides context, you can use comments to credit yourself for your script, or write out directions that the user who uses your script might want to see.\n\nIf you want to change the settings (such as the transparency, or invisibility) of an object in the workspace, you have to write down the specifics before Lua knows what you want it to do.\n\nSo, if we want to change the transparency of the baseplate, we first need to define that the baseplate is inside game.Workspace, with game being the game we’re working on and workspace being the place where baseplate and the rest of our parts are stored. Then, we write the object we’ll be changing (baseplate) and the setting that we want to change (its transparency), and then assign a value to it. If we want it to be fully invisible, we’ll set the value to one, lowering this amount will make it so that it’s semi-transparent.\n\nIn the end, this should make the baseplate completely invisible if we run the code or play the game. Keep in mind that we can change the properties of object in Studio as long as you define it correctly in the code.\n\nWhen you’re writing a sequence of code that needs to be repeated, it may be a little tedious and also messy to write it out several times. Functions are a tool in Lua that we can use to put lines of different code in, which can be repeated and manipulated a lot easier by us. The functions in this segment are not to be confused with the built-in functions of Lua, such as print.\n\nTo define a function, we need to write function and then assign it a name. Then, add a pair of parenthesis after your function name without any spacing in-between, and press enter. I’ll be naming my function printStuff, but you can name yours differently.\n\nNow, we need to write our code for our function to actually execute it. You’ll notice that when you press enter after writing your function, you’ll automatically get end. This statement is here so that you can end, or close off your function, otherwise Lua would get an error.\n\nI want to print several strings, so I’ll insert the several sequences of code inside my function.\n\nWe now have our function, however, nothing will be happen since we haven’t written the command to execute it. We need to type the function name on the next line, and Lua will print our strings.\n\nNow, Lua will execute our code. If we paste all of the content into the command bar, we’ll see that our function is successful. It’s important to note that just like variables, functions need to defined before we actually execute them in our code, otherwise we’ll just get nil.\n\nWhen we covered local variables previously in our tutorial, I mentioned that the scope of it was much more limited. Whereas global variables can be accessed anywhere in our script after being defined, local variables are limited to a block.\n\nSo what is a code block? An example is basically the indented sequence of code that we see in our function. I’ll attach comments to the parts that are a part of the block of code for a visual demonstration.\n\nYou can also tell if something is a block by the small arrow that appears to the left. If you look closely, the arrow facing down next to function is indicating that the block is being shown, and when it is facing up, it means it is closed.\n\nIf we try to print the local variable outside the block, we’ll get nil since the variable can’t be accessed.\n\nA handy feature of functions is the ability to manipulate the variables with ease. You might’ve already noticed the pair of parenthesis when we define the function, and the two other parenthesis when we execute it. These are the spaces where we put our arguments and parameters.\n\nEvery time we execute a function, we might want to change certain parts of the code each time. Parameters are used to tell Lua which variables (and thus any information) inside the function you want to change. They are established when we first define our function, and are placed in-between the first pair of parenthesis on the same line. Make sure to not define the variable you’ll be changing inside of your function, otherwise the parameter will not work.\n\nNow that we’ve defined the parameter, we need to write an argument for the function to be properly executed. An argument is the value we assign the code when executing it. It comes inside our next pair of parenthesis, and can be changed every time we execute the function separately. We’ll print a string and a number, and the program should treat the argument as the variable in the function.\n\nNow if we put it in the output, the two values should be successfully printed.\n\nArguments and parameters aren’t just limited to a single pair, in fact there can be as many as you want. In order to add another pair, separate each parameter and argument by a comma with the next one you want in your function.\n\nNow if we paste it into our command bar, the output should print both statements in the order we gave them. It is important that you put the arguments and parameters in the same order or you will assign the wrong value to the variable. Also, you always have to define your parameters when you execute your function, otherwise Lua will not know what to assign to the variables.\n\nYou might’ve already noticed that below the option to create a script, there is something called a local script. This tutorial won’t go too in-depth about them, but offer a broad summary about its purpose.\n\nLocal scripts are scripts that only affect the user’s client rather than the server. A user’s client is basically what they see, rather than the whole server. So whereas you might be seeing something, your friend playing the same game as you might see something completely different. In comparison, scripts that affect the server are seen by everyone, and not just the individual’s client.\n\nThe concept is a bit difficult to describe by text, and I still can’t do it justice by talking about it in depth, so I urge you to look at this video by TheDevKing to get a better idea of what local scripts are capable of.\n\nYou might’ve heard this word in math class and it is related. Booleans in scripting are the conditions true or false.\n\nWhen comparing values you’ll get a Boolean as well, although you can simply write true or false too.\n\nRelational operators are the operators used to compare values with one another.\n• Equal to, not to be confused with equal which simply assigns something rather than comparing two values: ==\n• Not equal to, which is true if the values are not equal: ~=\n• Greater than or equal to: >=\n• Less than or equal to: <=\n\nNow, let’s take a look at some numbers and see if they represent a true or false boolean\n\nThe first one is false, since the value can only be greater than, and not equal to the other. The next one is true as the values are equal to one another. The last is clearly false, since 8 is not less than the number 2.\n\nIf statements make it so that specific commands only happen if the condition is met, it will execute the code.\n\nFor example, if 5 > 1 the Output will print “Congratulations” since 5 > 1 is true. If the script said 5 < 1 then the script will not print “Congratulations” in Output.\n\nThis is equivalent to saying true instead and will still print our string.\n\nSometimes, our code needs to be repeated in order to produce an outcome we’re looking for. Loops are statements that allow us to repeat code multiple times. They come in several different forms, which we’ll cover in this section of the tutorial.\n\nWhile loops repeat sequences of code while the statement is true. However, when the condition is false, it will not execute the code block. For example, while a variable is less than a certain value, it will continue to print out a string we decide to give it. This is just one of countless things you can do with a while loop, so feel free to get creative if you’re feeling ambitious.\n\nFor our while loop, we’ll assign a number to our variable, x. Afterwards, we go on the next line and write while. This helps Lua understand that it is a while loop, so that when the condition is true, it’ll execute the code block. The do you see after our boolean is simply telling Lua to execute the block of code that is part of the loop when the condition is true.\n\nIn this code, I defined my variable as 10 and made it so that the while loop would continue to run until it was no longer less than a 100. Each time it runs the code, I made it so that it would add 10 to the variable, meaning that once it ran several times, it would no longer execute the code since the condition is false.\n\nNotice the string being printed after the loop. This is not executed until the loop is finished, so not attaching it to the loop can be used to tell us when the loop is finished.\n\nFor loops are able to loop as many times as the user wants. First, we define a variable for the loop, and assign it to a starting and ending value. The loop will continue to repeat until the starting value reaches the end value. While the amount the starting value increases is by 1, you can change it by adding a comma after the end value. Below, is an example of a for loop.\n\nOur loop will now print 1, 6, 11, 16 all the way until 21 where it will stop since it can not go past 25.\n\nHere is the format for the for loop.\n\nA repeat loop repeats the statements assigned to it until a following condition is true.\n\nUnlike a while loop, it runs the statements first before checking if the condition is true.\n\nWriting break at the end of a loop will end the loop if a condition is true. In the example below, break is used to break out of an infinite loop that otherwise keeps running because it is always true.\n\nThis could also work if instead of true we wrote while x < 200 do. The result would be that the loop would end early, ending when x reaches 100 rather than 200.\n\nYou may also hear the term nested loop, which is used to describe a loop with another loop inside of it.\n\nTables are used for storing large sets of data that you might use while creating your script. With tables, you can access and manipulate the data easy, which can come in handy later on. In this section, you’ll be learning about just a single type of tables, arrays.\n\nArrays are simply a list of values compiled in a table. This can include strings, numbers, booleans, functions–pretty much anything that can be used outside the script. To make an array, start by assigning a name of your own to the table.\n\nAfter this first step, you need to assign the data to the table. Assign the table to the data by adding an “=” in between, and write a pair of curly brackets (the second bracket will be automatically typed for you).\n\nNext, you can place all of your values inside of the array. For this tutorial, we’ll place a few strings and numbers together, but you can add more variety to your table if you’re following along. Make sure to separate each value by adding commas in-between them.\n\nIf we want to print specific parts of our array, we can use the index to get what we want. Each value in our array has an index, or number assigned to it. The first value is 1, second value is 2, third value is 3, etc. To print a specific part of our array, we put our table name in the print function, then follow it up with the index of the value, in-between brackets ([]).\n\nIn the end, this should print out our first string, “Hello World” in the output.\n\nWhere Else Can I Learn About Scripting?\n\nThere are many other places to learn, but the sources listed above have helped me with learning or adapting to Lua.\n\nWhat is the Difference Between Input and Output?\n\nInput is the code given to the engine, while output is the received/finished command. For example, print(“YellowNoobs!”) is a input while YellowNoobs is the output.\n\nStopping exploiters isn’t a beginner issue, it is a little more advanced than what we’ve discussed so far. Throughout your scripting career, you’ll realize that the main reason for exploits is due to poor and weak scripts that hackers are able to bypass.\n\nOne feature that Roblox automatically now applies to all games is FilteringEnabled, which prevents hackers from messing with the server itself. To learn more about how it works, you can watch the following video by AlvinBlox,\n\nWhy does Studio Automatically Indent for me?\n\nTechnically, indenting is not necessary, but it is extremely helpful and keeps your code organized. For example, through indents, you can see where your code blocks are. Not only that, but it looks much cleaner. Writing without proper indentation would give both you and the programmers reviewing your code a headache to read.\n\nHow do I become better?\n\nPractice, practice makes perfect, no exceptions. Learning to program unique things by yourself is always something you should strive to achieve as a developer.\n\nThat’s it, the basic tutorial is now finally finished! Hopefully, now you’ll have a far easier time being able to understand new concepts and can use this as a reference whenever you feel stuck.\n\nIf you have any other questions or feedback, please reply in the comments below, good luck!"

Roblox Studio simplifies the game creation with its easy-to-use interface and extensive tool selection. You can develop a game from scratch using Roblox Studio using the following best practices:\n• You should have a clear idea about the type of game you want to create. Identify the genre, target audience, and USP.\n• Outline the game’s mechanics, story, characters, levels, and progression to help create a clear roadmap.\n• Break down the development process into smaller tasks with specific deadlines. This helps maintain focus and ensure seamless progress.\n• The games in Roblox are scripted using Lua. Learning Lua is the best way to implement game mechanics effectively.\n• Write modular and reusable code to streamline game mechanics and updates.\n• Implement thrilling challenges, rewards, and varied gameplay to keep players hooked.\n• Use high-end 3D models, textures, and animations to improve the visual look of your game.\n• You can grow your game’s user base through promoting on social media, forums, and other community-based platforms.\n\nRoblox is an exciting platform for all age groups to bring their game ideas to life. However, many game creators, especially beginners, encounter challenges that might hinder their progress or affect the quality of their games. Here are some of the common pitfalls and how to avoid them:\n\nOne of the most common mistakes the creators make when navigating through how to make a Roblox game is jumping straight into development without any proper planning. This often leads to project delays and requires more effort to complete.\n• Make a clear outline map that plans out all the game themes, mechanics, and objectives.\n• Create a list of the game’s required assets, including characters, objects, environments, and scripts.\n\nA cluttered or confusing user interface (UI) can frustrate players and make the game difficult to navigate and play.\n• Keep the UI simple and use clear labels and icons.\n• Make sure to add easy-to-navigate buttons and menus.\n\nThe performance issues can hinder the fun of the gaming experience, leading to lag, crashes, and slow loading times.\n• Keep the poly count low for smoother performance.\n\nThe overly complex game mechanics can lower the engagement of the players, especially when the game targets a younger audience.\n• Focus on core mechanics to make it fun and engaging.\n• Increase the game’s difficulty to keep players engaged.\n\nMany creators overlook the storyline, which makes the game feel hollow and lacking in depth and engagement. A good storyline keeps a player hooked until the very end.\n• Allow players to influence the storyline through their actions.\n\nAs you’re now aware of how to make a Roblox game, let’s move forward to have a look at the hardware, software, and additional factors needed for the effective use of Roblox Studio:\n\nWindows: Roblox Studio is compatible with Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10.\n\nMac: Roblox Studio works with macOS 10.11 and later models.\n\nMemory (RAM): It is suggested that 1 GB RAM be used, but 4 GB is preferred for improved performance.\n\nStorage: It should have at least 20 GB of free space.\n\nAlthough online games are a central part of Roblox, with more than half of American children and teenagers under 16 playing by mid-2020, the platform has also expanded into various other types of online entertainment. One instance is when Roblox added private virtual spaces for users to host meetups, social gatherings, and birthday parties during national lockdowns.\n\nDuring the early months of 2025, Roblox observed around 6.5 billion hours of user interaction from players under 13 years old in Roblox games. This marks a notable rise from the 5.9 billion hours of user engagement recorded by the same group of users in the previous quarter.\n\nIf you’re based in Riyadh and want to invest in game app development, you can check out our blog to find detailed cost to make an app in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn terms of the popular game apps, Town RPG Brookhaven is the most widely played game of all time, with over 50 billion visits in July 2025.\n\nMinecraft Vs Roblox: Which One Is the Best Choice in 2025?\n\nInterestingly, Gameplay in Minecraft and Roblox are completely different.\n\nWhile Minecraft is great for playing individually, Roblox offers a greater variety of mini-games and multiplayer features.\n\nIn Minecraft, the focus is on playing alone, so there is little interaction with other players.

        "document": "Given the popularity of games today, it’s no wonder many kids aspire to be game developers and designers. Lua coding is a good choice for those kids interested in game development.\n\nCoding is an exciting world that can lead kids into game development and design. It’s also a good first step whether they want to build games or just learn a new skill.\n\n💻 Prepare your child for success: If you are looking for your child to learn to code, explore our live, teacher-led coding classes. View Programs.\n\nLearning to develop games gives them a sought-after technical skill, but also improves their creativity, problem-solving, and analytical skills.\n\nKids who want to learn Lua with personalized help from live instructors can join our top-rated Roblox summer camp.\n\nThis guide will cover the basics of Lua coding, its features, benefits, and how kids can learn to code in Lua.\n\nLua is a high-level scripting programming language that kids can use to code in Roblox and other platforms. It’s one of our top coding languages for kids because Lua is used extensively in game development to enhance game features, create interactive experiences, and customize game mechanics.\n\nIt was originally created by a team at Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. The word “Lua” (pronounced LOO-ah) means “Moon” in Portuguese.\n\nThis language combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is dynamically typed, runs by interpreting bytecode with a register-based virtual machine, and has automatic memory management with incremental garbage collection, making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping.\n\nThe Lua 5.1 reference manual is the official definition of the Lua language. You can find technical language information in the Lua documentation.\n\nLuau is a language derived from Lua 5.1 that’s designed to be faster, more feature-rich, and more performant. It’s described as a fast, small, safe, and gradually typed embeddable scripting language.\n\nIt was originally created for Roblox in order to handle the growing sophistication of games on the Roblox platform, growing team sizes, and large internal teams writing a lot of code.\n\nSome differences in Lua vs. Luau include:\n• Backwards compatibility – Luau is designed to be backward compatible with Lua 5.1, but it also incorporates features from future Lua releases.\n• Compiler and analysis tools – Luau’s compiler and analysis tools are written from scratch, but follow Lua’s syntax and semantics.\n• Type checking – Luau is dynamically typed by default, meaning variables are assigned a type at runtime, but you can also enable strict type checking.\n• String interpolation – Luau adds a way to define string values that allows you to put runtime expressions directly into the literal.\n\nLuau’s main focus is on stable, high-performance code, while Lua focuses on just-in-time (JIT) compilation.\n\nKids can use either Lua or Luau for scripting in Roblox.\n\nLua is free open-source software, distributed under the MIT license. Anyone can use it for any purpose, including commercial purposes, at absolutely no cost.\n\nGetting started with Lua is fast and easy. Kids have likely interacted with Lua before in Roblox. Your child might be interested in the opportunity to not just play but contribute to some of their favorite games and franchises.\n\nIn our Roblox classes, we use Roblox Studio because it already has Lua set up. It allows students to see coding changes in a visual way through the game, versus just in the terminal.\n\nYou can also install it on your computer from the source with these instructions.\n• Open the zip file and extract the contents to your preferred directory (For example: C:/Program Files/Lua)\n• Next, add the directory where you extracted the binaries to the Windows environment variables (in our case C:/Program Files/Lua)\n• Click on this to redirect you to the Environment Variables Window in the Control Panel\n• Go to the System Variables Section, search for the Path variable, and click Edit. You can then add the path to where you extracted the binaries. Click OK.\n• Now, you can access the Lua interpreter from anywhere in your system. To test this, open PowerShell and type “lua”. The interpreter should now run if you have done everything correctly.\n\nIf you use Linux or macOS, Lua is either already installed on your system or there is a Lua package for it.\n\nHere is a simple terminal session that downloads the current release of Lua and builds it in a Linux system:\n\nPre-compiled Lua libraries and executables are available at LuaBinaries.\n\nKids can also use the live demo to play with Lua if they don’t want to install anything on their computer.\n\nLua is one of the most popular scripting languages for game development because of the many features that make it powerful and efficient. These features are great for kids learning to code because Lua is both simple and powerful.\n\nLua has been around since 1993 and since then it has been used across various industries and applications. It’s able to meet the needs of many diverse fields and has continued to evolve. Lua has demonstrated its reliability and effectiveness in many real-world scenarios.\n\nLua is particularly known for its speed and efficiency. It’s enhanced by JIT (just in time) processing which is designed to be performant and lightweight. This is why it’s been adopted for applications that require quick processing like games and real-time simulations.\n\nLua’s core is written in ANSI C, and Lua has a relatively simple C application programming interface (API) to embed it across applications. This gives it the ability to run on multiple platforms and architectures with minimal effort making it very portable.\n\nLua is designed to be integrated seamlessly, or embedded, into other languages as a scripting language. Developers use Lua to extend and customize the functionality of their programs, without rewriting the codebase.\n\nLua only has 21 reserved words, making the language much smaller and more concise than others. Its standard library is minimal but can be extended with many packages. Because of its simple syntax, this language is easier for beginners to learn and facilitates quick prototyping.\n\nBesides its embedded use, Lua has found applications as a scripting language for game engines like Love2D and Corona SDK, web development frameworks like OpenResty for server-side scripting, and scientific computing. Lua’s flexibility allows developers to use it across different projects and industries, demonstrating its versatility in diverse contexts.\n\nLua coding is fun and engaging for kids ages 8 and up!\n\nLua is powerful, fast, and easy-to-learn so it’s perfect for kids and beginners. While the base of Lua code is compact, it still has similar features to other more complex programming languages. It’s easy to extend Lua with various libraries of additional code. Vice versa, Lua can also be used to extend programs written not only in C and C++, but also in Java, C#, and other languages.\n\nLearning to code benefits kids by helping them learn life skills and building the confidence to conquer any new challenges.\n\nKids ages 8 and up can start learning to code with Lua. It has a low barrier of entry for kids to start learning and will grow with them as their skills improve.\n\nThe syntax is straightforward and reads from top to bottom. It’s similar to Python which was also developed with simple and easy-to-understand syntax in mind.\n\nLua is not as strict as some other languages so kids will have an easier time picking it up and fixing bugs. This makes it easy for both kids and beginners to read and understand the code.\n\nLua also has a strong connection to gaming, which is popular among kids.\n\nThey’re probably already interacting with Lua! In games like Roblox and World of Warcraft. Learning Lua will show kids how code relates to them and their world.\n\nCode in Roblox is written in Luau. In Roblox, you use Luau to create scripts. These scripts give the game sets of instructions on how to give players health points, create a rain of fireballs, or anything else imaginable.\n\nRoblox provides a built-in editor where developers can write and test their Lua scripts directly within the platform, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced developers.\n\nIn Minecraft, Lua is used by a specific mod named ComputerCraft that adds working networked computers and programmable robots (turtles). This mod gives you a pseudo-Linux that runs programs you can write in Lua.\n\nLua is generally considered an easy programming language to learn. As with any coding language, the recommended approach is to provide kids with structured and progressive learning so they continue to grow.\n\nOur coding classes use a project-based approach so kids learn hands-on by building games, websites, and apps. Students are continuously adding new skills while solidifying the skills they’ve already learned. This is the same process you can use for your child to learn Lua. Coding can be challenging, so make sure that learning is fun and engaging for them so they stick with it.\n\nIf your child has no experience, use this process to learn Lua coding:\n\nStart with the basics of the Lua language including variables, data types, loops, and control structures. Kids should understand these concepts and be able to write and express them in Lua code.\n\nHowever your child learns best, they can apply it to their Lua studies. To learn these principles, there are resources like tutorials, classes, videos, and games. To practice writing code, kids can install Lua on the computer, use a text editor to write the code, and run it in the terminal. It’s also possible to run Lua code with no setup using One Compiler.\n\nThere they can practice writing the syntax. Once they know the basics, they can apply multiple coding concepts to a bigger project.\n\nIt’s proven that most kids learn best by doing. So give them hands-on practice to apply the skills they’ve learned with projects that grow with their skill level.\n\nThey should find a project that appeals to their interests and matches their skill level. In this process, they can be creative and or just start by mimicking other projects and features created in Lua. This allows kids to practice the skills they’ve learned while creating a portfolio of their work.\n\nWe usually start with a simple project idea, then expand and add on to that idea. These practice projects can be applied in game development in platforms like Roblox Studio and Love2D. These environments give students instant feedback when they can see their code in action.\n\nEncourage continued learning by making it a game. Gamified learning is effective for motivating kids and adds fun to the learning process. In our gamified coding platform, kids earn badges and points. Plus, they’re entered for prizes for actions like completing homework and advancing in classes.\n\nPlatforms like Codewars offer fun coding puzzles for Lua. These challenges help kids practice problem-solving in a game-like environment, which keeps them engaged. Many platforms give rewards or badges as kids progress, making learning feel like leveling up in a game.\n\nPractice is crucial for learning any programming language. The more kids practice, the more they will progress. Writing code regularly will continuously reinforce their skills.\n\nOne-time classes and camps aren’t a good introduction, but won’t teach your child how to code. Kids require spaced repetition in learning and a progression of difficulty. They should be practicing these skills over time and applying them. By practicing just a few minutes daily or weekly, they’re significantly more likely to retain their learning.\n\nStudents will get a lot of practice through doing projects in a safe place where they can learn from their mistakes. Continued practice takes persistence and as their skills improve they’ll build their problem-solving, confidence, and coding skills too.\n\nLua is currently the leading scripting application for games. These are some popular games that use Lua:\n\nHowever, Lua is not only used in game development. Web apps, industrial programs, and existing software use Lua. These industrial applications also use Lua.\n\nNow that you know more about Lua, challenge your child can write their first Lua script.\n\nIn the 1-week Roblox summer camps we use Roblox Studio because it provides a built-in editor for Lua scripts. It also allows kids to see their code executed in an actual game!\n\nLet’s use Roblox Studio to write our first script. This will make a blinking block that appears and disappears in an obby game.\n• Edit the Part You Want to Add a Script To\n• Get Roblox Studio at https://create.roblox.com/ and click the Start Creating button.\n• In the Downloads folder, click the RobloxStudioInstaller to begin installing the software.\n• Select “Classic Obby” in the templates. You can learn how to create and customize your own obby in just 15 minutes.\n\n3. Edit the Part You Want to Add a Script To\n• In the Explorer window on the right of the screen, open the “Obby Structure” folder in the Workspace by pressing the arrow buttons on the left of the folder name.\n• Right-click on a Part and rename it to DisappearingPart. You can also click on any block directly in the Obby to select it.\n• Hover your mouse cursor over the DisapearingPart, press the + button, and select Script. A new file will open, this is where we add the code for our script.\n• Create a variable called platform\n• Create a variable for the platform called platform, where the value is script.Parent. script.Parent is used to find the object the script is located in.\n\nWe want our part to disappear then reappear. First, let’s add the logic to make the part disappear.\n• The CanCollide property determines if other parts (and users) can pass right through the part. If you set it to false, users will fall through the platform.\n• The Transparency property controls when the pat is visible. It can be a value between 0 and 1, where 1 is fully transparent and invisible.\n• Define a function called appear. This will do the opposite of the disappear function.\n\nWe have the logic to make the part disappear and reappear, but we need to make the part blink slowly.\n• Inside of the loop, call the wait() function and add the number of seconds to wait in the parentheses. We are using 3 seconds.\n\nThe first script is complete, press the play button to see the part blinking!\n\nThis is just one of many features kids can use to customize their Roblox games. It’s very simple and fast, so get creative and start scripting.\n\nKids want the immediate gratification of seeing their work come to life. They can do this by using Lua with a front end program.\n\nEach of these programs uses Lua code and can be used as teaching tools for Lua:\n\nRoblox provides an easy-to-use game editor, called Roblox Studio. This is where kids can create and extend their games using Lua scripts. Lua scripting is integral to building games in Roblox. Scripts can power the gameplay, interactions, design, and user experience. With Lua and Roblox studio, kids can create a unique and dynamic game that they can then publish on all platforms including mobile, desktop, console, and VR.\n\nLove2D is a popular framework for kids to make 2D games using Lua. In Love2D, Lua powers everything including the game logic, graphics rendering, input, and audio. Love simplifies game development using Lua so kids can focus on creating their game rather than dealing with the low-level details. Love is completely free and open source. There is an active community that can help kids when they are stuck. People also post their games and projects in the forum, so kids have inspiration and examples.\n\nSolar2D is a 2D game engine that focuses on ease of iterations and usage. It is Lua-based but can call any native (C/C++/Obj-C/Java) library or API using Solar2D Native. It’s a versatile framework that makes game development efficient and accessible, which is great for kids. It is also free and open source. Kids can develop games for mobile, desktop, and connected TV devices. There’s a free code exchange where kids can search other developer repositories and fork the code.\n\nCoding in Lua is not only fun but beneficial for kids. They’ll learn more than just how to write code. They’ll be able to effectively solve problems and make decisions.\n\nOur 1-week Roblox camp teaches kids how to build games in Roblox Studio and write Lua scripts. Get your child interested in coding with their favorite games. You’ll give them the opportunity to become creators and build the skills that will make them successful in the future.\n\nEnroll in a top-rated Roblox camp this summer to learn Lua coding and game development."
