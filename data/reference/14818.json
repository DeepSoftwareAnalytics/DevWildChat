In a vector notation, this will be:\n\nThe matrix corresponds to a Vandermonde matrix of our variable, but in our case, instead of the first column, we will set our last one to ones in the variable . Doing this and for consistency with the next examples, the result will be the array instead of for the linear equation\n\nTo get our best estimated coefficients we will need to solve the minimization problem\n\nWe can do this directly with Numpy. Let's create an example of noisy data first:\n\nTo solve the equation with Numpy:\n\nWe can use the function from the module to do the same:\n\nAnd, easier, with the module:\n\nAs we can see, all of them calculate a good aproximation to the coefficients of the original function.\n\nIn terms of speed, the first method is the fastest and the last one, a bit slower than the second method:\n\nIn the case of polynomial functions the fitting can be done in the same way as the linear functions. Using , like in the previous example, the array will be converted in a Vandermonde matrix of the size , being the number of coefficients (the degree of the polymomial plus one) and the lenght of the data array.\n\nJust to introduce the example and for using it in the next section, let's fit a polynomial function:\n\nIn this section we are going back to the previous post and make use of the module of Scipy to fit data with non-linear equations.\n\nScipy's least square function uses Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to solve a non-linear leasts square problems. Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is an iterative method to find local minimums. We'll need to provide a initial guess ( ) and, in each step, the guess will be estimated as determined by\n\nbeing the gradient of the cost function with respect .\n\nThis gradient will be zero at the minimum of the sum squares and then, the coefficients ( ) will be the best estimated.

Also, we will compare the non-linear least square fitting with the optimizations seen in the previous post.\n\nHere is the data we are going to work with:\n\nWe should use non-linear least squares if the dimensionality of the output vector is larger than the number of parameters to optimize. Here, we can see the number of function evaluations of our last estimation of the coeffients:\n\nUsing as a example, a L-BFGS minimization we will achieve the minimization in more cost function evaluations:\n\nAn easier interface for non-linear least squares fitting is using Scipy's . uses with the default residual function (the same we defined previously) and an initial guess of , being the number of coefficients required (number of objective function arguments minus one):\n\nIn the speed comparison we can see a better performance for the function:\n\nFitting the data with non-linear least squares:\n\nWe obtained a really bad fitting, in this case we will need a better initial guess.

The argument passed to this function is an ndarray of shape (n,) (never a scalar, even for n=1). It must allocate and return a 1-D array_like of shape (m,) or a scalar. If the argument is complex or the function returns complex residuals, it must be wrapped in a real function of real arguments, as shown at the end of the Examples section. Initial guess on independent variables. If float, it will be treated as a 1-D array with one element. When method is ‘trf’, the initial guess might be slightly adjusted to lie sufficiently within the given bounds. Method of computing the Jacobian matrix (an m-by-n matrix, where element (i, j) is the partial derivative of f[i] with respect to x[j]). The keywords select a finite difference scheme for numerical estimation. The scheme ‘3-point’ is more accurate, but requires twice as many operations as ‘2-point’ (default). The scheme ‘cs’ uses complex steps, and while potentially the most accurate, it is applicable only when fun correctly handles complex inputs and can be analytically continued to the complex plane. Method ‘lm’ always uses the ‘2-point’ scheme. If callable, it is used as and should return a good approximation (or the exact value) for the Jacobian as an array_like (np.atleast_2d is applied), a sparse matrix (csr_matrix preferred for performance) or a . There are two ways to specify bounds:\n• None Lower and upper bounds on independent variables. Defaults to no bounds. Each array must match the size of x0 or be a scalar, in the latter case a bound will be the same for all variables. Use with an appropriate sign to disable bounds on all or some variables.\n• None ‘trf’ : Trust Region Reflective algorithm, particularly suitable for large sparse problems with bounds. Generally robust method.\n• None ‘dogbox’ : dogleg algorithm with rectangular trust regions, typical use case is small problems with bounds. Not recommended for problems with rank-deficient Jacobian.\n• None ‘lm’ : Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm as implemented in MINPACK. Doesn’t handle bounds and sparse Jacobians. Usually the most efficient method for small unconstrained problems. Default is ‘trf’. See Notes for more information. Tolerance for termination by the change of the cost function. Default is 1e-8. The optimization process is stopped when , and there was an adequate agreement between a local quadratic model and the true model in the last step. If None and ‘method’ is not ‘lm’, the termination by this condition is disabled. If ‘method’ is ‘lm’, this tolerance must be higher than machine epsilon. Tolerance for termination by the change of the independent variables. Default is 1e-8. The exact condition depends on the method used:\n• None For ‘lm’ : , where is a trust-region radius and is the value of scaled according to x_scale parameter (see below). If None and ‘method’ is not ‘lm’, the termination by this condition is disabled. If ‘method’ is ‘lm’, this tolerance must be higher than machine epsilon. Tolerance for termination by the norm of the gradient. Default is 1e-8. The exact condition depends on a method used:\n• None For ‘trf’ : , where is the value of the gradient scaled to account for the presence of the bounds [STIR].\n• None For ‘dogbox’ : , where is the gradient with respect to the variables which are not in the optimal state on the boundary.\n• None For ‘lm’ : the maximum absolute value of the cosine of angles between columns of the Jacobian and the residual vector is less than gtol, or the residual vector is zero. If None and ‘method’ is not ‘lm’, the termination by this condition is disabled. If ‘method’ is ‘lm’, this tolerance must be higher than machine epsilon. Characteristic scale of each variable. Setting x_scale is equivalent to reformulating the problem in scaled variables . An alternative view is that the size of a trust region along jth dimension is proportional to . Improved convergence may be achieved by setting x_scale such that a step of a given size along any of the scaled variables has a similar effect on the cost function. If set to ‘jac’, the scale is iteratively updated using the inverse norms of the columns of the Jacobian matrix (as described in [JJMore]). Determines the loss function. The following keyword values are allowed:\n• None ‘soft_l1’ : . The smooth approximation of l1 (absolute value) loss. Usually a good choice for robust least squares.\n• None ‘cauchy’ : . Severely weakens outliers influence, but may cause difficulties in optimization process.\n• None ‘arctan’ : . Limits a maximum loss on a single residual, has properties similar to ‘cauchy’. If callable, it must take a 1-D ndarray and return an array_like with shape (3, m) where row 0 contains function values, row 1 contains first derivatives and row 2 contains second derivatives. Method ‘lm’ supports only ‘linear’ loss. Value of soft margin between inlier and outlier residuals, default is 1.0. The loss function is evaluated as follows , where is f_scale, and is determined by loss parameter. This parameter has no effect with , but for other loss values it is of crucial importance. Maximum number of function evaluations before the termination. If None (default), the value is chosen automatically:\n• None For ‘lm’ : 100 * n if jac is callable and 100 * n * (n + 1) otherwise (because ‘lm’ counts function calls in Jacobian estimation). Determines the relative step size for the finite difference approximation of the Jacobian. The actual step is computed as . If None (default), then diff_step is taken to be a conventional “optimal” power of machine epsilon for the finite difference scheme used [NR]. Method for solving trust-region subproblems, relevant only for ‘trf’ and ‘dogbox’ methods.\n• None ‘exact’ is suitable for not very large problems with dense Jacobian matrices. The computational complexity per iteration is comparable to a singular value decomposition of the Jacobian matrix.\n• None ‘lsmr’ is suitable for problems with sparse and large Jacobian matrices. It uses the iterative procedure for finding a solution of a linear least-squares problem and only requires matrix-vector product evaluations. If None (default), the solver is chosen based on the type of Jacobian returned on the first iteration.\n• None : options for . Additionally, supports ‘regularize’ option (bool, default is True), which adds a regularization term to the normal equation, which improves convergence if the Jacobian is rank-deficient [Byrd] (eq. 3.4). Defines the sparsity structure of the Jacobian matrix for finite difference estimation, its shape must be (m, n). If the Jacobian has only few non-zero elements in each row, providing the sparsity structure will greatly speed up the computations [Curtis]. A zero entry means that a corresponding element in the Jacobian is identically zero. If provided, forces the use of ‘lsmr’ trust-region solver. If None (default), then dense differencing will be used. Has no effect for ‘lm’ method.\n• None 2 : display progress during iterations (not supported by ‘lm’ method). Additional arguments passed to fun and jac. Both empty by default. The calling signature is and the same for jac. with the following fields defined: Value of the cost function at the solution. Vector of residuals at the solution. Modified Jacobian matrix at the solution, in the sense that J^T J is a Gauss-Newton approximation of the Hessian of the cost function. The type is the same as the one used by the algorithm. Gradient of the cost function at the solution. First-order optimality measure. In unconstrained problems, it is always the uniform norm of the gradient. In constrained problems, it is the quantity which was compared with gtol during iterations. Each component shows whether a corresponding constraint is active (that is, whether a variable is at the bound): Might be somewhat arbitrary for ‘trf’ method as it generates a sequence of strictly feasible iterates and active_mask is determined within a tolerance threshold. Number of function evaluations done. Methods ‘trf’ and ‘dogbox’ do not count function calls for numerical Jacobian approximation, as opposed to ‘lm’ method. Number of Jacobian evaluations done. If numerical Jacobian approximation is used in ‘lm’ method, it is set to None.\n• None 0 : the maximum number of function evaluations is exceeded.\n• None 4 : Both ftol and xtol termination conditions are satisfied. True if one of the convergence criteria is satisfied (status > 0).\n\nMethod ‘lm’ (Levenberg-Marquardt) calls a wrapper over least-squares algorithms implemented in MINPACK (lmder, lmdif). It runs the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm formulated as a trust-region type algorithm. The implementation is based on paper [JJMore], it is very robust and efficient with a lot of smart tricks. It should be your first choice for unconstrained problems. Note that it doesn’t support bounds. Also, it doesn’t work when m < n.\n\nMethod ‘trf’ (Trust Region Reflective) is motivated by the process of solving a system of equations, which constitute the first-order optimality condition for a bound-constrained minimization problem as formulated in [STIR]. The algorithm iteratively solves trust-region subproblems augmented by a special diagonal quadratic term and with trust-region shape determined by the distance from the bounds and the direction of the gradient. This enhancements help to avoid making steps directly into bounds and efficiently explore the whole space of variables. To further improve convergence, the algorithm considers search directions reflected from the bounds. To obey theoretical requirements, the algorithm keeps iterates strictly feasible. With dense Jacobians trust-region subproblems are solved by an exact method very similar to the one described in [JJMore] (and implemented in MINPACK). The difference from the MINPACK implementation is that a singular value decomposition of a Jacobian matrix is done once per iteration, instead of a QR decomposition and series of Givens rotation eliminations. For large sparse Jacobians a 2-D subspace approach of solving trust-region subproblems is used [STIR], [Byrd]. The subspace is spanned by a scaled gradient and an approximate Gauss-Newton solution delivered by . When no constraints are imposed the algorithm is very similar to MINPACK and has generally comparable performance. The algorithm works quite robust in unbounded and bounded problems, thus it is chosen as a default algorithm.\n\nMethod ‘dogbox’ operates in a trust-region framework, but considers rectangular trust regions as opposed to conventional ellipsoids [Voglis]. The intersection of a current trust region and initial bounds is again rectangular, so on each iteration a quadratic minimization problem subject to bound constraints is solved approximately by Powell’s dogleg method [NumOpt]. The required Gauss-Newton step can be computed exactly for dense Jacobians or approximately by for large sparse Jacobians. The algorithm is likely to exhibit slow convergence when the rank of Jacobian is less than the number of variables. The algorithm often outperforms ‘trf’ in bounded problems with a small number of variables.\n\nRobust loss functions are implemented as described in [BA]. The idea is to modify a residual vector and a Jacobian matrix on each iteration such that computed gradient and Gauss-Newton Hessian approximation match the true gradient and Hessian approximation of the cost function. Then the algorithm proceeds in a normal way, i.e., robust loss functions are implemented as a simple wrapper over standard least-squares algorithms.\n\nIn this example we find a minimum of the Rosenbrock function without bounds on independent variables. Notice that we only provide the vector of the residuals. The algorithm constructs the cost function as a sum of squares of the residuals, which gives the Rosenbrock function. The exact minimum is at . We now constrain the variables, in such a way that the previous solution becomes infeasible. Specifically, we require that , and left unconstrained. To this end, we specify the bounds parameter to in the form . We also provide the analytic Jacobian: Putting this all together, we see that the new solution lies on the bound: Now we solve a system of equations (i.e., the cost function should be zero at a minimum) for a Broyden tridiagonal vector-valued function of 100000 variables: The corresponding Jacobian matrix is sparse. We tell the algorithm to estimate it by finite differences and provide the sparsity structure of Jacobian to significantly speed up this process. Let’s also solve a curve fitting problem using robust loss function to take care of outliers in the data. Define the model function as , where t is a predictor variable, y is an observation and a, b, c are parameters to estimate. First, define the function which generates the data with noise and outliers, define the model parameters, and generate data: Define function for computing residuals and initial estimate of parameters. Now compute two solutions with two different robust loss functions. The parameter f_scale is set to 0.1, meaning that inlier residuals should not significantly exceed 0.1 (the noise level used). And, finally, plot all the curves. We see that by selecting an appropriate loss we can get estimates close to optimal even in the presence of strong outliers. But keep in mind that generally it is recommended to try ‘soft_l1’ or ‘huber’ losses first (if at all necessary) as the other two options may cause difficulties in optimization process. In the next example, we show how complex-valued residual functions of complex variables can be optimized with . Consider the following function: We wrap it into a function of real variables that returns real residuals by simply handling the real and imaginary parts as independent variables: Thus, instead of the original m-D complex function of n complex variables we optimize a 2m-D real function of 2n real variables:"

It not only provides a comprehensive measure of how closely predictions align with actual values but also emphasizes larger errors, making it particularly useful for identifying areas where models may fall short. In this step-by-step guide, we will explore how to calculate RMSE using the powerful Scikit-learn library in Python.\n\nWhat is Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)?\n\nRoot Mean Square Error is a way to measure the average magnitude of the differences between predicted values (such as predicted outcomes from a model) and observed values (the actual outcomes). Basically it's quantifies how well a model is performing in predicting numeric outcomes.\n\nThe formula for RMSE is:\n• None represents the predicted value for the\n• None represents the actual (observed) value for the\n• None is the total number of data points or observations.\n\nScikit-learn offers a straightforward function to calculate Mean Squared Error (MSE), which can be easily transformed into Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). This makes it simple to evaluate the performance of regression models. Below is a step-by-step guide to calculate RMSE using Scikit-learn:\n\nAssuming we have two arrays , y_true (actual values) and y_pred (predicted values). We will calculate RMSE for this:\n\nFirst, calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) using Scikit-Learn's mean_squared_error function. Then, we will compute the RMSE by taking the square root of MSE.\n• None On average, predictions differ from actual values by approximately 0.6123724356957945 units.\n• None This RMSE value gives a quantifiable measure of how well predictions match actual outcomes, crucial for assessing and improving model accuracy.\n\nLet’s see a complete example using a regression model. We will use the Boston housing dataset to train a simple linear regression model and calculate its RMSE.\n\nWhy Use Root Mean Square Error?\n\nRMSE is preferred over other metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) because it penalizes larger errors more significantly. This makes it sensitive to outliers, which can be beneficial when large errors are particularly undesirable.\n• Intuitive Interpretation : RMSE quantifies the average magnitude of errors in the same units as the target variable, making it easy to understand how far predictions deviate from actual values.\n• Sensitivity to Large Errors : By squaring individual errors, RMSE emphasizes larger discrepancies, helping to identify significant prediction errors that may need attention.\n• Scale Consistency : RMSE is expressed in the same units as the predicted values, allowing for straightforward interpretation in practical contexts.\n• Benchmarking and Comparison : It serves as a reliable benchmark for comparing different models; lower RMSE values indicate better predictive performance.\n• Standardization in Reporting : As a widely accepted metric, RMSE facilitates consistent reporting and communication of model performance across various fields.\n\nWhy is RMSE important in machine learning?\n\nWhat is a good RMSE value?\n\nWhat is the difference between RMSE and MSE?\n\nWhat are the limitations of RMSE?"

        "document": "Today’s spotlight is on Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) – a pivotal evaluation metric commonly used in regression problems. Through the lens of our Production ML Academy, we’ll peel back the layers of RMSE, probing its purpose and practicality across applications such as sales forecasting, energy consumption prediction, and medical data analysis. Let’s also examine how this metric fits snugly into the production lifecycle of ML systems.\n\nWhat is RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)?\n\nThe Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is an oft-employed measure to gauge the prediction errors of a regression model. In essence, it tells us about the distribution of the residuals (prediction errors). A lower RMSE is indicative of a better fit for the data.\n\nIn simpler terms, it’s the square root of the mean of the squared differences between the prediction and actual observation. This measure emphasizes larger errors over smaller ones, thus providing a more conservative estimate of model accuracy when large errors are particularly undesirable.\n\nTo make the concept of RMSE more relatable, let’s explore a straightforward example. We have a model that predicts the daily energy consumption of a building.\n\nHere are some hypothetical data for five days:\n\nBy applying the RMSE formula, we find that the RMSE for the model’s predictions over these five days is approximately 19.49 units. This suggests that, on average, the model’s predictions deviate from the actual values by around 19.49 units, with larger errors being weighted more heavily.\n\nHere’s how we would calculate the RMSE in Python for the data provided above:\n\nWhen you run this script, it outputs: The RMSE of the model’s predictions over these five days is approximately 19.49 units.\n\nTo highlight the difference between RMSE and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), let’s calculate the MAE for the same set of data. The MAE is calculated as the average absolute difference between the actual and predicted values.\n\nWhile both RMSE and MAE measure the difference between the predicted and observed values, RMSE puts more weight on larger errors due to the squaring operation. Consequently, RMSE is more sensitive to outlier values as compared to MAE.\n\nLet’s highlight the difference between RMSE and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), by calculating the MAE for the same set of data. The MAE is calculated as the average absolute difference between the actual and predicted values.\n\nIn Python, this can be done as follows:\n\nOutput: The MAE of the model’s predictions over these five days is approximately 18.0 units. This indicates that, on average, our energy consumption predictions are off by around 18 units.\n\nComparing the two, we can see that the RMSE value is higher than the MAE value. This is because RMSE squares the differences before averaging them, thus giving more weight to larger errors. This makes RMSE a more conservative measure of model accuracy, especially when large errors are particularly undesirable.\n\nRMSE finds its footing in diverse domains where regression problems are at the forefront:\n• Sales forecasting: Businesses often employ machine learning models to predict future sales based on historical data, including past sales, seasonal trends, promotional activities, and more. For example, let’s consider a clothing retailer predicting sales for the upcoming winter season. The model might be trained on features like sales data from previous years, the average temperature, the type and amount of marketing promotions, etc.\n\n\n\nOnce the predictions are made, the business can compare these predictions against the actual sales (when they occur) to measure the accuracy of the model. RMSE could be an excellent metric in this case because it would provide an estimate of how much the predicted sales figures deviate from the actual ones, in the original sales units. High RMSE would indicate large deviations and could suggest that the model’s predictions are not reliable, prompting further investigation and model tuning.\n• Energy consumption prediction: Predicting energy consumption is a critical task for power companies for capacity planning and demand response purposes. Features in the predictive model might include weather data, time of day, day of the week, and historical energy consumption data.\n\n\n\nLet’s say a power company uses such a model to predict the next day’s power consumption for a city. If the RMSE between the predicted and actual energy consumption is low, it indicates that the model is doing a good job and its predictions are trustworthy. However, a high RMSE would signify large discrepancies between the predicted and actual values, which could have significant implications, such as an overburdened or underutilized power grid.\n• Medical data analysis: RMSE can be equally useful in healthcare, especially when predicting continuous outcomes. Let’s consider a model predicting patient recovery times based on features like the type of illness, age, pre-existing conditions, and treatment plan.\n\n\n\nA lower RMSE in this scenario would mean the model’s predictions are generally close to the actual recovery times, indicating a well-performing model. This could aid in efficiently planning post-treatment care and hospital resource allocation. Conversely, a high RMSE would mean the model’s predictions are far off from the actual recovery times, signaling the need for model improvement.\n\nThe Role of RMSE in Model Evaluation and Monitoring\n\nRMSE has a central role in both the model evaluation phase and after the model is deployed, i.e., the monitoring phase. During model evaluation, RMSE serves as a measure to understand the model’s performance. Specifically, it reveals how close the predicted values are to the actual ones. An RMSE of zero indicates perfect predictions, which, in practice, is highly unlikely if not impossible.\n\nIn machine learning, RMSE is commonly used to compare the performance of different models on the same dataset. The model with the lowest RMSE is generally considered the best performer, although other metrics should also be considered for a comprehensive understanding of performance.\n\nOnce the model is deployed and starts making predictions on new data, RMSE becomes a key part of model monitoring. Continually computing and tracking RMSE for the predictions can help in identifying anomalies or a potential “concept drift” – situations where model performance degrades over time due to changes in the incoming data’s distribution.\n\nWhile RMSE is an invaluable metric, it’s essential to bear in mind the following caveats:\n• Susceptibility to Outliers: Because of the squaring of residuals, RMSE is more vulnerable to outliers than metrics like MAE.\n• Scale Dependence: RMSE values are influenced by the scale of the target variable. Thus, comparing RMSE values across different datasets may lead to skewed conclusions.\n\nThrough this guide, we’ve journeyed into the heart of RMSE, its calculation, significance, and practical application across various domains. While it’s a go-to metric for regression problems, it also has limitations and should be used judiciously alongside other evaluation metrics. The intelligent application and understanding of RMSE can significantly augment the effectiveness of production ML systems."

This iterative learning process involves the model acquiring patterns, testing against new data, adjusting parameters, and repeating until achieving satisfactory performance. The evaluation phase, essential for regression problems, employs loss functions. As a data scientist, it’s crucial to monitor regression metrics like mean squared error and R-squared to ensure the model doesn’t overfit the training data. Libraries like scikit-learn provide tools to train and evaluate regression models, helping data scientists build effective solutions.\n• Understand the role of loss functions in evaluating regression models.\n• Learn about the different types of regression loss functions and their applications.\n• Identify the pros and cons of various regression evaluation metrics.\n• Develop the ability to select appropriate loss functions based on specific data characteristics and modeling needs.\n\nThis article was published as a part of the Data Science Blogathon.\n\nLoss functions compare the model’s predicted values with actual values, gauging its efficacy in mapping the relationship between X (feature) and Y (target). The loss, indicating the disparity between predicted and actual values, guides model refinement. A higher loss denotes poorer performance, demanding adjustments for optimal training.\n\nRead about the Loss Function in Deep Learning\n\nSelecting an appropriate loss function hinges on various factors such as the algorithm, data outliers, and the need for differentiability. With many options available, each with distinct properties, there is no universal solution. This article comprehensively lists regression loss functions, outlining their advantages and drawbacks. Implementable across various libraries, the code examples use NumPy to enhance the underlying mechanisms’ transparency.\n\nLet’s delve into the world of regression loss functions without delay.\n\nHere is a list of 13 evaluation metrics\n\nMean absolute error, or L1 loss, stands out as one of the simplest and easily comprehensible loss functions and evaluation metrics. It computes by averaging the absolute differences between predicted and actual values across the dataset. Mathematically, it represents the arithmetic mean of absolute errors, focusing solely on their magnitude, irrespective of direction. A lower MAE indicates superior model accuracy.\n• It is an easy-to-calculate evaluation metric.\n• All the errors are weighted on the same scale since absolute values are taken.\n• It is useful if the training data has outliers as MAE does not penalize high errors caused by outliers.\n• It provides an even measure of how well the model is performing.\n• Sometimes the large errors coming from the outliers end up being treated as the same as low errors.\n• MAE follows a scale-dependent accuracy measure using the same scale as the data being measured. Hence it cannot be used to compare series’ using different measures.\n• One of the main disadvantages of MAE is that it is not differentiable at zero. Many optimization algorithms tend to use differentiation to find the optimum value for parameters in the evaluation metric.\n• It can be challenging to compute gradients in MAE.\n\nCheckthis article about Top 40 Python Libraries for AI, ML and Data Science\n\nIn “Mean Bias Error,” bias reflects the tendency of a measurement process to overestimate or underestimate a parameter. It has a single direction, positive or negative. Positive bias implies an overestimated error, while negative bias implies an underestimated error. Mean Bias Error (MBE) calculates the mean difference between predicted and actual values, quantifying overall bias without considering absolute values. Similar to MAE, MBE differs in not taking the absolute value. Caution is needed with MBE, as positive and negative errors can cancel each other out.\n• MBE is a good measure if you want to check the direction of the model (i.e. whether there is a positive or negative bias) and rectify the model bias.\n• It is not a good measure in terms of magnitude as the errors tend to compensate each other.\n• It is not highly reliable because sometimes high individual errors produce low MBE.\n• As an evaluation metric, it can be consistently wrong in one direction. For example, if you’re trying to predict traffic patterns it always shows lower traffic than what is observed.\n\nRelative root mean square error Absolute Error is calculated by dividing the total absolute error by the absolute difference between the mean and the actual value. The formula for RAE is:\n\nwhere y_bar is the mean of the n actual values.\n\nRAE measures the performance of a predictive model and is expressed in terms of a ratio. The value of RAE can range from zero to one. A good model will have values close to zero, with zero being the best value. This error shows how the mean residual relates to the mean deviation of the target function from its mean.\n• RAE can be used to compare models where errors are measured in different units.\n• In some cases, RAE is reliable as it offers protection from outliers.\n• One main drawback of RAE is that it can be undefined if the reference forecast is equal to the ground truth.\n\nGet to Know More All About Evaluation Metrics\n\nCalculate Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) by dividing the absolute difference between the actual and predicted values by the actual value. This absolute percentage is averaged across the dataset. MAPE, also known as Mean Absolute Percentage Deviation (MAPD), increases linearly with error. Lower MAPE values indicate better model performance.\n• MAPE is independent of the scale of the variables since its error estimates are in terms of percentage.\n• All errors are normalized on a common scale and it is easy to understand.\n• As MAPE uses absolute percentage errors, the problem of positive values and negative values canceling each other out is avoided.\n• MAPE faces a critical problem when the denominator becomes zero, resulting in a “division by zero” challenge.\n• MAPE exhibits bias by penalizing negative errors more than positive errors, potentially favoring methods with lower values.\n• Due to the division operation, MAPE’s sensitivity to alterations in actual values leads to varying losses for the same error. For example, an actual value of 100 and a predicted value of 75 results in a 25% loss, while an actual value of 50 and a predicted value of 75 yields a higher 50% loss, despite the identical error of 25.\n\nMSE is one of the most common regression loss functions and an important error metric. In Mean Squared Error, also known as L2 loss, we calculate the error by squaring the difference between the predicted value and actual value and averaging it across the dataset.\n\nYou Should know Linear Regression in Machine Learning\n\nMSE is also known as Quadratic loss as the penalty is not proportional to the error but to the square of the error. Squaring the error gives higher weight to the outliers, which results in a smooth gradient for small errors.\n\nOptimization algorithms benefit from this penalization for large errors as it helps find the optimum values for parameters using the least squares method. MSE will never be negative since the errors are squared. The value of the error ranges from zero to infinity. MSE increases exponentially with an increase in error. A good model will have an MSE value closer to zero, indicating a better goodness of fit to the data.\n• MSE values are expressed in quadratic equations. Hence when we plot it, we get a gradient descent with only one global minima.\n• For small errors, it converges to the minima efficiently. There are no local minima.\n• MSE penalizes the model for having huge errors by squaring them.\n• It is particularly helpful in weeding out outliers with large errors from the model by putting more weight on them.\n• One of the advantages of MSE becomes a disadvantage when there is a bad prediction. The sensitivity to outliers magnifies the high errors by squaring them.\n• MSE will have the same effect for a single large error as too many smaller errors. But mostly we will be looking for a model which performs well enough on an overall level.\n• MSE is scale-dependent as its scale depends on the scale of the data. This makes it highly undesirable to compare different measures.\n• When a new outlier is introduced into the data, the model will try to take in the outlier. By doing so it will produce a different line of best fit which may cause the final results to be skewed.\n\nRoot Mean Square Error in Machine Learning (RMSE) is a popular metric used in machine learning and statistics to measure the accuracy of a predictive model. It quantifies the differences between predicted values and actual values, squaring the errors, taking the mean, and then finding the square root. RMSE provides a clear understanding of the model’s performance, with lower values indicating better predictive accuracy relative root mean square error.\n\nIt is computed by taking the square root of MSE. RMSE is also called the Root Mean Square Deviation. It measures the average magnitude of the errors and is concerned with the deviations from the actual value. RMSE value with zero indicates that the model has a perfect fit. The lower the RMSE, the better the model and its predictions. A higher relative root mean square error in machine learning indicates that there is a large deviation from the residual to the ground truth. RMSE can be used with different features as it helps in figuring out if the feature is improving the model’s prediction or not.\n• It serves as a heuristic for training models.\n• It is computationally simple and easily differentiable which many optimization algorithms desire.\n• RMSE does not penalize the errors as much as MSE does due to the square root.\n• Like MSE, RMSE is dependent on the scale of the data. It increases in magnitude if the scale of the error increases.\n• One major drawback of RMSE is its sensitivity to outliers and the outliers have to be removed for it to function properly.\n• RMSE increases with an increase in the size of the test sample. This is an issue when we calculate the results on different test samples.\n\nTo calculate Relative Squared Error, you take the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and divide it by the square of the difference between the actual and the mean of the data. In other words, we divide the MSE of our model by the MSE of a model that uses the mean as the predicted value.\n\nThe output value of RSE is expressed in terms of ratio. It can range from zero to one. A good model should have a value close to zero while a model with a value greater than 1 is not reasonable.\n• RSE is not scale-dependent. Hence it can be used to compare models where errors are measured in different units.\n• RSE is not sensitive to the mean and the scale of predictions.\n• RSE does not distinguish between underestimation and overestimation errors, as it only considers the squared differences between y_pred and true values. This means that a model that consistently overestimates or underestimates can still have a low RSE value.\n• Like the Mean Squared Error (MSE), RSE is also heavily influenced by outliers in the data points. A few extreme errors can significantly increase the RSE value, even if the model performs well on the majority of the data.\n• When the RSE value is much greater than 1, it becomes difficult to interpret the degree of poor performance. An RSE of 2 or 10 indicates that the model performs worse than the mean prediction baseline, but the magnitude of the difference is not clear.\n• The interpretation of RSE depends on the performance of the mean prediction baseline for the target values. If the mean prediction itself is a poor baseline, the RSE values may not provide a meaningful comparison.\n• Although RSE is scale-independent in terms of the target variable’s units, it can still be sensitive to the scale of the target values. If the target variable has a small range, small errors can result in large RSE values, making the metric less informative.\n• For regression analysis problems with strictly non-negative target values (e.g., count data or positive values), the mean prediction baseline may not be a meaningful or appropriate baseline for comparison with the independent variables.\n• The interpretation of RSE can also depend on the specific test set used for evaluation. If the test set is not representative of the overall data distribution, the RSE values may not accurately reflect the model’s performance.\n\nThe Normalized RMSE is generally computed by dividing a scalar value. It can be in different ways like,\n• RMSE / maximum value in the series\n• RMSE / difference between the maximum and the minimum values (if mean is zero)\n\nOpting for the interquartile range can be the most suitable choice, especially when dealing with outliers. NRMSE proves effective for comparing models with different dependent variables or when modifications like log transformation or standardization occur. This metric addresses scale-dependency issues, facilitating comparisons across models of varying scales or datasets.\n\nCheckout this Guide to Cross-validation with Julius\n\nRelative Root Mean Squared Error (RRMSE) is a variant of Root Mean Square Error in Machine Learning (RMSE), gauging predictive model accuracy relative to the target variable range. It normalizes RMSE by the target variable range and presents it as a percentage for easy cross-dataset or cross-variable comparison. RRMSE, a dimensionless form of RMSE, scales residuals against actual values, allowing comparison of different measurement techniques.\n• Good when RRMSE is between 10% and 20%\n• Fair when RRMSE is between 20% and 30%\n\nRoot Mean Squared Logarithmic Error is calculated by applying log to the actual and the predicted values and then taking their differences. RMSLE is robust to outliers where the small and the large errors are treated evenly.\n\nIt penalizes the model more if the predicted value is less than the actual value while the model is less penalized if the predicted value is more than the actual value. It does not penalize high errors due to the log. Hence the model has a larger penalty for underestimation than overestimation. This can be helpful in situations where we are not bothered by overestimation but underestimation is not acceptable.\n• RMSLE is not scale-dependent and is useful across a range of scales.\n• It is not affected by large outliers.\n• It considers only the relative error between the actual value and the predicted value.\n• It has a biased penalty where it penalizes underestimation more than overestimation.\n\nWhat if you want a function that learns about the outliers as well as ignores them? Well, Huber loss is the one for you. Huber loss is a combination of both linear and quadratic scoring methods. It has a hyperparameter delta (𝛿) which can be tuned according to the data. The loss will be linear (L1 loss) for values above delta and quadratic (L2 loss) for values below it. It balances and combines good properties of both MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and MSE (Mean Squared Error).\n\nIn other words, for loss values less than delta, MSE will be used and for loss values greater than delta, MAE will be used. The choice of delta (𝛿) is extremely critical because it defines our choice of the outlier. Huber loss reduces the weight we put on outliers for larger loss values by using MAE while for smaller loss values it maintains a quadratic function using MSE.\n• It is differentiable at zero.\n• Outliers are handled properly due to the linearity above the delta.\n• The hyperparameter, 𝛿 can be tuned to maximize model accuracy.\n• The additional conditionals and comparisons make Huber loss computationally expensive for large datasets.\n• To maximize model accuracy, 𝛿 needs to be optimized and it is an iterative process.\n• It is differentiable only once.\n\nLog cosh calculates the logarithm of the hyperbolic cosine of the error. This function is smoother than quadratic loss. It works like MSE but is not affected by large prediction errors. It is quite similar to Huber loss in the sense that it is a combination of both linear and quadratic scoring methods.\n• It has the advantages of Huber loss while being twice differentiable everywhere. Some optimization algorithms like XGBoost favor double differentials over functions like Huber which can be differentiable only once.\n• It is less adaptive as it follows a fixed scale.\n• Compared to Huber loss, the derivation is more complex and requires much in-depth study.\n\nThe quantile regression loss function is applied to predict quantiles. The quantile is the value that determines how many values in the group fall below or above a certain limit. It estimates the conditional median or quantile of the response (dependent) variables across values of the predictor (independent) variables. The loss function is an extension of MAE except for the 50th percentile, where it is MAE. It provides prediction intervals even for residuals with non-constant variance and it does not assume a particular parametric distribution for the response.\n\nγ represents the required quantile. The quantile values are selected based on how we want to weigh the positive and the negative errors. Unlike the squared difference loss used in linear regression models, this loss function is based on absolute differences.\n\nIn the loss function above, γ has a value between 0 and 1. When there is an underestimation, the first part of the formula will dominate and for overestimation, the second part will dominate. The chosen value of quantile(γ) gives different penalties for over-prediction and under prediction. When γ = 0.5, underestimation and overestimation are penalized by the same factor, and the median is obtained. When the value of γ is larger, overestimation is penalized more than underestimation. For example, when γ = 0.75 the model will penalize overestimation and it will cost three times as much as underestimation. Optimization algorithms based on gradient descent learn from the quantiles instead of the mean.\n\n𝛾 represents the required quantile. The quantiles values are selected based on how we want to weigh the positive and the negative errors.\n\nIn the loss function above, 𝛾 has a value between 0 and 1. When there is an underestimation, the first part of the formula will dominate and for overestimation, the second part will dominate. The chosen value of quantile(𝛾) gives different penalties for over-prediction and under prediction. When 𝛾 = 0.5, underestimation and overestimation are penalized by the same factor and the median is obtained. When the value of 𝛾 is larger, overestimation is penalized more than underestimation. For example, when 𝛾 = 0.75 the model will penalize overestimation and it will cost three times as much as underestimation. Optimization algorithms based on gradient descent learn from the quantiles instead of the mean.\n• It is particularly useful when we are predicting an interval instead of point estimates.\n• This function can also be used to calculate prediction intervals in neural nets and tree-based models.\n• It is robust to outliers.\n• If we use a squared loss to measure the efficiency or if we are to estimate the mean, then quantile loss will be worse.\n\nThis comprehensive guide navigated through diverse regression loss functions, shedding light on their applications, advantages, and drawbacks. The article demystified complex metrics like MAE, MBE, RAE, MAPE, MSE, RMSE (the root mean squared error), RSE, NRMSE, RRMSE, and RMSLE, and introduced specialized losses like Huber, Log Cosh, and Quantile.

        "document": "Regression models are a cornerstone in data analysis, machine learning, and predictive analytics. Among the myriad metrics employed to assess model performance, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) stands out as a popular and robust method for quantifying prediction errors. In this guide, we will demystify RMSE by exploring its fundamentals, unveiling the mathematical reasoning behind its calculation, discussing its critical role in regression analysis, and offering best practices for leveraging RMSE to effectively refine model performance.\n\nRMSE is integral in comparing different models, tuning parameters, and understanding error distributions. Whether you are an experienced data scientist or just venturing into the world of predictive modeling, this comprehensive guide aims to provide clarity on the inner workings of RMSE and its practical applications.\n\nBefore diving into detailed calculations and applications, it is important to understand what RMSE is, why it matters, and the intuition behind this metric.\n\nWhat is RMSE and Why It Matters\n\nThe Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is a metric used to measure the average magnitude of the prediction error, calculated as the square root of the average squared differences between the predicted and actual values. In simpler terms, RMSE provides a measure of how much the predictions deviate from the true values on average.\n\nMathematically, if we have a set of observed values y1​,y2​,…,yn​ and predicted values y^​1​,y^​2​,…,y^​n​, the RMSE is defined as: RMSE=n1​i=1∑n​(yi​−y^​i​)2 ​\n\nThe value of RMSE is expressed in the same units as the output variable and thus can be directly interpreted in the context of the problem. Smaller RMSE values indicate a better fit, suggesting that the model’s predictions are relatively close to the actual data.\n\nThe Basic Intuition Behind the RMSE Metric\n\nThe intuition of RMSE lies in the treatment of error differences. By squaring the differences between predicted and actual values, we amplify larger errors, making RMSE highly sensitive to outliers. After averaging these squared errors, taking the square root returns the scale of the error to its original unit, thus yielding a metric that represents the typical error magnitude.\n\nThis process is crucial because it penalizes large deviations more than smaller ones, pushing model refinement efforts toward minimizing significant errors. For example, when comparing two models, the one with the lower RMSE generally produces predictions that are more accurate overall—even when the error distribution is skewed by a few outlier predictions.\n\nRMSE is extensively used in model evaluation for several reasons:\n• Interpretability: Since RMSE is in the same unit as the target variable, stakeholders can easily grasp what the metric means in practical terms.\n• Sensitivity to Outliers: The squaring of residuals helps highlight models that occasionally produce large errors, an important factor in critical applications.\n• Benchmarking: When comparing multiple regression models, RMSE serves as a quantitative measure to decide which model best captures the underlying data patterns.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that while RMSE provides a straightforward way to understand average error magnitude, it should be interpreted along with other metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and coefficient of determination (R²) for a complete picture of model performance.\n\nThe calculation of RMSE is straightforward but warrants a detailed breakdown to ensure that its intuitive appeal is backed by a solid mathematical foundation. Having an in-depth understanding of the calculation steps can aid in debugging model performance issues and refining prediction algorithms.\n\nLet’s revisit the formula for RMSE: RMSE=n1​i=1∑n​(yi​−y^​i​)2 ​ where:\n• is the number of observations.\n• represents the true value for observation .\n• represents the predicted value for observation .\n\nThe process for calculating RMSE involves several key steps:\n• Calculate Residuals: Compute the difference between the actual and predicted values for each instance.\n• Square the Residuals: This ensures that the errors are non-negative and places a higher penalty on larger errors.\n• Average the Squared Errors: Sum all the squared errors and calculate the mean. This gives the Mean Squared Error (MSE).\n• Take the Square Root: Finally, the square root of the MSE brings the metric back to the original unit of measurement.\n\nThis sequence of steps emphasizes the importance of both the magnitude and frequency of errors, providing a balanced metric that is highly sensitive to large deviations.\n\nLet’s consider a simple example. Suppose we have a dataset with 5 observations. The true values and predicted values are as follows:\n\nThis example illustrates how to methodically compute RMSE, reinforcing its intuitive interpretation as a measurement of average prediction error.\n\nUnderstanding the scale and context of the computed RMSE is essential:\n• Comparative Analysis: A lower RMSE indicates better performance, but it must be compared to a baseline or against other models.\n• Units Matter: Because RMSE is in the same units as the target variable, its absolute value needs to be interpreted in the context of the data’s scale. For instance, an RMSE of 5 may be acceptable in predicting house prices (in thousands of dollars) but might be too high for predicting test scores.\n• Error Distribution: RMSE does not differentiate between over-predictions and under-predictions. It is the magnitude of errors that matters, and as such, it is sensitive to outliers.\n\nIn the realm of regression analysis, RMSE serves as a dynamic tool to quantify model accuracy and to guide the process of model selection and refinement.\n\nRMSE is a direct measurement of how accurately a model predicts the outcome variable. It helps in assessing model fitness in several ways:\n• Performance Metric: RMSE provides a single, aggregated measure that succinctly represents the average error across predictions.\n• Optimization Goal: Many regression techniques, like linear regression, use the minimization of the mean squared error (and by extension RMSE) as the optimization criterion during training.\n• Feedback for Model Tuning: High RMSE values suggest that the model may be underfitting or overfitting the data, indicating potential areas for improvement such as feature engineering, model selection, or parameter tuning.\n\nWhen using RMSE to assess model fitness, it is crucial to keep in mind the inherent trade-offs. For example, while a low RMSE indicates high accuracy on the training data, it does not necessarily guarantee generalization on unseen data unless cross-validation techniques are employed.\n\nOne of the standout advantages of RMSE is its ability to facilitate comparisons:\n• Benchmarking: If multiple models are being evaluated on the same dataset, the one with the lowest RMSE is often considered to have superior predictive performance.\n• Model Complexity Trade-Offs: Sometimes a simple model might have a slightly higher RMSE compared to a very complex model. However, the increased complexity might not justify the marginal improvement in RMSE if the simpler model offers better interpretability and generalizability.\n• Hyperparameter Tuning: By monitoring RMSE during hyperparameter tuning, practitioners can decide on optimal model configurations that minimize errors and improve overall performance.\n\nA holistic model comparison should include other metrics—such as MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and R²—to ensure that reliance on a single metric does not obscure the full spectrum of model behavior.\n\nLet’s consider a few scenarios where RMSE plays a significant role:\n• House Price Prediction: In real estate, regression models are used to predict house prices based on features like location, square footage, and age of the property. Here, RMSE quantifies the average difference between predicted sale prices and actual prices. A smaller RMSE would signal a model that reliably estimates market trends, helping buyers, sellers, and financial institutions make informed decisions.\n• Weather Forecasting: Meteorological models often use RMSE to assess accuracy in temperature, precipitation, and other weather-related predictions. Given the high stakes in weather forecasting, ensuring that the average error is minimized is key to improving model reliability and public trust.\n• Demand Forecasting for Inventory Management: Companies use regression models to predict product demand, managing supply chain logistics based on these forecasts. RMSE aids in understanding the typical deviation between forecasted demand and actual sales, thereby helping companies optimize their inventory levels and reduce costs associated with overstocking or stockouts.\n\nIn each of these cases, RMSE is not only a diagnostic tool but also a quantitative benchmark that drives decision-making processes. Incorporating RMSE into the model evaluation pipeline ensures that prediction errors are consistently monitored and mitigated.\n\nWhile RMSE provides a clear measure of prediction error, it also offers insights into how model performance can be optimized through careful adjustments. Here are some proven strategies to enhance model performance using RMSE feedback.\n\nEffective regression models require fine-tuning of parameters to achieve an optimal balance between bias and variance. RMSE serves as an essential feedback mechanism in this tuning process. Consider these approaches:\n• Regularization Techniques: Methods such as Ridge and Lasso regression help in constraining the model coefficients. As a consequence, regularization can reduce overfitting, thereby lowering RMSE on unseen data.\n• Cross-Validation: Using techniques such as k-fold cross-validation ensures that RMSE is computed over different subsets of data, providing a robust estimate of model performance and guiding parameter tuning.\n• Grid Search and Random Search: When optimizing hyperparameters, systematically evaluating RMSE across a range of settings allows practitioners to pinpoint the configuration that minimizes error.\n\nIntegrating RMSE feedback into the parameter optimization process helps in devising models that perform consistently well across both training and validation datasets.\n\nModel performance is dynamic, particularly in real-world applications where data distributions may shift over time. Regular evaluation using RMSE is crucial to ensure continued model accuracy:\n• Scheduled Model Retraining: Regularly updating the model with new data and monitoring RMSE can help detect degradation in predictive performance. This proactive approach allows for timely adjustments to maintain high standards of prediction accuracy.\n• Monitoring Trends: Tracking RMSE trends over time can reveal subtle shifts in model behavior, such as a gradual increase in error which might indicate model drift or changing data patterns.\n• Automated Alert Systems: By setting thresholds for acceptable RMSE values, organizations can implement automated alerts that signal when model performance deviates beyond acceptable limits, prompting further investigation or retraining.\n\nData feedback loops are mechanisms by which models are continuously refined as new data becomes available. RMSE plays a central role in these loops by acting as an objective measure of performance improvement:\n• Incremental Learning: Updating models incrementally as new data is captured helps in keeping RMSE low. This is particularly valuable in fast-changing environments where models must adapt quickly.\n• Error Analysis and Correction: Systematically analyzing instances where prediction errors (and consequently high RMSE components) occur can uncover underlying patterns or biases in the data. Addressing these issues—whether through feature engineering, data augmentation, or algorithmic adjustments—can lead to significant improvements in model performance.\n• Feedback Integration: Incorporating expert or user feedback alongside RMSE measurements can further enhance model refinement. For example, domain experts might identify specific scenarios where errors are more pronounced, prompting targeted interventions that ultimately lower RMSE.\n\nWhen integrated into a continuous improvement framework, RMSE-driven feedback loops enable organizations to adapt their predictive models to evolving conditions, ensuring long-term accuracy and reliability.\n\nThe Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is far more than just a metric—it is a powerful lens through which we can evaluate and enhance regression models. By understanding its fundamentals, meticulously computing its value, and interpreting its implications, data scientists and analysts can make informed decisions that significantly improve model performance.\n\nThis guide has walked you through:\n• The fundamentals of RMSE, including why it matters and the intuition behind its calculation.\n• A step-by-step explanation of the RMSE formula, enriched by clear examples and mathematical details.\n• The critical role that RMSE plays in assessing model fitness and comparing different regression approaches across a variety of real-world applications.\n• Best practices for optimizing model parameters, routinely evaluating performance, and integrating continuous data feedback loops to achieve and maintain high predictive accuracy.\n\nFor practitioners, the take-home message is simple: Regularly monitor and strive to minimize RMSE within your regression models. The quantitative insights provided by RMSE not only act as a benchmark for current model performance but also highlight areas for future enhancements. In a rapidly evolving data landscape, leveraging RMSE effectively can be the difference between a good model and a truly exceptional, robust predictive system.\n\nBy embracing these strategies and methodologies, you can ensure that your regression models are not only accurate today but also adaptive and resilient in the face of new data challenges.
