        "document": "Editor’s note: This article was last reviewed and updated by Ikeh Akinyemi in January 2025 to introduce advanced techniques for working with , such as handling multiple async operations concurrently using and managing async iterations with , as well as how to apply async/await within higher-order functions.\n\nAsynchronous programming is a way of writing code that can carry out tasks independently of each other, not needing one task to be completed before another gets started. When you think of asynchronous programming, think of multitasking and effective time management.\n\nIf you’re reading this, you probably have some familiarity with asynchronous programming in JavaScript, and you may be wondering how it works in TypeScript. That’s what we’ll explore in this guide.\n\nBefore diving into , it’s important to mention that promises form the foundation of asynchronous programming in JavaScript/TypeScript. A promise represents a value that might not be immediately available but will be resolved at some point in the future. A promise can be in one of the following three states:\n\nHere’s how to create and work with promises in TypeScript:\n\nPromises can be chained using for successful operations and for error handling:\n\nWe’ll revisit the concept of promises later, where we’ll discuss how to possibly execute asynchronous operations in parallel.\n\nTypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, so works the same, but with some extra goodies and type safety. TypeScript enables you to ensure type safety for the expected result and even check for type errors, which helps you detect bugs earlier in the development process.\n\nis essentially a syntactic sugar for promises, which is to say that the keyword is a wrapper over promises. An function always returns a promise. Even if you omit the keyword, the compiler will wrap your function in an immediately resolved promise.\n\nAlthough they look different, the code snippets above are more or less equivalent.\n\nsimply enables you to write the code more synchronously and unwraps the promise within the same line of code for you. This is powerful when you’re dealing with complex asynchronous patterns.\n\nTo get the most out of the syntax, you’ll need a basic understanding of promises.\n\nAs explained earlier, a promise refers to the expectation that something will happen at a particular time, enabling your app to use the result of that future event to perform certain other tasks.\n\nTo demonstrate what I mean, I’ll break down a real-world example and translate it into pseudocode, followed by the actual TypeScript code.\n\nLet’s say I have a lawn to mow. I contact a mowing company that promises to mow my lawn in a couple of hours. In turn, I promise to pay them immediately afterward, provided the lawn is properly mowed.\n\nCan you spot the pattern? The first obvious thing to note is that the second event relies entirely on the previous one. If the first event’s promise is fulfilled, the next event’s will be executed. The promise in that event is then either fulfilled, rejected, or remains pending.\n\nLet’s look at this sequence step by step and then explore its code:\n\nBefore we write out the full code, it makes sense to examine the syntax for a promise — specifically, an example of a promise that resolves into a string.\n\nWe declared a with the keyword, which takes in the and arguments. Now let’s write a promise for the flow chart above:\n\nIn the code above, we declared both the company’s promises and our promises. The company promise is either resolved after 100,000ms or rejected. A is always in one of three states: if there is no error, if an error is encountered, or if the has been neither rejected nor fulfilled. In our case, it falls within the period.\n\nBut how can we execute the task sequentially and synchronously? That’s where the keyword comes in. Without it, the functions simply run in the order they resolve.\n\nChaining promises allows them to run in sequence using the keyword. This functions like a normal human language — do this and then that and then that, and so on.\n\nThe code below will run the . If there is no error, it’ll run the . If there is an error in either of the two promises, it’ll be caught in the block:\n\nNow let’s look at a more technical example. A common task in frontend programming is to make network requests and respond to the results accordingly.\n\nBelow is a request to fetch a list of employees from a remote server:\n\nThere may be times when you need numerous promises to execute in parallel or sequence. Constructs such as or are especially helpful in these scenarios.\n\nFor example, imagine that you need to fetch a list of 1,000 GitHub users, and then make an additional request with the ID to fetch avatars for each of them. You don’t necessarily want to wait for each user in the sequence; you just need all the fetched avatars. We’ll examine this in more detail later when we discuss .\n\nNow that you have a fundamental grasp of promises, let’s look at the syntax.\n\nThe syntax simplifies working with promises in JavaScript. It provides an easy interface to read and write promises in a way that makes them appear synchronous.\n\nAn will always return a . Even if you omit the keyword, the compiler will wrap the function in an immediately resolved . This enables you to treat the return value of an function as a , which is useful when you need to resolve numerous asynchronous functions.\n\nAs the name implies, always goes hand in hand with . That is, you can only inside an function. The function informs the compiler that this is an asynchronous function.\n\nIf we convert the promises from above, the syntax looks like this:\n\nAs you can immediately see, this looks more readable and appears synchronous. We told the compiler to await the execution of before doing anything else. Then, we return the response from the .\n\nYou may have noticed that we omitted error handling. We could do this with the block after the in a promise. But what happens if we encounter an error? That leads us to .\n\nWe’ll refer to the employee fetching example to see the error handling in action, as it is likely to encounter an error over a network request.\n\nLet’s say, for example, that the server is down, or perhaps we sent a malformed request. We need to pause execution to prevent our program from crashing. The syntax will look like this:\n\nWe initiated the function as an function. We expect the return value to be either an array of employees or a string of error messages. Therefore, the type of promise is .\n\nInside the block are the expressions we expect the function to run if there are no errors. Meanwhile, the block captures any errors that arise. In that case, we’d just return the property of the object.\n\nThe beauty of this is that any error that first occurs within the block is thrown and caught in the block. An uncaught exception can lead to hard-to-debug code or even break the entire program.\n\nWhile traditional blocks are effective for catching errors at the local level, they can become repetitive and clutter the main business logic when used too frequently. This is where higher-order functions come into play.\n\nA higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function. In the context of error handling, a higher-order function can wrap an asynchronous function and handle any errors it might throw, thereby abstracting the logic away from the core business logic.\n\nThe main idea behind using higher-order functions for error handling in is to create a wrapper function that takes an async function as an argument along with any parameters that the async function might need. Inside this wrapper, we implement a block. This approach allows us to handle errors in a centralized manner, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.\n\nLet’s refer to the employee fetching example:\n\nIn this example, the function uses the higher-order function to wrap the original function.\n\nThis setup automatically handles any errors that might occur during the API call, logging them and returning to indicate an error state. The consumer of can then check if the returned value is to determine if the operation was successful or if an error occurred.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, there are times when we need promises to execute in parallel.\n\nLet’s look at an example from our employee API. Say we first need to fetch all employees, then fetch their names, and then generate an email from the names. Obviously, we’ll need to execute the functions in a synchronous manner and also in parallel so that one doesn’t block the other.\n\nIn this case, we would make use of . According to Mozilla, “ is typically used after having started multiple asynchronous tasks to run concurrently and having created promises for their results so that one can wait for all the tasks being finished.”\n\nIn pseudocode, we’d have something like this:\n• Wait for all user data. Extract the from each user. Fetch each user =>\n• Generate an email for each user from their username\n\nIn the above code, fetches all the employees from the . We the response, convert it to , and then return the converted data.\n\nThe most important concept to keep in mind is how we sequentially executed the code line by line inside the function with the keyword. We’d get an error if we tried to convert data to JSON that has not been fully awaited. The same concept applies to , except that we’d only fetch a single employee. The more interesting part is the , where we run all the async functions concurrently.\n\nFirst, wrap all the methods within inside a block. Next, the result of fetching all the employees. We need the of each employee to fetch their respective data, but what we ultimately need is information about the employees.\n\nThis is where we can call upon to handle all the concurrently. Each is executed concurrently for all the employees. The awaited data from the employees’ information is then used to generate an email for each employee with the function.\n\nIn the case of an error, it propagates as usual, from the failed promise to , and then becomes an exception we can catch inside the block.\n\nis great when we need all promises to succeed, but real-world applications often need to handle situations where some operations might fail while others succeed. Let’s consider our employee management system: What if we need to update multiple employee records, but some updates might fail due to validation errors or network issues?\n\nThis is where comes in handy. Unlike , which fails completely if any promise fails, will wait for all promises to complete, regardless of whether they succeed or fail. It gives us information about both successful and failed operations.\n\nThink of like a project manager tracking multiple tasks. Instead of stopping everything when one task fails (like would), the manager continues monitoring all tasks and provides a complete report of what succeeded and what failed. This is particularly useful when you need to:\n• Generate reports even if some data fetching fails\n\nSometimes we need to process large amounts of data that come in chunks or pages. Imagine you’re exporting employee data from a large enterprise system – there might be thousands of records that come in batches to prevent memory overload.\n\nThe loop is perfect for this scenario. It allows us to process asynchronous data streams one item at a time, making our code both efficient and readable. Here’s how we can use it with our employee system:\n\nThink of like a conveyor belt in a factory. Instead of waiting for all products (data) to be manufactured before starting to pack them (process them), we can pack each product as it comes off the belt. This approach has several benefits:\n• Memory efficient: We process one employee at a time instead of loading all data at once\n• Real-time processing: We can start working with data as soon as it’s available\n• Progress tracking: We can easily monitor and report progress as we process each item\n\nWhen working with our employee management system, we often need to process arrays of data asynchronously. Let’s see how we can effectively use array methods with :\n\nWhen working with these array methods, there are some important considerations:\n• with async operations returns an array of promises that need to be handled with\n• requires special handling because we can’t directly use the promise result as a filter condition\n• with async operations needs careful promise handling for the accumulator\n\nThere are use cases where utility functions are needed to carry out some operations on responses returned from asynchronous calls. We can create reusable higher-order functions that wrap async operations with these additional functionalities:\n\nIn this above snippet, the higher-order function adds caching capability to any async function that fetches data by ID. If the same ID is requested multiple times within five seconds (the default TTL), the function returns the cached result instead of making another API call. This significantly reduces unnecessary network requests when the same employee data is needed multiple times in quick succession.\n\nis a utility type that models operations like in functions. It unwraps the resolved value of a promise, discarding the promise itself, and works recursively, thereby removing any nested promise layers.\n\nis the type of value that you expect to get after awaiting a promise. It helps your code understand that once you use , you’re not dealing with a promise anymore, but with the actual data you wanted.\n\nThe type does not exactly model the method in promises, however can be relevant when using in functions. If you use inside a callback, helps infer the type of the awaited value, avoiding the need for additional type annotations.\n\ncan help clarify the type of and in functions, even when using for promise chaining. However, it doesn’t replace the functionality of itself.\n\nand enable us to write asynchronous code in a way that looks and behaves like synchronous code. This makes the code much easier to read, write, and understand.\n\nHere are some key concepts to keep in mind as you’re working on your next asynchronous project in TypeScript:\n• The function marked with the keyword always returns a\n• If the return value inside doesn’t return a , it will be wrapped in an immediately resolved\n• Execution is paused when an keyword is encountered until a is completed\n• will either return a result from a fulfilled or throw an exception from a rejected"

        "document": "Editor’s note: This guide to understanding Axios POST requests was last updated by Joseph Mawa on 1 July 2024 to cover working with Axios interceptors, including how to set up request and response interceptors, as well as to cover advanced POST request features, such as how to add a request body to an Axios POST request and handling POST request timeouts and cancellations.\n\nSending requests to a web server is one of the things most commonly performed in frontend development. Creating a Facebook post, uploading a new Instagram image, sending a post on X, or signing up on a website all send requests to a server.\n\nAxios is a free and open source promised-based HTTP library that runs both in the browser and Node.js. In this article, you’ll learn how to use the Axios method in vanilla JavaScript and frameworks like React. Before proceeding, you should have an understanding of React and how React form elements work.\n\nAxios is a lightweight HTTP client. You can use it to make asynchronous HTTP requests in the browser and Node.js. Because it’s promise-based, you can use promise chaining as well as JavaScript’s async/await.\n\nAxios is also quite similar to the native JavaScript Fetch API. It offers methods like , , , , , and more. In this article, we will focus on the method. To understand this method, let’s consider the following scenario.\n\nTake logging into Facebook. When we start using the app, it asks us to either sign up or log in if we already have an account. We must fill in the required form details and submit them to the server.\n\nThe server then verifies the information we submitted and loads the main app or responds with an error message if the provided credentials are incorrect. is the Axios method that allows us to do that. Below is what an Axios request looks like:\n\nFrom the code above, the Axios method takes three parameters: , , and . is the server path to which we are sending the request (note that it is a string). , which is an object, contains the request body that we’re sending to the server. Finally, is the third parameter where you can specify the header content type, authorization, and more. It is also in an object format.\n\nNow that we understand what Axios is and its method, let’s see how to use it.\n\nYou might wonder why you should use Axios instead of the native JavaScript Fetch API. Comparatively, Axios has some advantages over Fetch, which we will look at shortly.\n\nFirst, Axios serializes your request body into JSON string out of the box if the header is set to . This differs from the Fetch API, which requires you to first convert the payload to JSON string using , as shown below:\n\nSimilarly, Axios also de-serializes a JSON response out of the box. With the native Fetch API, you need to parse it using .\n\nUnlike the built-in Fetch API, Axios provides convenient methods for each of the HTTP request methods. To perform a request, you use the method, and so on:\n\nOther reasons to use Axios over the Fetch API include the following:\n• Better error handling by throwing a wide range of errors, including network errors\n• The ability to intercept HTTP requests and responses\n• Unlike Fetch, Axios can run in any browser or Node.js version\n• Axios has a built-in feature for protection against cross-site request forgery (XSRF)\n\nEarlier in this article, we explored how to use the Axios method in vanilla JavaScript and React. Let’s start with the former and then proceed to the latter. Keep in mind that this article will focus on React, and we will use the dummy API for our examples.\n\nHow to send an Axios request in vanilla JavaScript\n\nTo use Axios in vanilla JavaScript, we must first add the CDN link in the HTML before using it in the file. Let’s start by creating two files to use: and :\n\nThis HTML file has a simple login form with two input fields, the email and the password fields, and a submit button. At the bottom, just above the link, we also added the Axios CDN.\n\nNext, in the file we created above, we select the form element, and email and password elements using their s. We can then add a event handler to the form element. It is triggered whenever we submit the form:\n\nYou can submit and as the email and password values, respectively. The dummy API will return a response with a status code for a successful POST request:\n\nWe can now perform the same request in a React project. We need to first install Axios using npm or Yarn. Depending on your package manager, install Axios by running one of the commands below:\n\nWith Axios installed, let’s open our file. Unlike in vanilla JavaScript, we need to import Axios before using it. In our function, we will invoke the Axios method just as we did in the vanilla example above:\n\nThe above code illustrates how you can make an Axios POST request in React.\n\nLet’s look at another example where we create a new user or register as a new user. We will use the React Hook to manage state. Next, we set the value of our text inputs to our states ( and ) in our function.\n\nFinally, on , we make our Axios POST request with the data in our state. See the code below:\n\nYou can also create a file and copy the CSS styling below to style the app. It’s nothing fancy, but it improves the look of the UI:\n\nWith that, we have our registration app to use our method:\n\nUsing the async/await syntax with Axios\n\nIn the previous examples, we used promise chaining throughout. Similarly, you can also use the async/await syntax with Axios. When using and , we need to wrap our code in a block as in the example below:\n\nFrom the above example, we are awaiting a response from our request before we can perform an operation on the response. It works like the method we saw in the previous example.\n\nHow to handle POST request errors in Axios\n\nAs previously stated, one of the advantages of using Axios over the native Fetch API is that it allows us to handle response errors better.\n\nWith Axios, you can catch errors in the block and check for certain conditions to establish why the error occurred so that you can handle it appropriately. Let’s see how you can do that below:\n\nIn the condition, we check if there is a response, that is if our request was sent and the server responded with an HTTP status code outside the range. The HTTP status codes we can get here range from a status code telling us the user does not exist or that there are missing credentials, a error code telling us the page was not found, to a error code telling us the page is unavailable, etc.\n\nIn the condition, we checked to see if the request was made, but we received no response. This error is usually due to a network error or being offline.\n\nFinally, if the error received does not fall under the two categories above, then the block catches it and tells us what happened, which is most likely because an error occurred in the process of setting up the POST request. We can also use to make our error response more readable.\n\nThis section is slightly out of the scope of this tutorial, but it covers how to perform multiple requests concurrently using Axios with error handling.\n\nBecause Axios returns a promise, we can perform multiple requests using the static method. takes an iterable of promises as an argument and returns a single promise. It is fulfilled if all the input promises are fulfilled and is rejected immediately if one of the input promises is rejected:\n\nIn the example above, we have an array of user IDs. We mapped through the array and used Axios to initiate requests to our API. fulfills after all the promises have been fulfilled and rejects immediately if one of the promises is rejected.\n\nAdditionally, Axios has the built-in and helper functions for making concurrent requests. They have been deprecated though they may still work. Instead, you should use , as in the example above.\n\nOne of the benefits of using Axios over the built-in Fetch API is that Axios gives you the ability to intercept requests and responses. With Axios interceptors, you can modify requests and responses before handling them in your fulfillment and rejection handlers.\n\nYou can mount an Axios request interceptor to intercept and modify request config objects like so:\n\nYou should be aware that you can only add interceptors to a custom Axios instance, as in the example above.\n\nSimilarly, you can mount a response interceptor to modify response objects like so:\n\nThere are several use cases for Axios request interceptors. One of the main use cases is to authenticate users. Instead of manually adding authentication tokens, such as JWTs, to every request, you can add the token to the config object in the request interceptor.\n\nYou can also use request interceptors to transform request data. You can format the request object or include additional information, such as the request timestamp, to the payload before sending it to the server.\n\nRequest interceptors also come in handy for monitoring and logging purposes. You can log API endpoints, request methods, and any other request data that you can use later for debugging.\n\nThere are several use cases for intercepting responses in Axios. I will highlight some of them below.\n\nThe HTTP response you get from the server may have a payload with a different data type than the data type your application expects, especially when sourcing data from a third-party API. For example, the server response may be in XML format but your frontend code expects JSON. You can intercept the HTTP response and transform the payload into JSON.\n\nSimilarly, the server response may contain more data than your application needs. You can intercept the response and extract only the data your application needs.\n\nYou can also use response interceptors for error handling. You can get different kinds of errors from the server. Instead of having error handlers littered throughout your codebase, you can handle these errors centrally in a response interceptor. You can intercept the HTTP responses, log the errors for debugging, and handle them appropriately.\n\nSuch central error handling ensures your code is organized and maintainable. It will also ensure you provide appropriate client feedback regarding the success and failure of the POST request.\n\nHow to add a request body to an Axios POST request\n\nOrdinarily, when posting a simple object using Axios, you pass a plain JavaScript object to a POST request body, and by default, Axios will serialize your payload to a JSON string as in the code below.\n\nBy default, Axios will set the header to :\n\nYou can also submit an HTML form data as JSON. However, you need to set the header to like so:\n\nDepending on the data you want to transmit via a POST request, sometimes you may want Axios to encode your payload in a different format than JSON, such as when uploading text files, images, audio, videos, and other multimedia files.\n\nFor the latest versions, Axios can encode the request body to multi-part form data out of the box if you explicitly set the header to . It’s the encoding you use when uploading files:\n\nSimilarly, with the latest versions of Axios, you can set the header to if you want Axios to URL encode your payload out of the box:\n\nFor earlier versions of Axios, you will need to URL encode the payload using APIs such as or a third-party npm package before posting it.\n\nFor some reason, the server can sometimes delay responding to user requests or the network connection becomes unavailable. Therefore, you will have to timeout and cancel certain requests.\n\n In Axios, you can set the response to timeout using the property of the config object like so:\n\nIn the above example, Axios aborts the network connection if it fails to get a response from the server within 1.5 seconds. If the error is thrown because of a timeout, Axios will set the error code to .\n\nAlternatively, you can also timeout using the API. is now supported both in the browser and Node.js:\n\nInstead of a timeout, you can use the API to explicitly abort the request. This is useful in situations where a user navigates away from a given page after a network request has been initiated:\n\nAxios is a popular promised-based HTTP library that you can use both in the browser and Node.js. You can use it to make HTTP , , , , and requests both on the client and server side. In this article, our focus was on the method.\n\nUnlike the built-in Fetch API, Axios has several built-in features. With Axios, you can intercept and modify request and response objects. It also provides built-in features for automatic JSON serialization and de-serialization and superior error handling capabilities to the Fetch API.\n\nThough powerful and feature-rich, you should be aware that Axios is a third-party package. Like most third-party packages, Axios has its downsides. You need to consider the extra bundle size, security, licensing requirements, and long-term maintenance before using."

In this blog post, we will explore how to use Axios with React to make GET, POST, and DELETE API requests.\n\nAxios is a promise-based HTTP client for making requests to APIs in both browser and Node.js environments. It is designed to be lightweight, easy to use, and supports many advanced features such as interceptors, request and response transformations, and error handling. You can learn more about Axios from its official documentation.\n\nGetting Started with Axios and React\n\nTo start using Axios with React, you first need to install the Axios package. You can do this using npm or yarn:\n\nAfter installing Axios, you can import it into your React components and start using it to make API requests.\n\nMaking a GET Request with Axios and React\n\nLet's create a simple React component that fetches data from a public API using Axios and displays the results. We'll use the JSONPlaceholder API to fetch some sample data.\n\nIn this example, we've created a function that uses Axios to make a GET request to the JSONPlaceholder API. The fetched data is then stored in the state variable, which is initially set to an empty array. The function is called when the component mounts using the hook.\n\nNow let's create a form to add a new post and send it to the server using Axios. We'll create a new functional component called :\n\nIn this example, we've created a form with two inputs for the post's title and body. The form data is stored in the state variable, which is initially set to an object with empty strings for both fields. The function is used to update the state when the user types in the inputs.\n\nThe function is called when the form is submitted. This function uses Axios to make a POST request to the JSONPlaceholder API with the form data as the request body.\n\nFinally, let's add a button to delete a post using Axios. We'll modify the component to include a function:\n\nThe function takes an parameter and uses Axios to make a DELETE request to the JSONPlaceholder API. After the post is successfully deleted, we update the state by filtering out the deleted post based on its .\n\nIt's worth mentioning that Axios is not the only solution for making API requests in React. The native Fetch API is also a popular choice for making HTTP requests in modern web applications. While Axios offers some additional features like request and response interceptors, automatic JSON data transformation, and wider browser support, the Fetch API is built-in to modern browsers and may be sufficient for simple use cases.\n\nHowever, the choice between Axios and Fetch ultimately depends on your specific requirements, preferences, and familiarity with the libraries.\n\nQ: Can I use Axios with React class components?\n\n A: Yes, you can use Axios with React class components. You can call Axios inside the lifecycle method for fetching data when the component mounts or use the Axios inside event handlers for POST and DELETE requests.\n\nQ: Can I use Axios to make requests to different APIs in the same component?\n\n A: Yes, you can use Axios to make requests to multiple APIs within the same component. Just create separate functions for each API call and use them as needed.\n\nQ: Can I use Axios with other JavaScript frameworks or libraries?\n\n A: Yes, Axios is a standalone HTTP client library and can be used with any JavaScript framework or library, or even in plain JavaScript projects.\n\nQ: Can I use Axios to make requests to APIs that require authentication?\n\n A: Yes, you can use Axios to make requests to APIs that require authentication. You can set the required authentication headers (e.g., ) in the Axios request configuration.\n\nWe hope this blog post has provided you with a solid understanding of how to use Axios with React to make GET, POST, and DELETE API requests. With these skills, you can now build more complex and interactive React applications that interact with various APIs. Happy coding!"
