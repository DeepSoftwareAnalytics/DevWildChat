        "document": "You can write Playwright end-to-end testing code using JavaScript or TypeScript. Which one should you choose?\n\nWhen I started writing my first automated browser tests, I went with JavaScript because I couldn't be bothered with the type wrangling. I just wanted to get something off the ground quickly. YOLO, right?\n\nToday, though, there are two reasons why I last wrote a JavaScript-first Playwright test a very long time ago.\n\nFirst, if you're worried about massive type headaches, complicated TypeScript generics, and countless red squiggly lines in your editor when you \"just\" want to end-to-end test your product features, here's a secret: Playwright doesn't type-check your code. It understands and compiles TypeScript to JavaScript, but you can still write JavaScript or use types. Playwright will not judge you on your TypeScript skills and will run your tests.\n\nMore importantly, though, TypeScript is the better choice when planning to maintain a test suite in the long term because its benefits outweigh the added complexity. Auto-completion alone will make your test creation more manageable, and even though nobody likes to deal with type errors, when your test suite becomes a software project on its own, TypeScript warnings will help you discover problems in your code early.\n\nA few days ago, I found another TypeScript feature that allows me to structure complex end-to-end tests with test steps while writing less code. Doesn't this sound exciting?\n\nLet me show you how you can replace repetitive calls with a single decorator. Let's go!\n\nThe first problem: Playwright reports can be challenging to scan and understand.\n\nBy default, all your test actions and assertions will be a long wall of instructions shown in UI mode or your test reports. That's not a big deal for twenty instructions, but if you're testing a complex UI flow, your test instruction count will quickly hit a hundred actions. Looking at a report with that many instructions isn't great.\n\nTo solve this problem, you can group your actions in Playwright test steps.\n\nHere's a snippet right from the Playwright docs.\n\nYou define a step, give it a name and wrap your existing Playwright code in an async callback function. A complex test case becomes very readable with a few added test steps.\n\nLook at this beautiful and well-structured HTML test report. I'm a fan!\n\nYou might now ask, \"Does this work when you implement POMs (Page Object Model)?\".\n\nIt does, but wrapping every public class method in a test step isn't a great experience, which brings us to another problem.\n\nThe second problem: wrapping all methods in a test step is annoying.\n\nHere's an example POM to test the search on the official Playwright docs.\n\nWrapping one method in a test step ( in this case) isn't a big deal, but wrapping every public POM method will quickly feel like unnecessary busy work.\n\nIs there a better way to quickly add test steps?\n\nThe solution: automagically wrap your POM methods with TypeScript decorators.\n\nPlaywright doesn't include magic tricks to avoid this repetition, but we can use TypeScript tooling to make things easier. A TypeScript benefit I haven't mentioned yet is that TypeScript is a compiler that transforms your files into JavaScript.\n\nIn practice this means, that you can use modern JavaScript features in TypeScript and transform them to JavaScript code supported in older browsers or runtimes.\n\nOne of these modern JavaScript features is decorators. JavaScript Decorators aren't supported anywhere but work if you use TypeScript.\n\nJavaScript Decorators — a proposal that's been in the making forever.\n\nThe JavaScript decorator spec proposal saw the light of day eight years ago and reached ECMAScript proposal stage three. Proposals on stage three are considered \"ready to implement\".\n\nUnfortunately, no browser has bothered to implement the new language feature yet.\n\nHowever, this doesn't hinder the TypeScript team from shipping JavaScript decorators.\n\nBut what are they? If you look at the proposal, you'll find that:\n\nThis definition is somewhat cryptic. Let me explain the feature in my own words.\n\nWrapping class methods is what we need to avoid all these instructions. Let's find out how to define a decorator!\n\nHow to replace instructions with TypeScript decorators\n\nLet's look at our POM class again.\n\nIf you look at the method, we want to remove the from within the function body and somehow wrap the Playwright instructions with a test step. This situation is a perfect use case for decorators.\n\nFirst, we must apply a new decorator.\n\nTo decorate a class method with a Playwright step, put a line before the class method definition. Now TypeScript will complain…\n\n… because the decorator isn't defined yet.\n\nWhen TypeScript discovers the syntax, it will try to call a function. This function can be available in the current scope, or you can import it from somewhere in your codebase.\n\nWhen found, the decorator function will be called with a function reference to our original method ( ) and must return another function ( ). This returned function will replace the decorated method. Thanks to some low-level JavaScript, you can then call the original method ( ) with the passed-in arguments ( ).\n\nWhen you now run your tests and call a decorated class method, nothing has changed yet, but we're ready to apply some compilation magic. Let's extend the decorator!\n\nFirst, you can wrap your in a . Then, you only need to find a way to define a step name; ideally, it would relate to your original method.\n\nYou might have noticed it already; the decorator function will be called not only with the function reference but also with . The replacement methods will also run in the same this context as the original method. With these two things, we can combine the POM class name ( ) and the method name ( ) to define a relatable step name.\n\nIf we rerun our test, the decorator will do its magic and automatically wrap POM methods in a nice Playwright test step showing us the POM class and method. Beautiful!\n\nYou can now go wild and replace all these calls with decorators!\n\nBut what if you want to give your test steps a human-readable name?\n\nHow to pass custom step names to a decorator\n\nTo pass a custom step name to your decorator, you must change how you decorate the class methods. Instead of \"just applying\" a decorator with you can also execute your decorators with .\n\nThis change allows you to hand in arguments like a possible step name.\n\nBut you can't execute your decorator methods yet. Add another function level to your decorator to hand in arguments.\n\nRename your original decorator and wrap it in another function that will return it. Then, you can rely on function scope and reuse the step name argument ( ) to define a new step name in your replacement method. If isn't defined, the code above falls back to the class name / method name combination.\n\nYou can now name your test steps with a single line!\n\nUnfortunately, this approach has one downside. Once you make your step decorator function executable, you must execute it everywhere. must become .\n\nIn my opinion, adding is a very reasonable trade-off for the ability of setting custom step names, though.\n\nWhat do you think? Is implementing decorators for Playwright test steps worth the added complexity? For me, the answer is a firm \"Heck yeah!\".\n\nThe decorator code is quite complicated JavaScript / TypeScript, but you'll rarely touch this code. It's a typical \"set up once and forget about it\" case, and I bet you'll fall in love with the easy-to-use decoratorar one-liners quickly.\n\nIf you want to see this decorator implementation, find a complete example implementation next to more Playwright example code on GitHub, and if you have any questions or comments, drop into the Checkly community.

These design choices allow Playwright users to forget about flaky timeouts and racy checks in their tests altogether.\n• How to write the first test\n• How to use assertions\n• How to use test hooks\n\nTake a look at the following example to see how to write a test.\n\nMost of the tests will start with navigating page to the URL. After that, test will be able to interact with the page elements.\n\nPlaywright will wait for page to reach the load state prior to moving forward. Learn more about the page.goto() options.\n\nPerforming actions starts with locating the elements. Playwright uses Locators API for that. Locators represent a way to find element(s) on the page at any moment, learn more about the different types of locators available. Playwright will wait for the element to be actionable prior to performing the action, so there is no need to wait for it to become available.\n\nIn most cases, it'll be written in one line:\n\nThis is the list of the most popular Playwright actions. Note that there are many more, so make sure to check the Locator API section to learn more about them.\n\nPlaywright includes test assertions in the form of function. To make an assertion, call and choose a matcher that reflects the expectation.\n\nThere are many generic matchers like , , that can be used to assert any conditions.\n\nPlaywright also includes async matchers that will wait until the expected condition is met. Using these matchers allows making the tests non-flaky and resilient. For example, this code will wait until the page gets the title containing \"Playwright\":\n\nHere is the list of the most popular async assertions. Note that there are many more to get familiar with:\n\nPlaywright Test is based on the concept of test fixtures such as the built in page fixture, which is passed into your test. Pages are isolated between tests due to the Browser Context, which is equivalent to a brand new browser profile, where every test gets a fresh environment, even when multiple tests run in a single Browser.\n\nYou can use various test hooks such as to declare a group of tests and and which are executed before/after each test. Other hooks include the and which are executed once per worker before/after all tests.\n• See a trace of your tests"

It is​​ developed and​​ supported by Microsoft​​ and is one of the best tools for UI and API testing.​​ The playwright​​ does not require any complicated configuration. Everything like –​​ Typescript, ​​ assertion library, Test runner​​, etc. are packed​​ by default​​ inside Playwright.\n• People who use Playwright can handle web browsers such as Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari just like they do with their mobile phones when taking pictures, recording videos, or engaging with others on social media.\n• The official documentation for Playwright can be found at https://playwright.dev/\n• TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. Playwright is a tool for automating browser actions, such as clicking buttons, filling forms, and navigating between pages. TypeScript provides type checking and other advanced features that can improve the development experience when working with Playwright.\n• Combining Playwright with TypeScript offers a powerful solution for web application testing. Playwright enables automated browser testing, allowing you to simulate user interactions across various browsers. TypeScript adds static typing and advanced features to JavaScript, enhancing code quality and maintainability.\n\n1. Automated Browser Testing: Playwright simplifies end-to-end testing by offering a high-level API to interact with web browsers.\n\n3. Test Frameworks: Popular frameworks like Jest, Mocha, or Jasmine can be used with Playwright and TypeScript to define test cases and assert expected outcomes.\n\n4. Page Object Model (POM): Implementing POM allows encapsulating web pages as objects, making tests modular and easier to maintain.\n\n5. Continuous Integration (CI): Integrate Playwright tests into CI pipelines for automated testing upon code changes, ensuring early detection of regressions.\n\n6. Reporting and Analysis: Playwright supports generating detailed test reports for analysis, aiding in identifying and diagnosing issues.\n\n7. Auto-Wait: Playwright automatically waits for elements to be actionable before performing actions, eliminating the need for artificial timeouts and reducing test flakiness.\n\n8. Browser Contexts: Playwright creates a browser context for each test, equivalent to a brand-new browser profile, delivering full test isolation with zero overhead. Creating a new browser context is fast, taking only a few milliseconds.\n\n9. Tracing and Debugging: Playwright provides built-in tracing capabilities to capture execution traces, videos, and screenshots during test runs, aiding in identifying and debugging issues and eliminating flaky tests.\n\n10. Support for Shadow DOM and Frames: Playwright’s selectors can pierce through Shadow DOM and seamlessly enter frames, allowing interaction with elements within these contexts during testing.\n\n11. Cross-Language Support: Playwright supports multiple programming languages, including TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, and .NET (C#), enabling teams with diverse language preferences to collaborate and contribute to testing efforts using their preferred language.\n\nThe recommended IDE for working with Playwright is Visual Studio Code (VS Code). VS. Code is a popular and the lightweight code editor that provides excellent support for TypeScript, JavaScript, and debugging capabilities. It offers a seamless development experience for Playwright, allowing you to write, debug, and test your Playwright scripts efficiently.\n\nHowever, it’s worth noting that Playwright is a versatile framework, and you can use other IDEs as well, depending on your preferences. Some developers also use JetBrains IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA or WebStorm for Playwright development. These IDEs offer features like code completion, debugging, and integrated terminal support.\n\nIn this blog, during the practical demonstration, we utilized the following versions for the respective libraries and applications:\n• To download the VS code, visit its official website and choose the .exe file for the community version.\n• After the download finishes, launch the .exe file and proceed with installing VS Code.\n• You can refer to the instructions provided on this website for guidance on Installing VS code.\n• Downloading the Node.js ‘. MSI’ installer the first step to installing Node.js on Windows is to download the installer. Visit the official Node.js website i.e) https://nodejs.org/en/download/\n• Select “Next” up to the Finish button.\n• Verify that Node.js was properly installed or not using the “C:\\Users\\Admin> node -v” command. If node.js was completely installed on your system, the command prompt will print the version of the Node JS installed.\n\nThere are 2 ways to install a playwright.\n• Open Your Code Editor: Launch your preferred code editor. For example, if you’re using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), open it on your system.\n• New Project: Create a new project and open it into the vs code.\n• Navigate to Extensions Marketplace: Look for the extensions marketplace within your code editor. In VS Code, you can find it on the left sidebar or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+X.\n• Search for Playwright Extension: In the extensions marketplace, search for the Playwright extension. You can find it by typing “Playwright” into the search bar.\n• Install the Extension: Once you’ve found the Playwright extension, click on the “Install” button next to it. Wait for the installation process to complete.\n• Install the Playwright: Press Ctrl + shift + P and search the `Playwright` keyword in the search box. Click on the `Install playwright` button and also install the necessary browser.\n• For writing the first script, we first need to create a javascript or typescript file.\n• In this typescript, the file extension must be a .ts\n• We can add the below code to the file.\n• Let’s understand the example outlined above.\n• Imports:\n• The code starts by importing `test` and `expect` from @playwright/test. These are used for writing tests and assertions, respectively.\n• It also imports `chromium` from `playwright` which is a browser engine that Playwright can control.\n• Test Description:\n• `test.describe()` function defines a test suite named “Navigation Test”. A test suite is a collection of test cases that test a specific feature or functionality.\n• Test Function:\n• Inside the test suite, there’s a test function defined using test() function. This test function verifies that the user can successfully navigate to the “Life At Jignect” page.\n• The test function is defined using an async function because it contains asynchronous operations (e.g., launching browser, navigating to URL, interacting with elements).\n• Page Setup:\n• Inside the test function, a Chromium browser instance is launched using `chromium.launch()`.\n• A new browser context is created using `browser.newContext()`.\n• A new page is opened in the browser context using `context.newPage()`.\n• Assertion:\n• Finally, an assertion is made using `expect()` function to verify that the `titleText` retrieved from the heading element is equal to ‘Life At Jignect’.\n\nRun the created Test Case and check the Result\n\n1. Once you’ve written the test script, run the test and check the results carefully.\n\nThere are two ways to run the test script.\n• Open the terminal and hit the command: npx playwright test {testname}.\n• Another way is by clicking on the green triangle from the code.\n\nIn summary, the integration of Playwright with TypeScript offers a robust and efficient solution for web application testing. Playwright simplifies browser automation with its high-level API and comprehensive features, while TypeScript enhances code quality and maintainability with static typing and advanced language features. Together, they empower development teams to accelerate testing processes, improve test coverage, and deliver superior-quality software products in a streamlined and efficient manner.

TypeScript was first developed by Microsoft and then released publicly in 2012 as an open-source project. The goal of the language was to make it easier to develop large, complex applications in JavaScript. TypeScript supports classes and static typing, among other programming language constructs not found in older JavaScript language standards, leading to better structured code and improved support in development tools such as IDEs.\n\nHow to Generate a UUID in TypeScript\n\nAlthough neither the TypeScript nor JavaScript language have built-in support for generating a UUID or GUID, there are plenty of quality 3rd party, open-source libraries that you can use.\n\nThe JavaScript library we recommend for generating UUIDs in TypeScript is called (unsurprisingly), .

By leveraging i18next's type-safe features, developers can ensure that their translations are properly typed and validated during development. Here are some key steps to take advantage of i18next's type safety:\n\nOne of the key advantages of using TypeScript for i18n is its strong typing system. TypeScript's type-safe features enable developers to catch potential errors during compilation, reducing runtime issues and improving code reliability. Additionally, TypeScript's integration with popular i18n libraries, such as i18next, provides a seamless and efficient development experience.\n\nInternationalization is the process of designing and developing software that can adapt to various languages and regions without requiring significant engineering changes. By implementing i18n best practices, developers can create applications that cater to a diverse user base, improve user experience, and streamline localization efforts.\n\nIn recent years, TypeScript has gained significant popularity among developers. With Typescript you can easily enhance code quality, maintainability, and scalability. Learn more about Typescript's benefits here . As businesses expand their reach globally, implementing effective internationalization (i18n) strategies in TypeScript applications has become crucial. In this article, we will explore the best practices, libraries, and tutorials for mastering TypeScript i18n in 2025.\n\nYour terms, your stack. Experience unmatched speed and flexibility with Caisy - the Headless CMS you've been dreaming of.\n\nOne of the challenges in internationalization is handling interpolation and grammar rules across different languages. Interpolation involves inserting dynamic values into translated strings, which can lead to issues when dealing with language-specific grammar rules. To overcome this challenge, consider the following best practices:\n• None Avoid interpolation when translation values are known and available.\n• None Use fully self-contained strings for each possible value to handle grammar rules correctly.\n• None Utilize separate keys instead of placeholders for specific values (e.g., \"credit card\" or \"PayPal account\").\n\nWhen it comes to managing content for internationalized applications, using a headless CMS like Caisy can greatly simplify the process. A headless CMS decouples the content from the presentation layer, allowing developers to manage translations and localized content separately from the application code. This approach enables more flexibility, easier collaboration with translation teams, and faster updates to the application's content. Learn more about what a Headless CMS is.\n\nProviding clear context and considering cultural nuances are essential for effective internationalization. Here are some strategies to achieve this:\n• None Always write full sentences and use interpolation to insert variables for clear context.\n• None Use meta locales (\"id\" and \"pseudo\") during development to identify keys and test layouts.\n• None Consider cultural and regional differences in translations (e.g., \"fresh water\" vs. \"tap water\").\n• None Collaborate with native speakers or professional translators to ensure accurate and culturally appropriate translations.\n\nBy implementing all of these strategies, developers can create translations that are not only linguistically correct but also culturally relevant and meaningful to the target audience.\n\nTo ensure a smooth and effective TypeScript i18n implementation, it's important to be aware of common pitfalls and how to avoid them. Some key considerations include:\n• None Avoid sentence bit concatenation, as it can lead to incorrect translations due to syntax and grammar differences across languages.\n• None Use pseudo-localization and faux content to detect layout and encoding issues early in the development process.\n• None Adapt number and percent formats to different languages and regions.\n• None Be cautious of automated translation tools, as they may not ensure accurate and fluent translations.\n• None Start localization from the project's beginning and continuously collaborate with translators throughout the development lifecycle.\n\nIn this section, we'll dive deep into the integration of popular i18n libraries with TypeScript, focusing on their compatibility, usage, and advanced techniques. We'll explore libraries such as i18next, typesafe-i18n, and custom solutions tailored to specific application needs.\n\nExploring Compatibility and Usage of i18next, typesafe-i18n, and Custom Libraries\n\nWhen it comes to integrating i18n libraries with TypeScript, developers have several options to choose from. One of the most popular choices is i18next, which offers embedded TypeScript definitions, albeit with some limitations. However, these definitions can be improved through type augmentation and interface merging techniques.\n\nAnother promising library is typesafe-i18n, which boasts full type safety, lightweight implementation, and support for plural rules, date, and number formatting. It seamlessly integrates with various frameworks like Angular, React, Vue.js, Svelte, Solid.js, and Node.js, making it a versatile choice for frontend, backend, and API projects.\n\nFor developers seeking more control and customization, building a custom i18n library with TypeScript is an attractive option. By addressing the limitations of third-party libraries, custom solutions can be tailored to specific application requirements. A notable example is the Gaia library, which provides basic i18n functionalities such as locale detection, loading translations, and displaying translated content.\n\nTo get started with i18next in a TypeScript application, follow these steps:\n• None Set up your TypeScript application and install the necessary dependencies.\n• None Configure i18next by creating an instance and setting the required options.\n• None Create JSON resource files for each supported language, containing the translation keys and their corresponding values.\n• None Use the function provided by i18next to access and display the translated content in your application.\n\nHere's an example of how to use i18next in a TypeScript application:\n\nTo handle dynamic content and enhance the localization capabilities of your TypeScript application, consider the following advanced techniques:\n• None Plurals: Manage singular and plural forms of translations based on the count of items. Libraries like i18next and typesafe-i18n provide support for defining plural rules in the translation files.\n• None Fallback Namespaces: Utilize fallback namespaces to handle missing translations gracefully. By specifying fallback namespaces, you can ensure that a default translation is displayed when a specific translation is not available.\n• None Interpolation: Incorporate dynamic values into your translations using interpolation techniques. This allows you to include variables, dates, numbers, and other dynamic content within the translated strings.\n\nHere's an example of handling plurals and interpolation using i18next:\n\nSeamless Integration of TypeScript i18n with React and Other Frameworks\n\nIntegrating TypeScript i18n with popular frameworks like React, Angular, Vue.js, and others is a breeze thanks to the extensive ecosystem and community support. Libraries like i18next and typesafe-i18n provide dedicated packages and plugins that simplify the integration process.\n\nFor example, when using i18next with React, you can leverage the package, which offers higher-order components and hooks to access translations and manage the language state within your components.\n\nSimilar integration patterns and best practices are available for other frameworks, ensuring a seamless experience when working with TypeScript i18n in your preferred development environment.\n\nWhen working with internationalization (i18n) in TypeScript applications, handling dynamic content and translations can be challenging. In this section, we'll explore various approaches and techniques for managing dynamic content effectively, ensuring type safety, and building robust multilingual applications.\n\nOne of the key aspects of handling dynamic content in TypeScript i18n is maintaining type safety during translation interpolation. i18next, a popular i18n library, provides embedded TypeScript definitions. However, these definitions have limitations when it comes to ensuring type safety for interpolated values.\n\nTo overcome this challenge, we can leverage TypeScript's type augmentation and interface merging capabilities. By extending the i18next definitions and merging interfaces, we can enhance the development experience and catch potential errors at compile-time.\n\nHere are a couple of approaches for achieving type safety in interpolation:\n• None const translation = i18next.t('key', { value: 'example' } as const);\n\nBy adopting these techniques, we can ensure that the interpolated values match the expected types, leading to more robust and maintainable code.\n\nAngular, a popular TypeScript framework, provides built-in support for i18n. When it comes to handling dynamic content in Angular i18n, there are several approaches available:\n• None NgSwitch in Template: Use the directive in the template to conditionally display different translation items based on specific values. For example:\n• None Select Expression in i18n Attribute: Utilize the select expression within the attribute to handle different cases based on a variable's value. For example:\n• None Translation File with Translation Pipe: Store the translated values in a JSON file (e.g., ) and use the translation pipe in the template to display the appropriate translation based on a variable's value. For example:\n\nThese approaches provide flexibility in handling dynamic translations within Angular templates, allowing for seamless localization of dynamic content.\n\nWhile using existing i18n libraries like i18next is common, building a custom JavaScript i18n library with TypeScript can be a valuable learning experience. Let's take a look at an example library called Gaia.\n\nGaia is a custom i18n library that provides basic functionality such as locale detection, defining supported locales, loading translations, setting the locale, and displaying translations. It also supports advanced features like interpolation, handling singular/plural forms, and formatting dates and currency.\n\nHere's an example of how Gaia handles interpolation with dynamic arguments:\n\nGaia also supports defining plural forms in the translation files:\n\nBuilding a custom i18n library provides a deeper understanding of the inner workings of third-party i18n libraries and allows for customization tailored to specific project requirements.\n\nTo illustrate the practical application of dynamic content localization, let's consider three real-world examples:\n• None\n• None Shipping options and estimated delivery dates based on the user's location.\n• None Personalized product recommendations using the user's browsing history and language preferences.\n• None\n• None Localized search results based on the user's language and location.\n• None Customized travel itineraries generated based on the user's preferences and cultural background.\n• None\n• None Real-time translation of user-generated content, such as posts and comments.\n• None Localized trending topics and hashtags based on the user's language and region.\n• None Personalized news feed and advertisements tailored to the user's interests and cultural context.\n\nThese examples showcase the importance of handling dynamic content effectively.\n\nWhen it comes to implementing internationalization (i18n) in TypeScript projects, developers have a wide array of libraries to choose from. In this section, we'll compare popular JavaScript internationalization libraries, evaluate custom i18n solutions built with TypeScript, conduct an in-depth analysis of typesafe-i18n features and benefits, and explore i18next as a mature and extensible library for TypeScript i18n.\n\nJavaScript offers several general-purpose internationalization libraries, such as i18next, FormatJS, Globalize, and Polyglot. Framework-specific libraries like Vue I18n and @angular/localize cater to specific frameworks, while older libraries like jQuery.i18n still find use in legacy projects. When evaluating these libraries, consider factors such as framework integration, documentation quality, update frequency, download metrics, and bundle size to ensure compatibility and performance in your TypeScript project.\n\ntypesafe-i18n is a lightweight, type-safe, and efficient internationalization library designed specifically for TypeScript projects. It offers a range of features, including plural rules, value formatting for dates and numbers, and gender-specific output via switch-case statements. The library supports asynchronous locale loading and is suitable for various use cases, including frontend, backend, and API projects across frameworks like Angular, React, Vue.js, and more.\n\nOne of the key advantages of typesafe-i18n is its type safety, which helps prevent errors and provides autocompletion and error detection during development. The library generates TypeScript definitions automatically, ensuring a seamless integration with your codebase. Additionally, typesafe-i18n is lightweight and optimized for reduced network traffic and workload, making it an efficient choice for performance-critical applications.\n\ni18next, established in 2011, is a mature and widely-used internationalization library that has proven its sustainability and versatility over the years. With its modular architecture, i18next is compatible with any JavaScript environment and UI framework, making it a flexible choice for TypeScript projects.\n\nThe library offers a rich set of features, including multi-file translations, language detection, and dynamic fallback, ensuring a smooth localization process. While i18next has an extensive set of functionalities, developers can reduce the bundle size through precompilation techniques. The library also excels in server-side optimization, efficiently handling asynchronous requests.\n\nOne notable aspect of i18next is its compatibility with locize.com, a localization workflow platform. This integration simplifies the management and synchronization of translations across projects, making it an attractive choice for teams working on large-scale applications.\n\nIn conclusion, when selecting an internationalization library for your TypeScript project, consider factors such as framework compatibility, performance, type safety, and ease of use. Custom solutions built with TypeScript offer flexibility and optimization, while established libraries like typesafe-i18n and i18next provide a balance of features, maturity, and community support.

        "document": "In today’s globalized digital world, our applications often need to support multiple languages and regions. Localization means making our app fit different languages and cultures for a good user experience.\n\nHowever, handling localization can be tricky. It’s easy to mix up variables or use the wrong translation key, and these mistakes often lead to runtime errors or incorrect translations.\n\nTypeScript, with its strong type system, provides an excellent foundation for achieving safer and more efficient localization. In this blog post, we’ll explore how to harness TypeScript’s type system to make localization safer and more robust. You can find the example source code for this post in my GitHub repo.\n\nBefore we delve into localization, let’s learn about a closely related concept: Internationalization (i18n).\n\nInternationalization is the process of designing and developing applications in a way that makes them adaptable to various languages and cultures. The term “i18n” is a shorthand notation for “internationalization.” It means “i” followed by 18 letters and then “n.” Similarly, “localization” is often abbreviated as “l10n.”\n\nLocalization (l10n) is the process of customizing an application for a particular region or language, which includes translating text, formatting dates and currencies, and making cultural adjustments, such as switching the writing direction.\n\nThink of internationalization as the setup phase that makes our app ready to be adapted to suit different locales. Localization is where we customize our applications to meet the unique needs and preferences of a particular region or language.\n\nNow we understand the basics of i18n and l10n, let’s have a look at how to implement them using i18next.\n\ni18next is a popular open source i18n library for JavaScript that makes it easy to add multilingual support to our applications. It’s designed to help developers manage translations, handle pluralization, and manage the localization of content effectively.\n\ni18next has embedded TypeScript definitions. With type definitions, the TypeScript compiler can detect errors like typos in the translation keys at compile time and reduce the chance of runtime errors. However, there are some limitations to the out-of-the-box features.\n\nWe use a contrived example below to demonstrate how to leverage and improve i18next’s existing features to achieve type safety in a TypeScript application.\n\nWe start by creating a TypeScript application from scratch:\n\nNext, in the file, configure the and set to so that TypeScript compiles our code to JavaScript in the folder:\n\nAdd the following script commands to the :\n\nWe can now run the application using the following command:\n\nLet’s implement localization with i18next in our new TypeScript app. Install i18next and its necessary dependencies:\n\nNext, create JSON files for the supported languages. For example, create for English and for Spanish. These files should contain translation key-value pairs:\n\nAfter we create the JSON resource files, we add a new file, , which configures localization with the i18next library, as below:\n\nLet’s break down the code above:\n• : This block initializes the i18next library with various configuration options\n• and : These options specify the default and fallback languages. In this example, both are set to , indicating that both are English\n• : This option is set to , which enables debug mode. In debug mode, i18next provides additional information for development purposes\n• : This object defines the available language resources and maps language codes ( for English and for Spanish) to their respective translation files\n\nIn summary, the above code sets up i18next with default settings for two languages, English and Spanish, using JSON files for translation resources. The namespace is defined as the default namespace. The i18next instance is configured and available for use in other parts of the application:\n\nTo use i18next as we configured it, we can update the file as follows:\n\nIn the above code, we changed the language setting to English (‘en’) using the i18next library. Then, we used i18next to translate a message with the function, which looks up translations using the message key and any optional parameters you set to address dynamic data interpolation.\n\nWe should see the following console output:\n\nWe can switch the language to Spanish by modifying the line to the following:\n\nThe console output will be similar to the one below:\n\nThis means our i18next localization works for our app! However, it isn’t type-safe. For example, if I made a mistake by entering an incorrect translation key, as below:\n\nWe won’t get any errors or warnings at compile time. When I run the app, I’ll get the following runtime error:\n\nTo solve this issue, we can implement a TypeScript definition for our app.\n\nWe can expand TypeScript definitions for i18next through type augmentation and interface merging. To start, create a declaration file named under the folder:\n\nThe above type definition file extends the module to include an additional interface.\n\nWe also need to make sure the section in the file has either the flag or that is set to :\n\nWith the extension of our type definitions, the TypeScript compiler type checking works now.\n\nIf I enter an incorrect translation key, the compiler will throw the following error:\n\nIf we try to compile and run the application, it will throw the same error:\n\n\n\nDespite the improvements we made above, type checking has a limitation: there isn’t a way to type check the automatic interpolation inference.\n\nFor instance, if I enter an incorrect string interpolation key, such as instead of , there won’t be any compile time errors:\n\nIf I run the application, the output will look like the below:\n\nThere are two approaches we can choose between to improve the interpolation’s type safety:\n\nIn TypeScript, we use to create a literal type that’s as narrow as possible.\n\nWe can use to convert the JSON resource file to a TypeScript file and extract the type out of the newly created TypeScript constant. We can simply rename the resource file, i.e., from to , and change the first line to and the last line to .\n\nHere is the result:\n\nThen, we update our type definition file as follows:\n\nThe extracted type is like the below:\n\nWe also need to update the file to update the reference to the new file instead of the file.\n\nNow, if we enter a wrong key in the interpolation, the TypeScript compiler will throw an error:\n\n\n\nThe benefit of this approach is that the type is directly extracted from the file, and thus we don’t need to maintain another, separate TypeScript file. If there is a change in the file (i.e., we added a new translation key-value pair), the change will be automatically reflected in the extracted type.\n\nAnother way to achieve the additional type safety is to generate an interface file using the . This library is designed to transform resources to be used in a typesafe i18next project.\n\nTo start, install it using the following command:\n\nThen, we can generate an interface file from the JSON resource files using the following command. Note that the command is run from the project’s root directory:\n\nWe generate a file as below. It contains a TypeScript interface based on the resource JSON file:\n\nThen, we update the type definition file to reference the new interface:\n\nThat’s it! We achieve the same level of type safety as the first approach. If we have a typo for the string interpolation key, the TypeScript compiler will immediately throw an error, and the compile will fail.\n\nHowever, this approach will require us to maintain both a resource file and an interface file. Thus, we need to re-generate the interface file for every resource file change. Therefore, the approach is a better option from a maintenance perspective.\n\nIn this article, we create a contrived TypeScript example with a setup of i18next with default settings for two languages, English and Spanish, and used JSON files for translation data. We also implement the type definition file to add compile-time type checking and further improve type safety by converting the JSON file to TypeScript constants or using a generated interface.\n\ni18next and TypeScript complement each other well. TypeScript’s strong typing and type definitions enhance the development experience, making it easier to manage translations and ensure type safety, ultimately resulting in more robust and maintainable multilingual applications.\n\nYou can find the example source code from the GitHub repo."

It involves providing language options and automatically translating the application content based on the user’s choice or the default language setting configured within the app.\n\nIn this article i want to share how we can implement localization in express typescript project let’s go\n\nfirst you can clone my project on my github page at link below\n\nand after clone is done you can move to the path project and open terminal from inside it, then you can just run npm install to install the depedency for this project after install successfull we ready to develop the feature 👌\n\nFirst you can install the library for create localization, open terminal or command prompt and run this command\n\nafter that you can install this library so typescript can recognize the library\n\nenough for library installation, next in ./utils folder you can create file with name language.ts and write code like this\n\nimport and use the language.ts in app.ts like this\n\nso in app.ts code is look like this\n\nstill in ./utils folder you can create file with name redis.ts for setup the redis connection and write code like this\n\nnext you can create page language with dropdown to change the language dynamicly, first let’s create the controller file in ./controllers/backoffice and write code like this\n\nin this controller we use redis to get the language data and use flash message to notify if user success changed the language, next you can create routes to handle language request, here’s the code\n\nand don’t forget to import the routes language in app.ts\n\nnext move to ./views folder and create language folder with index.ejs inside, write code like this\n\nand here’s the UI of language page\n\nand now let’s create the trigger if use submit the change language, first we create ajax function in ./views/language/index.ejs to handle user request language\n\nwe get the value of dropdown selected and send it to endpoint /backoffice/language with ajax post, so the final code in index.ejs is look like this\n\ncreate controller to handle store language data, in ./controllers/backoffice/language/index.ts create function store like this\n\nwe get the body request where the inside is language data and store it in redis use redisClient.set(‘language’, data), and create flash message before redirect back to language page here’s the final code in language.ts\n\nand don’t forget to import store function in language routes like this\n\nand here’s the main course 😆, to use language globaly create middleware function in app.ts where it load the setup language, here’s the code\n\nwe set default language to en it stand for english if the language data not set in redis and set the language data in cookie, and we write res.locals.translate = req.t it so we can use translate() as a global function for example\n\nwhere the string inside translate function will auto translate depend on language setting. Here’s the final code in app.ts is look like this\n\nCreate folder in ./src with name locales and inside locales create folder with name of language for example en folder is to English, id folder is to Bahasa Indonesia and so on\n\ninside of each folder language create file with name translation.json and write data json like this\n\nthe translate function will read this file json depend on language setting\n\nafter all if we try to change language it will auto translate like this\n\nOk, That’s how we use localization in Express Typescript. Thanks! 🙌"

        "document": "I’ve always felt that implementing localization and translations in React/React Native apps is unnecessarily painful. Defining all strings in a single JSON file feels messy, and most solutions are full of boilerplate, expensive, or lack developer-friendly workflows.\n\nI’m building a new open-source translation and localization API specifically for React and React Native apps, and I’d love your feedback to make this better.\n• What’s your biggest frustration when adding localization to your app?\n• What would you want improved in the DX (Developer Experience)?\n• Are there any features you wish current tools had but don’t?\n\nI want to solve real pain points and would love to hear about your experiences. Let’s make localization suck less!"
