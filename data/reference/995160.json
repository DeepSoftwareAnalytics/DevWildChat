        "document": "The crate provides a single logging API that abstracts over the actual logging implementation. Libraries can use the logging API provided by this crate, and the consumer of those libraries can choose the logging implementation that is most suitable for its use case.\n\nIf no logging implementation is selected, the facade falls back to a “noop” implementation that ignores all log messages. The overhead in this case is very small - just an integer load, comparison and jump.\n\nA log request consists of a target, a level, and a body. A target is a string which defaults to the module path of the location of the log request, though that default may be overridden. Logger implementations typically use the target to filter requests based on some user configuration.\n\nThe basic use of the log crate is through the five logging macros: , , , and where represents the highest-priority log messages and the lowest. The log messages are filtered by configuring the log level to exclude messages with a lower priority. Each of these macros accept format strings similarly to .\n\nAvoid writing expressions with side-effects in log statements. They may not be evaluated.\n\nLibraries should link only to the crate, and use the provided macros to log whatever information will be useful to downstream consumers.\n\nExecutables should choose a logging implementation and initialize it early in the runtime of the program. Logging implementations will typically include a function to do this. Any log messages generated before the implementation is initialized will be ignored.\n\nThe executable itself may use the crate to log as well.\n\nThe logging system may only be initialized once.\n\nIf you enable the feature you can associate structured values with your log records. If we take the example from before, we can include some additional context besides what’s in the formatted message:\n\nSee the module documentation for more details.\n\nIn order to produce log output executables have to use a logger implementation compatible with the facade. There are many available implementations to choose from, here are some of the most popular ones:\n• For dynamic libraries:\n• You may need to construct an FFI-safe wrapper over to initialize in your libraries\n\nLoggers implement the trait. Here’s a very basic example that simply logs all messages at the , or levels to stdout:\n\nLoggers are installed by calling the function. The maximum log level also needs to be adjusted via the function. The logging facade uses this as an optimization to improve performance of log messages at levels that are disabled. It’s important to set it, as it defaults to , so no log messages will ever be captured! In the case of our example logger, we’ll want to set the maximum log level to , since we ignore any or level log messages. A logging implementation should provide a function that wraps a call to and , handling initialization of the logger:\n\nImplementations that adjust their configurations at runtime should take care to adjust the maximum log level as well.\n\nrequires you to provide a , which can be hard to obtain if your logger depends on some runtime configuration. The function is available with the Cargo feature. It is identical to except that it takes a rather than a :\n\nLog levels can be statically disabled at compile time by enabling one of these Cargo features:\n\nLog invocations at disabled levels will be skipped and will not even be present in the resulting binary. These features control the value of the constant. The logging macros check this value before logging a message. By default, no levels are disabled.\n\nIt is possible to override this level for release builds only with the following features:\n\nLibraries should avoid using the max level features because they’re global and can’t be changed once they’re set.\n\nFor example, a crate can disable trace level logs in debug builds and trace, debug, and info level logs in release builds with the following configuration:\n\nThe following crate feature flags are available in addition to the filters. They are configured in your .\n• allows use of crate instead of the default . Enables using and functionality.\n• enables support for serialization and deserialization of and .\n\nThe 0.3 and 0.4 versions of the crate are almost entirely compatible. Log messages made using 0.3 will forward transparently to a logger implementation using 0.4. Log messages made using 0.4 will forward to a logger implementation using 0.3, but the module path and file name information associated with the message will unfortunately be lost."

        "document": "Unfortunately, in your case you cannot create a from other error types, if the library does not provide a way to do so (and it likely doesn't). To solve this problem, which is very common, especially in applications which use multiple libraries, the proper solution would be one of the following:\n• None Declare your own custom enum with all errors your application works with (or one subsystem of your application; granularity highly depends on the project), and declare conversions from all errors you work with to this enum type. As an extension of this approach, you can use (or , on which error-chain is basically based) to generate such custom types and conversions in a semi-automatic way.\n• None Use a special, generic error type. There are basically two of them: a. where is defined in the standard library. b. Use the type defined in the crate. Then the question mark operator will be able to convert any compatible error to one of these types because of various and trait implementations.\n\nNote that the crate is intended to be the way to define errors promoted in the Rust community. Not only does it provide a common error type and trait (which fixes various issues with the trait; see for example here), it also has facilities to define your own error types (for example, with ), and for tracking error context, causes and generating backtrace. Additionally, it tries to be as compatible with the existing error handling approaches as possible, therefore it can be used to integrate with libraries which use other, older approaches ( , , ) quite easily. So I strongly suggest you to consider using this crate first, before other options.\n\nI have already started using in my application projects, and I just can't express how much easier and nicer error handling has become. My approach is as follows:\n• None Use everywhere where an error can be returned, using the question mark operator ( ) to convert between errors and functions like or or to create my own error messages.\n\nI have yet to write a library using , but I imagine that for libraries it would be important to create more specific errors declared as an enum, which can be done with the crate. For applications, though, the type is more than enough."

        "document": "Most errors aren’t serious enough to require the program to stop entirely. Sometimes when a function fails it’s for a reason that you can easily interpret and respond to. For example, if you try to open a file and that operation fails because the file doesn’t exist, you might want to create the file instead of terminating the process.\n\nRecall from “Handling Potential Failure with ” in Chapter 2 that the enum is defined as having two variants, and , as follows:\n\nThe and are generic type parameters: we’ll discuss generics in more detail in Chapter 10. What you need to know right now is that represents the type of the value that will be returned in a success case within the variant, and represents the type of the error that will be returned in a failure case within the variant. Because has these generic type parameters, we can use the type and the functions defined on it in many different situations where the success value and error value we want to return may differ.\n\nLet’s call a function that returns a value because the function could fail. In Listing 9-3 we try to open a file.\n\nThe return type of is a . The generic parameter has been filled in by the implementation of with the type of the success value, , which is a file handle. The type of used in the error value is . This return type means the call to might succeed and return a file handle that we can read from or write to. The function call also might fail: for example, the file might not exist, or we might not have permission to access the file. The function needs to have a way to tell us whether it succeeded or failed and at the same time give us either the file handle or error information. This information is exactly what the enum conveys.\n\nIn the case where succeeds, the value in the variable will be an instance of that contains a file handle. In the case where it fails, the value in will be an instance of that contains more information about the kind of error that occurred.\n\nWe need to add to the code in Listing 9-3 to take different actions depending on the value returns. Listing 9-4 shows one way to handle the using a basic tool, the expression that we discussed in Chapter 6.\n\nNote that, like the enum, the enum and its variants have been brought into scope by the prelude, so we don’t need to specify before the and variants in the arms.\n\nWhen the result is , this code will return the inner value out of the variant, and we then assign that file handle value to the variable . After the , we can use the file handle for reading or writing.\n\nThe other arm of the handles the case where we get an value from . In this example, we’ve chosen to call the macro. If there’s no file named hello.txt in our current directory and we run this code, we’ll see the following output from the macro:\n\nAs usual, this output tells us exactly what has gone wrong.\n\nThe code in Listing 9-4 will no matter why failed. However, we want to take different actions for different failure reasons. If failed because the file doesn’t exist, we want to create the file and return the handle to the new file. If failed for any other reason—for example, because we didn’t have permission to open the file—we still want the code to in the same way it did in Listing 9-4. For this, we add an inner expression, shown in Listing 9-5.\n\nThe type of the value that returns inside the variant is , which is a struct provided by the standard library. This struct has a method that we can call to get an value. The enum is provided by the standard library and has variants representing the different kinds of errors that might result from an operation. The variant we want to use is , which indicates the file we’re trying to open doesn’t exist yet. So we match on , but we also have an inner match on .\n\nThe condition we want to check in the inner match is whether the value returned by is the variant of the enum. If it is, we try to create the file with . However, because could also fail, we need a second arm in the inner expression. When the file can’t be created, a different error message is printed. The second arm of the outer stays the same, so the program panics on any error besides the missing file error.\n\nShortcuts for Panic on Error: and\n\nUsing works well enough, but it can be a bit verbose and doesn’t always communicate intent well. The type has many helper methods defined on it to do various, more specific tasks. The method is a shortcut method implemented just like the expression we wrote in Listing 9-4. If the value is the variant, will return the value inside the . If the is the variant, will call the macro for us. Here is an example of in action:\n\nIf we run this code without a hello.txt file, we’ll see an error message from the call that the method makes:\n\nSimilarly, the method lets us also choose the error message. Using instead of and providing good error messages can convey your intent and make tracking down the source of a panic easier. The syntax of looks like this:\n\nWe use in the same way as : to return the file handle or call the macro. The error message used by in its call to will be the parameter that we pass to , rather than the default message that uses. Here’s what it looks like:\n\nIn production-quality code, most Rustaceans choose rather than and give more context about why the operation is expected to always succeed. That way, if your assumptions are ever proven wrong, you have more information to use in debugging.\n\nWhen a function’s implementation calls something that might fail, instead of handling the error within the function itself you can return the error to the calling code so that it can decide what to do. This is known as propagating the error and gives more control to the calling code, where there might be more information or logic that dictates how the error should be handled than what you have available in the context of your code.\n\nFor example, Listing 9-6 shows a function that reads a username from a file. If the file doesn’t exist or can’t be read, this function will return those errors to the code that called the function.\n\nThis function can be written in a much shorter way, but we’re going to start by doing a lot of it manually in order to explore error handling; at the end, we’ll show the shorter way. Let’s look at the return type of the function first: . This means the function is returning a value of the type , where the generic parameter has been filled in with the concrete type and the generic type has been filled in with the concrete type .\n\nIf this function succeeds without any problems, the code that calls this function will receive an value that holds a —the that this function read from the file. If this function encounters any problems, the calling code will receive an value that holds an instance of that contains more information about what the problems were. We chose as the return type of this function because that happens to be the type of the error value returned from both of the operations we’re calling in this function’s body that might fail: the function and the method.\n\nThe body of the function starts by calling the function. Then we handle the value with a similar to the in Listing 9-4. If succeeds, the file handle in the pattern variable becomes the value in the mutable variable and the function continues. In the case, instead of calling , we use the keyword to return early out of the function entirely and pass the error value from , now in the pattern variable , back to the calling code as this function’s error value.\n\nSo, if we have a file handle in , the function then creates a new in variable and calls the method on the file handle in to read the contents of the file into . The method also returns a because it might fail, even though succeeded. So we need another to handle that : if succeeds, then our function has succeeded, and we return the username from the file that’s now in wrapped in an . If fails, we return the error value in the same way that we returned the error value in the that handled the return value of . However, we don’t need to explicitly say , because this is the last expression in the function.\n\nThe code that calls this code will then handle getting either an value that contains a username or an value that contains an . It’s up to the calling code to decide what to do with those values. If the calling code gets an value, it could call and crash the program, use a default username, or look up the username from somewhere other than a file, for example. We don’t have enough information on what the calling code is actually trying to do, so we propagate all the success or error information upward for it to handle appropriately.\n\nThis pattern of propagating errors is so common in Rust that Rust provides the question mark operator to make this easier.\n\nListing 9-7 shows an implementation of that has the same functionality as in Listing 9-6, but this implementation uses the operator.\n\nThe placed after a value is defined to work in almost the same way as the expressions we defined to handle the values in Listing 9-6. If the value of the is an , the value inside the will get returned from this expression, and the program will continue. If the value is an , the will be returned from the whole function as if we had used the keyword so the error value gets propagated to the calling code.\n\nThere is a difference between what the expression from Listing 9-6 does and what the operator does: error values that have the operator called on them go through the function, defined in the trait in the standard library, which is used to convert values from one type into another. When the operator calls the function, the error type received is converted into the error type defined in the return type of the current function. This is useful when a function returns one error type to represent all the ways a function might fail, even if parts might fail for many different reasons.\n\nFor example, we could change the function in Listing 9-7 to return a custom error type named that we define. If we also define to construct an instance of from an , then the operator calls in the body of will call and convert the error types without needing to add any more code to the function.\n\nIn the context of Listing 9-7, the at the end of the call will return the value inside an to the variable . If an error occurs, the operator will return early out of the whole function and give any value to the calling code. The same thing applies to the at the end of the call.\n\nThe operator eliminates a lot of boilerplate and makes this function’s implementation simpler. We could even shorten this code further by chaining method calls immediately after the , as shown in Listing 9-8.\n\nWe’ve moved the creation of the new in to the beginning of the function; that part hasn’t changed. Instead of creating a variable , we’ve chained the call to directly onto the result of . We still have a at the end of the call, and we still return an value containing when both and succeed rather than returning errors. The functionality is again the same as in Listing 9-6 and Listing 9-7; this is just a different, more ergonomic way to write it.\n\nListing 9-9 shows a way to make this even shorter using .\n\nReading a file into a string is a fairly common operation, so the standard library provides the convenient function that opens the file, creates a new , reads the contents of the file, puts the contents into that , and returns it. Of course, using doesn’t give us the opportunity to explain all the error handling, so we did it the longer way first.\n\nWhere The Operator Can Be Used\n\nThe operator can only be used in functions whose return type is compatible with the value the is used on. This is because the operator is defined to perform an early return of a value out of the function, in the same manner as the expression we defined in Listing 9-6. In Listing 9-6, the was using a value, and the early return arm returned an value. The return type of the function has to be a so that it’s compatible with this .\n\nIn Listing 9-10, let’s look at the error we’ll get if we use the operator in a function with a return type that is incompatible with the type of the value we use on.\n\nThis code opens a file, which might fail. The operator follows the value returned by , but this function has the return type of , not . When we compile this code, we get the following error message:\n\nThis error points out that we’re only allowed to use the operator in a function that returns , , or another type that implements .\n\nTo fix the error, you have two choices. One choice is to change the return type of your function to be compatible with the value you’re using the operator on as long as you have no restrictions preventing that. The other choice is to use a or one of the methods to handle the in whatever way is appropriate.\n\nThe error message also mentioned that can be used with values as well. As with using on , you can only use on in a function that returns an . The behavior of the operator when called on an is similar to its behavior when called on a : if the value is , the will be returned early from the function at that point. If the value is , the value inside the is the resultant value of the expression, and the function continues. Listing 9-11 has an example of a function that finds the last character of the first line in the given text.\n\nThis function returns because it’s possible that there is a character there, but it’s also possible that there isn’t. This code takes the string slice argument and calls the method on it, which returns an iterator over the lines in the string. Because this function wants to examine the first line, it calls on the iterator to get the first value from the iterator. If is the empty string, this call to will return , in which case we use to stop and return from . If is not the empty string, will return a value containing a string slice of the first line in .\n\nThe extracts the string slice, and we can call on that string slice to get an iterator of its characters. We’re interested in the last character in this first line, so we call to return the last item in the iterator. This is an because it’s possible that the first line is the empty string; for example, if starts with a blank line but has characters on other lines, as in . However, if there is a last character on the first line, it will be returned in the variant. The operator in the middle gives us a concise way to express this logic, allowing us to implement the function in one line. If we couldn’t use the operator on , we’d have to implement this logic using more method calls or a expression.\n\nNote that you can use the operator on a in a function that returns , and you can use the operator on an in a function that returns , but you can’t mix and match. The operator won’t automatically convert a to an or vice versa; in those cases, you can use methods like the method on or the method on to do the conversion explicitly.\n\nSo far, all the functions we’ve used return . The function is special because it’s the entry point and exit point of an executable program, and there are restrictions on what its return type can be for the program to behave as expected.\n\nLuckily, can also return a . Listing 9-12 has the code from Listing 9-10, but we’ve changed the return type of to be and added a return value to the end. This code will now compile.\n\nThe type is a trait object, which we’ll talk about in the “Using Trait Objects that Allow for Values of Different Types” section in Chapter 18. For now, you can read to mean “any kind of error.” Using on a value in a function with the error type is allowed because it allows any value to be returned early. Even though the body of this function will only ever return errors of type , by specifying , this signature will continue to be correct even if more code that returns other errors is added to the body of .\n\nWhen a function returns a , the executable will exit with a value of if returns and will exit with a nonzero value if returns an value. Executables written in C return integers when they exit: programs that exit successfully return the integer , and programs that error return some integer other than . Rust also returns integers from executables to be compatible with this convention.\n\nThe function may return any types that implement the trait , which contains a function that returns an . Consult the standard library documentation for more information on implementing the trait for your own types.\n\nNow that we’ve discussed the details of calling or returning , let’s return to the topic of how to decide which is appropriate to use in which cases."

        "document": "Errors are a fact of life in software, so Rust has a number of features for handling situations in which something goes wrong. In many cases, Rust requires you to acknowledge the possibility of an error and take some action before your code will compile. This requirement makes your program more robust by ensuring that you’ll discover errors and handle them appropriately before you’ve deployed your code to production!\n\nRust groups errors into two major categories: recoverable and unrecoverable errors. For a recoverable error, such as a file not found error, we most likely just want to report the problem to the user and retry the operation. Unrecoverable errors are always symptoms of bugs, such as trying to access a location beyond the end of an array, and so we want to immediately stop the program.\n\nMost languages don’t distinguish between these two kinds of errors and handle both in the same way, using mechanisms such as exceptions. Rust doesn’t have exceptions. Instead, it has the type for recoverable errors and the macro that stops execution when the program encounters an unrecoverable error. This chapter covers calling first and then talks about returning values. Additionally, we’ll explore considerations when deciding whether to try to recover from an error or to stop execution."

        "document": "Rust is a systems programming language that provides a unique error-handling mechanism. In Rust, errors are categorized into two types: recoverable errors and unrecoverable errors. For recoverable errors, Rust provides the type to handle them.\n\nThe type is an enumeration with two variants: and . The variant represents a successful operation and contains a success value, whereas the variant represents a failed operation and contains an error value.\n\nBelow is the definition of the type:\n\nHere, represents the type of the success value, and represents the type of the error value.\n\nUses of the Type\n\nThe type is commonly used as a function return value. When a function executes successfully, it returns an variant; when it fails, it returns an variant.\n\nBelow is a simple example:\n\nIn this example, the function takes two arguments: a numerator and a denominator. If the denominator is , it returns the variant; otherwise, it returns the variant.\n\nIn the function, we call the function and use a statement to handle the return value. If the return value is , the result is printed; if it is , the error message is printed.\n\nHow to Handle Errors with\n\nWhen calling a function that returns a type, we need to handle potential errors. There are several ways to do this:\n\nThe statement is the most common way to handle type errors in Rust. It allows us to execute different operations based on the return value.\n\nIn this example, we use a statement to handle the return value of the function. If it returns , the result is printed; if it returns , the error message is printed.\n\nThe statement is a simplified version of . It can match only one case and does not require handling other cases. The statement is often used when we only care about one case of the type.\n\nIn this example, we use the statement to handle the return value of the function. If it returns , the result is printed; otherwise, nothing happens.\n\nThe operator is a special syntax in Rust that allows errors to be conveniently propagated from within a function. When calling a function that returns a type, the operator can simplify error handling.\n\nIn this example, the function calls the function internally and uses the operator to simplify error handling. If returns , will immediately return ; otherwise, execution continues.\n\nThe type provides several useful methods that make error handling more convenient.\n\nThe and methods check whether a is an or variant, respectively.\n\nIn this example, we use the method to check whether the return value of is . If so, we use to get the success value and print it; otherwise, we use to get the error message and print it.\n\nThe and methods retrieve the success or error value from a , respectively. If the is not of the expected variant, a panic occurs.\n\nIn this example, we use to get the success value of the function. If the return value is not , a panic will occur.\n\nThe and methods are similar to and , but they allow a custom error message to be specified. If the is not of the expected variant, a panic occurs and the specified message is printed.\n\nIn this example, we use to retrieve the success value of the function. If the return value is not , a panic occurs and the specified error message is printed.\n\nThe type has the following features and advantages:\n• Explicit error handling: The type forces programmers to explicitly handle errors, preventing them from being ignored or overlooked.\n• Type safety: The type is a generic type that can hold any type of success or error value, ensuring type safety and preventing type conversion errors.\n• Convenient error propagation: Rust provides the operator to easily propagate errors from a function.\n• Easy composition: The type provides various composition methods, such as , , , and , making it easier to combine multiple values.\n\nIn real-world code, we often define a custom error type and use the type to return error information.\n\nIn this example:\n• We define a custom error type , which includes two variants: and .\n• We define a type alias , setting as the error type.\n• The function takes two string arguments and attempts to parse them into . If parsing fails, the operator propagates the error. If the denominator is , an variant is returned; otherwise, the function returns .\n\nIn the function, we call and use a statement to handle the return value. If it returns , we print the result; if it returns , we print the error message.\n\nWhen working with file operations, various errors can occur, such as file not found or insufficient permissions. These errors can be handled using the type.\n\nIn this example:\n• The function takes a file path as an argument and uses to read the file content.\n• returns a type with a success value containing the file content and an error value of type .\n• In , we call and use to handle the return value. If it returns , the file content is printed; if it returns , the error message is printed.\n\nWhen making network requests, various errors can occur, such as connection timeouts or server errors. These errors can also be handled using the type.\n\nIn this example:\n• The function takes a host address as an argument and uses to establish a TCP connection.\n• returns a type with a success value of type and an error value of type .\n• In , we call and use to handle the return value. If it returns , the connection information is printed; if it returns , the error message is printed.\n\nBest Practices for and Error Handling\n\nWhen handling errors with , the following best practices can help write better code:\n• Use the operator to propagate errors: The operator makes it easy to propagate errors from a function.\n• Avoid excessive use of and : These methods cause a panic if an variant is encountered. Instead, handle errors properly using or .\n• Use composition methods to combine multiple values: Methods like , , , and help combine multiple values efficiently."

For recoverable errors, Rust provides the type to handle them.\n\nThe type is an enumeration with two variants: and . The variant represents a successful operation and contains a success value, whereas the variant represents a failed operation and contains an error value.\n\nBelow is the definition of the type:\n\n\n\nHere, represents the type of the success value, and represents the type of the error value.\n\nUses of the Type\n\nThe type is commonly used as a function return value. When a function executes successfully, it returns an variant; when it fails, it returns an variant.\n\nIn this example, the function takes two arguments: a numerator and a denominator. If the denominator is , it returns the variant; otherwise, it returns the variant.\n\nIn the function, we call the function and use a statement to handle the return value. If the return value is , the result is printed; if it is , the error message is printed.\n\nHow to Handle Errors with\n\nWhen calling a function that returns a type, we need to handle potential errors. There are several ways to do this:\n\nThe statement is the most common way to handle type errors in Rust. It allows us to execute different operations based on the return value.\n\nIn this example, we use a statement to handle the return value of the function. If it returns , the result is printed; if it returns , the error message is printed.\n\nThe statement is a simplified version of . It can match only one case and does not require handling other cases. The statement is often used when we only care about one case of the type.\n\nIn this example, we use the statement to handle the return value of the function. If it returns , the result is printed; otherwise, nothing happens.\n\nThe operator is a special syntax in Rust that allows errors to be conveniently propagated from within a function. When calling a function that returns a type, the operator can simplify error handling.\n\nIn this example, the function calls the function internally and uses the operator to simplify error handling. If returns , will immediately return ; otherwise, execution continues.\n\nThe type provides several useful methods that make error handling more convenient.\n\nThe and methods check whether a is an or variant, respectively.\n\nIn this example, we use the method to check whether the return value of is . If so, we use to get the success value and print it; otherwise, we use to get the error message and print it.\n\nThe and methods retrieve the success or error value from a , respectively. If the is not of the expected variant, a panic occurs.\n\nIn this example, we use to get the success value of the function. If the return value is not , a panic will occur.\n\nThe and methods are similar to and , but they allow a custom error message to be specified. If the is not of the expected variant, a panic occurs and the specified message is printed.\n\nIn this example, we use to retrieve the success value of the function. If the return value is not , a panic occurs and the specified error message is printed.\n\nThe type has the following features and advantages:\n• Explicit error handling: The type forces programmers to explicitly handle errors, preventing them from being ignored or overlooked.\n• Type safety: The type is a generic type that can hold any type of success or error value, ensuring type safety and preventing type conversion errors.\n• Convenient error propagation: Rust provides the operator to easily propagate errors from a function.\n• Easy composition: The type provides various composition methods, such as , , , and , making it easier to combine multiple values.\n\nIn real-world code, we often define a custom error type and use the type to return error information.\n\nIn this example:\n• We define a custom error type , which includes two variants: and .\n• We define a type alias , setting as the error type.\n• The function takes two string arguments and attempts to parse them into . If parsing fails, the operator propagates the error. If the denominator is , an variant is returned; otherwise, the function returns .\n\nIn the function, we call and use a statement to handle the return value. If it returns , we print the result; if it returns , we print the error message.\n\nWhen working with file operations, various errors can occur, such as file not found or insufficient permissions. These errors can be handled using the type.\n\nIn this example:\n• The function takes a file path as an argument and uses to read the file content.\n• returns a type with a success value containing the file content and an error value of type .\n• In , we call and use to handle the return value. If it returns , the file content is printed; if it returns , the error message is printed.\n\nWhen making network requests, various errors can occur, such as connection timeouts or server errors. These errors can also be handled using the type.\n\nIn this example:\n• The function takes a host address as an argument and uses to establish a TCP connection.\n• returns a type with a success value of type and an error value of type .\n• In , we call and use to handle the return value. If it returns , the connection information is printed; if it returns , the error message is printed.\n\nBest Practices for and Error Handling\n\nWhen handling errors with , the following best practices can help write better code:\n• Use the operator to propagate errors: The operator makes it easy to propagate errors from a function.\n• Avoid excessive use of and : These methods cause a panic if an variant is encountered. Instead, handle errors properly using or .\n• Use composition methods to combine multiple values: Methods like , , , and help combine multiple values efficiently.\n\nWe are Leapcell, your top choice for hosting Rust projects.\n\nLeapcell is the Next-Gen Serverless Platform for Web Hosting, Async Tasks, and Redis:\n• Develop with Node.js, Python, Go, or Rust.\n• pay only for usage — no requests, no charges.\n• Zero operational overhead — just focus on building.\n\nExplore more in the Documentation!"
