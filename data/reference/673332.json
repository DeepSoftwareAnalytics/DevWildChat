When an interpolated string is resolved to a result string, the compiler replaces items with interpolation expressions by the string representations of the expression results.\n\nString interpolation provides a more readable, convenient syntax to format strings. It's easier to read than string composite formatting. The following example uses both features to produce the same output:\n\nYou can use an interpolated string to initialize a constant string. You can do that only if all interpolation expressions within the interpolated string are constant strings as well.\n\nTo identify a string literal as an interpolated string, prepend it with the symbol. You can't have any white space between the and the that starts a string literal.\n\nThe structure of an item with an interpolation expression is as follows:\n\nElements in square brackets are optional. The following table describes each element:\n\nThe following example uses optional formatting components described in the preceding table:\n\nBeginning with C# 11, you can use new-lines within an interpolation expression to make the expression's code more readable. The following example shows how new-lines can improve the readability of an expression involving pattern matching:\n\nBeginning with C# 11, you can use an interpolated raw string literal, as the following example shows:\n\nTo embed and characters in the result string, start an interpolated raw string literal with multiple characters. When you do that, any sequence of or characters shorter than the number of characters is embedded in the result string. To enclose any interpolation expression within that string, you need to use the same number of braces as the number of characters, as the following example shows:\n\nIn the preceding example, an interpolated raw string literal starts with two characters. You need to put every interpolation expression between double braces ( and ). A single brace is embedded into a result string. If you need to embed repeated or characters into a result string, use an appropriately greater number of characters to designate an interpolated raw string literal. If the string literal has more repeated braces than the number of characters, the and characters are grouped from inside to outside. In the preceding example, the literal interprets and as interpolated expressions. The outer and are included verbatim in the output string.\n\nTo include a brace, \"{\" or \"}\", in the text produced by an interpolated string, use two braces, \"{{\" or \"}}\". For more information, see the Escaping braces section of the Composite formatting article.\n\nAs the colon (\":\") has special meaning in an interpolation expression item, to use a conditional operator in an interpolation expression. Enclose that expression in parentheses.\n\nThe following example shows how to include a brace in a result string. It also shows how to use a conditional operator:\n\nAn interpolated verbatim string starts with both the and characters. You can use and in any order: both and are valid interpolated verbatim strings. For more information about verbatim strings, see the string and verbatim identifier articles.\n\nBy default, an interpolated string uses the current culture defined by the CultureInfo.CurrentCulture property for all formatting operations.\n\nTo resolve an interpolated string to a culture-specific result string, use the String.Create(IFormatProvider, DefaultInterpolatedStringHandler) method, which is available beginning with .NET 6. The following example shows how to do that:\n\nIn .NET 5 and earlier versions of .NET, use implicit conversion of an interpolated string to a FormattableString instance. Then, you can use an instance FormattableString.ToString(IFormatProvider) method or a static FormattableString.Invariant method to produce a culture-specific result string. The following example shows how to do that:\n\nFor more information about custom formatting, see the Custom formatting with ICustomFormatter section of the Formatting types in .NET article.\n\nIf you're new to string interpolation, see the String interpolation in C# interactive tutorial. You can also check another String interpolation in C# tutorial. That tutorial demonstrates how to use interpolated strings to produce formatted strings.\n\nThe compiler checks if an interpolated string is assigned to a type that satisfies the interpolated string handler pattern. An interpolated string handler is a type that converts the interpolated string into a result string. When an interpolated string has the type , it's processed by the System.Runtime.CompilerServices.DefaultInterpolatedStringHandler. For the example of a custom interpolated string handler, see the Write a custom string interpolation handler tutorial. Use of an interpolated string handler is an advanced scenario, typically required for performance reasons.\n\nIf an interpolated string has the type , it's typically transformed into a String.Format method call. The compiler can replace String.Format with String.Concat if the analyzed behavior would be equivalent to concatenation.\n\nIf an interpolated string has the type IFormattable or FormattableString, the compiler generates a call to the FormattableStringFactory.Create method.\n\nFor more information, see the Interpolated string expressions section of the C# language specification and the following new feature specifications:\n• String interpolation in C# 10 and .NET 6 (.NET blog)"

Suppose we have a set of $(n+1)$ data points $(x_0, y_0), (x_1, y_1), \\ldots, (x_n, y_n)$ where all $x_i$ are distinct. The aim is to find a polynomial $L(x)$ of degree at most $n$ such that:\n\nInstead of solving a system of linear equations (as would be required if we used a general polynomial form), Lagrange interpolation provides a direct formula for the interpolating polynomial in terms of Lagrange basis polynomials. This approach is conceptually straightforward and does not require forming and solving large linear systems.\n\nImagine that you have three points $(x_0, y_0), (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)$. The Lagrange form builds a polynomial that goes exactly through these points. Each Lagrange basis polynomial $P_i(x)$ is constructed to be zero at all $x_j$ except $x_i$. By taking a suitable linear combination of these basis polynomials with weights given by $y_i$, we get an interpolating polynomial $L(x)$.\n\nThe Lagrange polynomial passing through all these points is unique and matches every given data point exactly.\n\nGiven $(n+1)$ distinct points $(x_0, y_0), (x_1, y_1), \\ldots, (x_n, y_n)$, the Lagrange interpolation polynomial is constructed as follows:\n\nFor each $i$ in ${0,1,\\ldots,n}$, define the $i$-th Lagrange basis polynomial $P_i(x)$ by:\n\nNotice that $P_i(x_k) = \\delta_{ik}$, where $\\delta_{ik}$ is the Kronecker delta. In other words:\n\nOnce we have the $P_i(x)$, the interpolating polynomial $L(x)$ is given by:\n\nBy construction, $L(x_j) = y_j$ for all $j$. The degree of $L(x)$ is at most $n$.\n\nStarting from the requirement that $L(x)$ matches all data points:\n\nThis construction ensures that for each fixed $i$:\n• When $x = x_i$, the numerator in $P_i(x)$ contains all factors $(x_i - x_j)$ for $j \n\neq i$, which exactly cancel with the denominator $(x_i - x_j)$. Thus, $P_i(x_i)=1$.\n• For $x = x_k$ with $k \n\neq i$, the factor $(x_k - x_k)$ in the numerator makes $P_i(x_k)=0$.\n\nHence $P_i(x)$ acts like a \"selector\" polynomial that equals 1 at $x_i$ and 0 at every other $x_j$.\n\nTo construct $L(x)$ that passes through all points, we form:\n\nsince $P_k(x_k)=1$ and $P_i(x_k)=0$ for $i \n\neq k$.\n\nA set of $(n+1)$ points $(x_i,y_i)$ with all $x_i$ distinct.\n• For each $j=0,1,\\ldots,n$ with $j \n\neq i$:\n\nThe polynomial $L(x)$ is the desired Lagrange interpolating polynomial. To interpolate at any $x$, just evaluate $L(x)$.\n\nWe have $n=2$ (since there are 3 points), and thus the polynomial $L(x)$ will be of degree at most 2.\n\nNow, plug these into $L(x)$:\n\nThis polynomial will exactly fit the three given points.\n\nThe Lagrange interpolation polynomial passes through all given data points exactly. There is no approximation error at these nodes.\n\nUnlike other polynomial interpolation techniques that require solving a system of equations, Lagrange interpolation provides a direct formula.\n\nThe formula for the interpolating polynomial is explicit and easy to implement.\n\nWorks for any set of points with distinct $x_i$.\n\nFor a large number of interpolation points, Lagrange interpolation may cause oscillations between the points, especially if the points are unevenly spaced.\n\nIf a new point is added, the entire polynomial must be recomputed from scratch, unlike some other forms (e.g., Newton’s divided differences) that allow incremental updates more easily.\n\nEvaluating Lagrange polynomials directly can be computationally intensive for large $n$ due to the product terms, though this can be mitigated with more efficient evaluation strategies."

When you try to add the 17th item to the , what happens is that a new array is allocated, that's (I think) twice the size of the old one, so 32 items.

However, this is micro-optimization and it's unlikely it will ever matter to you, but it's always nice to know what you're actually doing."

        "document": "You can store multiple variables of the same type in an array data structure. You declare an array by specifying the type of its elements. If you want the array to store elements of any type, you can specify as its type. In the unified type system of C#, all types, predefined and user-defined, reference types and value types, inherit directly or indirectly from Object.\n\nAn array is a reference type, so the array can be a nullable reference type. The element types might be reference types, so an array can be declared to hold nullable reference types. The following example declarations show the different syntax used to declare the nullability of the array or the elements:\n\nUninitialized elements in an array are set to the default value for that type:\n\nAn array has the following properties:\n• An array can be single-dimensional, multidimensional, or jagged.\n• The number of dimensions are set when an array variable is declared. The length of each dimension is established when the array instance is created. These values can't be changed during the lifetime of the instance.\n• A jagged array is an array of arrays, and each member array has the default value of .\n• Arrays are zero indexed: an array with elements is indexed from to .\n• Array elements can be of any type, including an array type.\n• Array types are reference types derived from the abstract base type Array. All arrays implement IList and IEnumerable. You can use the foreach statement to iterate through an array. Single-dimensional arrays also implement IList<T> and IEnumerable<T>.\n\nThe elements of an array can be initialized to known values when the array is created. Beginning with C# 12, all of the collection types can be initialized using a Collection expression. Elements that aren't initialized are set to the default value. The default value is the 0-bit pattern. All reference types (including non-nullable types), have the values . All value types have the 0-bit patterns. That means the Nullable<T>.HasValue property is and the Nullable<T>.Value property is undefined. In the .NET implementation, the property throws an exception.\n\nThe following example creates single-dimensional, multidimensional, and jagged arrays:\n\nA single-dimensional array is a sequence of like elements. You access an element via its index. The index is its ordinal position in the sequence. The first element in the array is at index . You create a single-dimensional array using the new operator specifying the array element type and the number of elements. The following example declares and initializes single-dimensional arrays:\n\nThe first declaration declares an uninitialized array of five integers, from to . The elements of the array are initialized to the default value of the element type, for integers. The second declaration declares an array of strings and initializes all seven values of that array. A series of statements prints all the elements of the array. For single-dimensional arrays, the statement processes elements in increasing index order, starting with index 0 and ending with index .\n\nYou can pass an initialized single-dimensional array to a method. In the following example, an array of strings is initialized and passed as an argument to a method for strings. The method displays the elements of the array. Next, the method reverses the array elements, and then the method modifies the first three elements of the array. After each method returns, the method shows that passing an array by value doesn't prevent changes to the array elements.\n\nArrays can have more than one dimension. For example, the following declarations create four arrays. Two arrays have have two dimensions. Two arrays have three dimensions. The first two declarations declare the length of each dimension, but don't initialize the values of the array. The second two declarations use an initializer to set the values of each element in the multidimensional array.\n\nFor multi-dimensional arrays, elements are traversed such that the indices of the rightmost dimension are incremented first, then the next left dimension, and so on, to the leftmost index. The following example enumerates both a 2D and a 3D array:\n\nIn a 2D array, you can think of the left index as the row and the right index as the column.\n\nHowever, with multidimensional arrays, using a nested for loop gives you more control over the order in which to process the array elements:\n\nYou pass an initialized multidimensional array to a method in the same way that you pass a one-dimensional array. The following code shows a partial declaration of a print method that accepts a two-dimensional array as its argument. You can initialize and pass a new array in one step, as is shown in the following example. In the following example, a two-dimensional array of integers is initialized and passed to the method. The method displays the elements of the array.\n\nA jagged array is an array whose elements are arrays, possibly of different sizes. A jagged array is sometimes called an \"array of arrays.\" Its elements are reference types and are initialized to . The following examples show how to declare, initialize, and access jagged arrays. The first example, , is declared in one statement. Each contained array is created in subsequent statements. The second example, is declared and initialized in one statement. It's possible to mix jagged and multidimensional arrays. The final example, , is a declaration and initialization of a single-dimensional jagged array that contains three two-dimensional array elements of different sizes.\n\nA jagged array's elements must be initialized before you can use them. Each of the elements is itself an array. It's also possible to use initializers to fill the array elements with values. When you use initializers, you don't need the array size.\n\nThis example builds an array whose elements are themselves arrays. Each one of the array elements has a different size.\n\nYou can create an implicitly typed array in which the type of the array instance is inferred from the elements specified in the array initializer. The rules for any implicitly typed variable also apply to implicitly typed arrays. For more information, see Implicitly Typed Local Variables.\n\nThe following examples show how to create an implicitly typed array:\n\nIn the previous example, notice that with implicitly typed arrays, no square brackets are used on the left side of the initialization statement. Also, jagged arrays are initialized by using just like single-dimensional arrays.\n\nWhen you create an anonymous type that contains an array, the array must be implicitly typed in the type's object initializer. In the following example, is an implicitly typed array of anonymous types, each of which contains an array named . The keyword isn't used inside the object initializers."

Be it gaming or business software, understanding arrays, and above all, array length plays a vital role in coding. This guide gives you a better insight into ‘Array Length in C#’. Ready? Let’s dive in!\n\nWhen you look around, can’t you see we live in a world of arrays? Just like a bookshelf full of books, an array is a collection of similar type items stacked together.\n\nBasics of Arrays in C#\n\nIn C#, arrays work as a data structure to store the elements of the same data type together. All elements of the array share the same name, but they’re distinguished based on their indexes (oh yeah, like your books!).\n\nThe above example effortlessly creates an integer array ‘NumArray’ with a size of 5.\n\nYou might be itching to know how to create arrays in C#! Never fear, we’re here to take you through it!\n\nA Tutorial on How to Create Arrays in C#\n\nCreating arrays in C# is just like painting a picture, it’s all about choosing the right colors (or data types in coding language!).\n\nJust like you create a beautiful blend of colors on a canvas, the above code creates two arrays, ‘array1’ of type integer and ‘array2’ of type character.\n\nWorking with Array Length in C#\n\nRemember when you were having a pizza party and you needed to know exactly how many slices you had to ensure everyone gets their share? That’s where ‘length’ steps in even in coding!\n\nHow To Get Length Of Array In C#\n\nJust like counting pizza slices, determining the length of an array in C# is a cakewalk with the ‘Length’ property.\n\nIn the above code, we’ve determined the length of our array ‘NumArray’ to be 5. Easy-peasy, isn’t it?\n\nMore about Array Length in C#\n\nThe real fun begins when you start playing with array length in C#. Are you excited to unravel the mystery of finding the length of an array?\n\nDigging Deeper: How to Find Length of Array in C#\n\nFinding the length of an array in C# is like finding a needle in a haystack. Right? Nope, not really!\n\nThis code effortlessly reveals the length of ‘array1’ as 5.\n\nThe Length Property in C# Arrays\n\nThe ‘Length’ property in C# acts as a fundamental tool when dealing with arrays. No cloak and dagger act, just plain and simple usage to get the total number of elements present in an array. Have you ever wondered how it works? Let’s explore further together.\n\nUnderstanding the Length Property of Arrays in C#\n\nThough it seems mysterious, the Length property in C# possesses an uncomplicated mechanism. Acting like a built-in function, it grants us permission to fetch the total count of elements present in an array.\n\nThe above code snippet uses the ‘Length’ property to calculate the length of ‘array1’, which, in this case, will print ‘5’.\n\nBut let’s shape it more interestingly. The ‘Length’ property comes real handy when you need to iterate over the array elements.\n\nThis code would iterate over ‘array1’ and print both the index and value of every array element. So simple, yet so practical.\n\nNow, let’s look at more practical examples using the Length property. Practical demonstrations help strengthen concepts and are instrumental in mastering them.\n\nCreating and Determining Length of an Array: A Practical Example\n\nLet’s create an array of characters and find out its length. Imagine you are asked to count the total number of alphabets in the English language. Wouldn’t it be so much easier with arrays and the ‘Length’ property?\n\nThe above code creates a character array ‘charArray’ with all 26 English alphabets and prints out the length, giving ’26’. Instead of manually counting each alphabet, C# does it in a flash!\n\nWhile working with different array types, handling character arrays becomes quite the routine. Let’s deepen our knowledge about character arrays.\n\nFor character arrays, the ‘Length’ property operates similarly as it does for other arrays. Let’s see an example to cement this concept.\n\nThe code snippet creates a vowels array and fetches its length. The result ‘5’ signifies that there are five vowels in the English language.\n\nImportance of Array Length in C#\n\nKnowing the length of your data structures, particularly arrays, in a language like C# is akin to understanding the ABCs of programming. A clear understanding of array length in C# is like a master key that unlocks many paths in your coding journey.\n\nWhy Understanding Array Length in C# is Vital\n\nKnowing the length of an array has numerous crucial applications in the world of coding:\n• Looping through Arrays: Array-length is crucial when you want to navigate through each element within the array. Let’s consider a scenario where you are creating a leaderboard for a game and you have stored the player’s scores in an array. You would need an accurate length of the array to loop through each player’s scores.\n\nHere, we utilize the array length while setting the condition for our loop.\n• Preventing Errors: One common error involving arrays is the ‘out-of-bounds’ error, which occurs when you attempt to access an index that is not within the array’s range. Understanding array length leads you to dodge these errors. Always remember the highest index you can access in an array is always ‘length-1’.\n\nIn the above example, we accessed the last element in the array using ‘numberArray.Length – 1’.\n• Memory Optimization: Knowing the size of an array is essential for memory management and ensuring the optimal performance of your application. Creating an array with a larger-than-required capacity results in the wastage of memory resources, while insufficient size leads to constant resizing or ‘out of bounds’ errors.\n\nIn the example above, we create an array with an exact size needed, leading to efficient memory usage.\n\nYour coding journey will often be a bumpy ride filled with bugs and errors – not all humans were meant to decode ‘machine language’. But fret not, knowing your way around the commonly encountered issues will make the ride smoother!\n\nOne such commonly encountered hiccup is the ‘IndexOutOfRangeException’. It usually surfaces when you play on the edges – trying to access an array index which doesn’t exist.\n\nIn the above code, we tried to access index 6 of ‘scoreArray’. But hey, look closely, ‘scoreArray’ only goes till index 4! This raises an ‘IndexOutOfRangeException’. However, by wrapping the code block within a ‘try-catch’ block, we gracefully handle the exception and prevent any abrupt termination of the program.\n\nWrapping up With Array Length in C#\n\nArray length in C# is not as complicated as quantum physics, right? From creating arrays, dealing with array length to handling exceptions, I hope this guidebook on ‘Array Length in C#’ steers you on your journey in the coding world. Remember, “Success is a journey, not a destination” (Arthur Ashe). So keep practicing, keep learning. Ready for your next coding adventure?"

        "document": "Arrays are used for ordered elements. In JSON, each element in an array may be of a different type.\n\nIn Python, \"array\" is analogous to the list or tuple type, depending on usage. However, the json module in the Python standard library will always use Python lists to represent JSON arrays.\n\nThere are two ways in which arrays are generally used in JSON:\n• List validation: a sequence of arbitrary length where each item matches the same schema.\n• Tuple validation: a sequence of fixed length where each item may have a different schema. In this usage, the index (or location) of each item is meaningful as to how the value is interpreted. (This usage is often given a whole separate type in some programming languages, such as Python's ).\n\nList validation is useful for arrays of arbitrary length where each item matches the same schema. For this kind of array, set the keyword to a single schema that will be used to validate all of the items in the array.\n\nIn the following example, we define that each item in an array is a number:\n\nA single \"non-number\" causes the whole array to be invalid:\n\nThe empty array is always valid:\n\nTuple validation is useful when the array is a collection of items where each has a different schema and the ordinal index of each item is meaningful.\n\nFor example, you may represent a street address such as as a 4-tuple of the form:\n\nEach of these fields will have a different schema:\n• : The address number. Must be a number.\n• : The name of the street. Must be a string.\n• : The type of street. Should be a string from a fixed set of values.\n• : The city quadrant of the address. Should be a string from a different set of values.\n\nTo do this, we use the keyword. is an array, where each item is a schema that corresponds to each index of the document's array. That is, an array where the first element validates the first element of the input array, the second element validates the second element of the input array, etc.\n\n\"Drive\" is not one of the acceptable street types:\n\nIt's okay to not provide all of the items:\n\nAnd, by default, it's also okay to add additional items to end:\n\nThe keyword can be used to control whether it's valid to have additional items in a tuple beyond what is defined in . The value of the keyword is a schema that all additional items must pass in order for the keyword to validate.\n\nHere, we'll reuse the example schema above, but set to , which has the effect of disallowing extra items in the tuple.\n\nIt's ok to not provide all of the items:\n\nBut, since is , we can't provide extra items:\n\nYou can express more complex constraints by using a non-boolean schema to constrain what value additional items can have. In that case, we could say that additional items are allowed, as long as they are all strings:\n\n... but not anything else\n\nThe keyword is useful mainly when you want to add or disallow extra items to an array.\n\napplies to any values not evaluated by an , , or keyword. Just as affects only properties in an object, affects only items in an array.\n\nLike with , if you set to , you can disallow extra items in the array.\n\nHere, all the values are evaluated. The schema passes validation.\n\nBut here, the schema fails validation because specifies that no extra values should exist.\n\nNote that doesn't \"see inside\" any instances of , , or in the same subschema. So in this next example, ignores and thus fails to validate.\n\nBut if you replace with , then the same array validates.\n\nYou can also make a \"half-closed\" schema: something useful when you want to keep the first two arguments, but also add more in certain situations. (\"Closed\" to two arguments in some places, \"open\" to more arguments when you need it to be.)\n\nHere the schema is \"closed\" to two array items. You can then later use and add another item like this:\n\nThus, you would reference when you need only two items and reference when you need three items.\n\nWhile the schema must be valid for every item in the array, the schema only needs to validate against one or more items in the array.\n\nA single \"number\" is enough to make this pass:\n\nBut if we have no number, it fails:\n\nAll numbers is, of course, also okay:\n\nand can be used with to further specify how many times a schema matches a constraint. These keywords can be any non-negative number including zero.\n\nThe length of the array can be specified using the and keywords. The value of each keyword must be a non-negative number. These keywords work whether doing list validation or tuple-validation.\n\nA schema can ensure that each of the items in an array is unique. Simply set the keyword to ."
