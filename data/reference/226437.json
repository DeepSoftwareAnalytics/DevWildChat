Ask our team of expert engineers and get a specific answer!\n\nYou need to see DPS gear in action. Get a live demo with our engineers.\n\nWhat is Modbus RS232 and Modbus RS485\n\nIf you're asking yourself what the Modbus and RS-485 difference (or RS-232) is, let's start by understanding that Modbus is a protocol for Modbus messages.\n\nBrief Overview of Modbus RS-232 and RS-485\n\nModbus Remote Monitoring and Control traditionally uses RS-232 and RS-485 Modbus communication protocols for collecting data from Modbus slaves. Of the two, Modbus using the RS-485 protocol is more common than RS-232 due to its support for multi-drop communication.\n\nThese transports are not in any way limited to Modbus, of course. They're found in a wide variety of other applications. Modbus is just one possible protocol that can be sent via dedicated serial connection.\n\nModbus is a protocol that (traditionally) uses serial communication lines. Modbus over serial connects the master to Modbus slave devices for collecting register and coil information.\n\nModbus/TCP was introduced for LAN installations but Modbus over traditional serial transmission networks is still found in many industrial applications and building automation systems. A Modbus master can communicate with up to 247 Modbus Remote Telemetry Units (RTUs) or Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs). It uses a unique Modbus address assigned to each RTU.\n\nModbus via RS-232 sends data in the form of a time-series of bits. It is a standard for communication between data terminal and data circuit termination equipment. Full duplex transmission (Tx) and receive (Rx) for data occurs on different circuits when using Modbus RS-232 lines. That means that data is able to flow both ways at the same time.\n\nModbus RS 485 Is Half-Duplex and Indicates Values Using Differences in Voltage\n\nModbus RTU RS485 interface is similar, but different, from RS-232. This two-wire, multi-point connection communicates serial data by indicating values by sending different voltages across the two wires. These differences between these voltages are related to one and zero values, which make up the Modbus 485 communications.\n\nAdvantages of Using RS-485 Over RS-232\n• Supports several devices on the same bus (multi-drop): Unlike RS-232, which typically only allows point-to-point connections, RS-485 can manage multiple devices on a single network. This capability makes it ideal for complex systems requiring extensive connectivity.\n• Less susceptible to noise than RS-232: RS-485's differential signaling reduces susceptibility to electrical noise, ensuring more reliable data transmission in environments with significant interference.\n• Works over longer distances: RS-485 can communicate over much greater distances than RS-232, making it suitable for applications where devices are spread out over large areas.\n• Supports faster transfer speeds than RS-232: The increased data transfer speeds of RS-485 facilitate quicker communications, essential for time-sensitive applications.\n\nBy understanding these key advantages, it's clear why RS-485 is preferred in many industrial and commercial settings. Its robust capabilities and versatile applications make it a superior choice for sophisticated communication requirements.\n\nWhat Are the Disadvantages of Using RS-485 Compared to RS-232?\n\nWhen considering RS-485 as an option over the more commonly known RS-232, there are several drawbacks to keep in mind.\n• Limited Adoption: RS-485 isn't as universally embraced as RS-232, potentially leading to compatibility issues with some devices and systems which are more accustomed to the latter.\n• Additional Components Needed: Installation of RS-485 requires termination resistors to prevent signal reflection, adding complexity and cost to the setup.\n• Communication Constraints: Unlike RS-232, RS-485 only supports half-duplex communication. This means data can only be sent or received at one time, not both simultaneously, which could slow down processes that require frequent data exchanges.\n\nThese factors can complicate the decision-making process if ease of use and widespread compatibility are key considerations for your application.\n\nLegacy Gear: Using Modbus to Monitor a Generator Controller in Your Network\n\nSeveral DPS clients use Generac, Caterpillar, Kohler, and other generators. They wanted us to interface RS232 / RS485 serial Modbus connection to the generator controller. Also possible is to use DPS' D-Wire propane monitoring sensors to report back to a NetGuardian RTU.\n\nModbus for Remote Monitoring and Data Acquisition of Client-Premise Devices\n\nAnother client needed remote monitoring and data acquisition for devices they sell to their customers. Their primary business is measuring liquid in tanks (refineries, petrochemical plants, etc.). They have digital inputs (magnetic switches) in their existing management system.\n\nFor decades, their customers have put a mechanical device on the tank. The problem is that wiring is expensive to install and maintain. Over the years, they've installed several radio systems, but the radios are typically 900mhz/2.4ghz spread spectrum.\n\nWith GSM reporting from a modern monitoring device, the options multiply. We could enable customers to get the data not just in their own office, but also from almost anywhere else in the world.\n\nThe tank sensors themselves are analog. There is some intelligence in the enclosure that's an RS-485 or Modbus RS-232 converter, which converts analogs to Modbus. This client came to DPS looking for one small, GSM-capable, and inexpensive Modbus RTU on each tank. They would also need a central collector of some kind (T/Mon).\n\nAs you can see, Modbus projects tend to involve a lot of other protocols and equipment.\n\nWorking With Modbus in an increasingly IP & SNMP Driven World\n\nIf you work in telecom, you probably have trouble with any remote RS 485 Modbus equipment. The world has shifted more and more to Ethernet IP, T1, fiber, and other modern transport standards. Dedicated serial lines are tough (and expensive!) to maintain. Wouldn't it be nice to route serial traffic over IP? Then you could keep you old-but-still-functional Modbus gear but abandon the aging serial transport.\n\nOne excellent new solution to this problem is a remote Modbus-to-SNMP mediator. This is a fairly simple box that takes in serial Modbus (RS-232 or RS-485) and converts the message to standard SNMP traps. These can be received by your SNMP manager. Because the mediator box is modern, you benefit from recent innovations like SNMPv3.\n\nUnlike earlier versions of SNMP, SNMPv3 is secured with encryption. For many organizations, this is level of security is needed whenever data will be sent via IP.\n\nIf serial transport isn't your problem, but you still want to integrate Modbus into your SNMP umbrella, you can take a different route. This involves using a Modbus mediating master station to convert inbound Modbus to SNMP. This single stream of usable SNMP traps can be easily sent to your preferred SNMP manager. This master-station solution will generally be much less expensive than installing individual mediation devices at each of your remote sites.\n\nWork With a Capable Manufacturer to Get the Exact Modbus Solution You Need\n\nIf you work with any kind of legacy equipment, including serial interfacing Modbus device, you need very specialized gear to make it work in today's networks. That's where your choice of manufacturer comes in. Some just sell commodities, and if you need a very unique solution, you're out of luck.\n\nWhat you need to get a custom Modbus solution is a manufacturer who can take a proven design and adjust it to fit your needs. Look for a company that does its own engineering and manufacturing. They need in-house teams in those areas to be responsive to your special requests. Otherwise, they'll have a really hard time meeting your specs without an insane minimum order.\n\nA company that farms out everything except for their \"core competency\" simply can't react with the speed that an integrated company can. You need a manufacturer whose core competency is being flexible and giving you exactly the Modbus solution you need.\n\nDo you have specific Modbus requirements? Maybe you need an RTU that can act a Modbus RS485 and RS232 to Modbus converter, or just RS232 to Modbus TCP, or maybe even Modbus TCP to RS232. If that's your case, our custom-designed monitoring solutions can help you."

        "document": "The growth of Internet of Things (IoT) applications has increased the need for temperature sensors in consumer, residential, commercial, and industrial situations. While temperature may well be the most commonly measured physical variable, measuring it often presents challenges in terms of sensor type, as well as maintaining performance over time and environmental changes. The classic temperature sensing technologies include thermistors, thermocouples, and resistance temperature detectors (RTDs). This article will describe the challenges facing designers when it comes to temperature measurement, and then compare these three sensing options. It will then describe a fourth option: solid state temperature sensors. It will proceed to introduced suitable solid state temperature solutions and show how they can be used to meet IoT temperature measurement requirements. The ongoing challenge of measuring temperature Although temperature is easy to measure in principle, doing so effectively can be difficult in practice due to reasons of sensor accuracy, placement, power consumption, and the number of locations to be measured. Accuracy: Some IoT applications need performance to just ±2°C, while ±1°C is most common, though some precision applications may need higher performance to ±0.5°C or better. Placement: The actual siting of the sensor is often a dilemma, including how far can it be from the point of interest yet not degrade reading integrity, while also taking wire lengths into consideration. Power consumption: Many IoT applications operate from a limited power source such as a long-life battery or energy harvesting. Number of sensed locations: Some situations need to monitor only one or two points while others need to measure many more. This creates communication and cost issues, while adding to placement complexity and power consumption concerns. Traditional sensors may not be a good fit Thermocouples, RTDs, and thermistors are in wide use and are well suited for wired, non-IoT applications, as well as those where power is readily available. However, their primary attributes may be incompatible with diverse and dispersed IoT installations. This is the case despite the many high function interface ICs available to support them and designers’ in-depth experience in their application. Each of these three approaches have their pros and cons: Thermocouples can provide excellent accuracy over a very wide range of temperatures to thousands of degrees, but require an auxiliary ambient temperature sensor for cold junction compensation (CJC). They also require sophisticated interface circuitry. The resistance temperature detector (RTD) is also quite accurate and has a fairly linear temperature versus resistance transfer function. However, it requires tens of milliamps of drive current and sophisticated drive and readout circuitry. It is also relatively expensive due to its use of platinum. Thermistors have a high change in resistance per degree of temperature change, which provides enhanced resolution. They are accurate and stable, and their small size results in a small thermal mass, resulting in a fast response time. However, unlike thermocouples and RTDs, there are no industry standards for their response curves, which is both good and bad. There are many thermistor types and ranges among which to choose, but interchangeability and replacement can be problematic. Table 1 summarizes the key characteristics and attributes of thermocouples, RTDs, and thermistors, while Table 2 compares their relative strengths and weakness. As always, there is no single “best” temperature sensor, as each type represents a tradeoff of characteristics versus application objectives and priorities. Sensor Type Thermistor RTD Thermocouple Temperature Range (typical) -100°C to +325°C -200°C to +650°C +200°C to +1750°C Accuracy (typical) 0.05°C 1.5°C 0.1°C to 1°C 0.5°C to 5°C Long-term stability at 100°C 0.2°C/year 0.05°C/year Variable Linearity Exponential Fairly linear Non-linear Power required Constant voltage or current Constant voltage or current Self-powered Response time Fast: 0.12 s to 10 s Generally slow: 1 s to 50 s Fast: 0.10 s to 10 s Susceptibility to electrical noise Rarely susceptible High resistance only Rarely susceptible Susceptible / Cold junction compensation Cost Low to moderate High Low Table 1: The three widely used, traditional temperature sensors – thermocouple, RTD, and thermistor – have very different primary performance attributes. (Image source: Omega Engineering Inc.) Sensor Type Advantages Disadvantages Thermocouple Temperature Range Self-powered No self-heating Rugged Cold-junction compensation Accuracy Stability TC extension leads RTD Accuracy Stability Linearity Lead resistance error Response time Vibration resistance Size Thermistor Sensitivity Accuracy Cost Rugged Hermetic seal Surface-mount Non-linearity Self heating Narrow ranges Table 2: A comparison of basic attributes shows thermocouples, RTDs, and thermistors each have a role to play depending upon the application requirements. (Image source: Omega Engineering Inc.) The inherent nonlinearity of thermocouples and thermistors mean that they require linearization (Figure 1). This can be accomplished via all-analog circuitry (less common in most new designs), a look-up table in memory, or an algorithm which provides a correcting calculation. However, doing this adds to the challenges of using them in basic IoT and multichannel applications. Graph of system using a thermocouple, RTD, or thermistor Figure 1: A system using a thermocouple, RTD, or thermistor must compensate for their inherent nonlinearities, which differs in both the general shape of each type and specific models. (Image source: Omega Engineering Inc.) While each of the advantages of thermistors, RTDs, and thermocouples make them ideal for specific applications, designers of IoT applications need a more generic solution. This implies one that can be quickly deployed at low cost and can maintain accuracy, performance, and response time in typical semiconductor application environments. As the numbers of sensors that need to be connected increases, ease of communication and configuration is also required. These are some of the reasons why a solid state approach to sensing is proving to be attractive to IoT device designers. Solid state sensors fit the IoT template The concept of solid state sensors is not new, but it has been developed and improved dramatically over the years. The sensors begin with the well-known ideal diode equation which defines the relationship among diode current, voltage, and temperature, per Equation 1: Equation 1Equation 1 The thermal voltage Vt of a diode is the voltage developed across the P-N junction due to the effect of temperature. It is about 26 millivolts (mV) at room temperature. It is this relationship between thermal voltage and temperature which allows a diode to be used as the core of a temperature sensor. However, the inherent and unavoidable nonlinearity of this relationship makes a basic diode difficult to use and act as a calibrated sensor. The addition of on-chip linearization circuitry allows solid state sensors to function as an effective choice for IoT applications. By adding components around the diode, these difficulties can be overcome to a point where the diode-based sensor is an attractive option. The first mass market diode-based temperature IC was the AD590 from Analog Devices (Figure 2). This was first introduced several decades ago but has proven to be so useful that it is still available today in a wide range of packages, including two-lead through-hole flatpack, dual inline package (DIP), and a tiny surface mount housing. Image of AD590 from Analog Devices Figure 2: The AD590 from Analog Devices is a two-terminal current sourcing temperature sensor that produces a linear 1 μA/K current proportional to absolute temperature. Here it is shown in a flatpack package with wire leads. (Image source: Analog Devices) The sensor acts as a simple temperature dependent current source that produces an analog output current of 1 μA/K proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT). This output is laser trimmed to calibrate the device to deliver 298.2 μA at 298.2 K (25°C). The current output is relatively immune to noise and can be used in long wire runs, similar to a 4 - 20 mA current loop. The AD590 operates from a +4 to +30 volt source, which is applied via the current output leads. Versions are available to meet accuracy specifications ranging from ±2°C down to ±0.5°C, over the -55°C to 150°C operating range. Many IoT applications only require a limited and perhaps less accurate reading, so a less costly version would be suitable. In the decades since the AD590 series was introduced, many variations based on the original concept have been introduced. For example, in many designs, the basic current output is inconvenient because it requires a current-to-voltage or current-to-digital conversion to be useful. These factors led to the introduction of such sensors such as the Analog Devices AD22100. This provides a linear voltage output proportional to temperature × V+, with a temperature coefficient of 22.5 mV/°C (Figure 3). No trimming is required over the -55°C to 150°C range. Accuracy is at least ±2% of full scale, while linearity is better than ±1% of full scale. Functional block diagram of the Analog Devices AD22100 Figure 3: This functional block diagram of the AD22100 shows how the temperature dependent current output is converted into a precisely scaled voltage via its internal op amp. (Image source: Analog Devices) Due to its ratiometric nature, it is easy to interface the AD22100 to an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) by using the AD22100’s 5 volt power supply as a reference for the ADC (Figure 4). This eliminates the need for a precision voltage reference. With a single +5.0 V supply, the output ranges from 0.25 V at −50°C to +4.75 V at +150°C. Diagram of Analog Devices AD22100 solid state sensor Figure 4: The voltage output of the Analog Devices AD22100 solid state sensor is well suited to interface directly to an ADC. (Image source: Analog Devices) Other diode-based solid state sensors are available which include the A/D converter, usually with an I2C or SMBus interface to the system processor. As temperature is a relatively slowly changing variable, the converter can be slow with high resolution (18 to 22 bits) and operate at very low power. These can be effective solutions when only one or a few channels are needed. In applications where many channels are needed, such as monitoring various possible “hot spots” in a system, it may be sensible to employ low-cost sensors and share the conversion circuitry. The least expensive sensor available is the basic diode (in practice the diode junction of a low-performance transistor), but its nonlinearities make it difficult to use. To overcome these concerns, ICs such as Microchip Technology’s EMC181x series support multiple transistors and add needed features to make the transistor’s diode output linear and accurate, while also digitizing it. When external transistors are added, devices in this family (EMC1812/13/14/15/33) function as high accuracy, 2-wire multichannel temperature sensors with an SMBus/I2C interface (Figure 5). Diagram of Microchip Technology EMC181x family of interface ICs Figure 5: The Microchip Technology EMC181x family of interface ICs has one internal diode (transistor) sensor and between one and four external diode sensors. This greatly simplifies the task of multichannel measurement by minimizing wiring and interface components. (Image source: Microchip Technology Inc.) Each IC in the series includes an internal temperature sensor (±1°C maximum accuracy, -40°C to +125°C) as well as connections for external sensing channels. The EMC1812 has one external diode channel, up to the EMC1815 which has four external channels. To ensure accuracy and avoid the need for calibration, these ICs include several advanced features. For example, resistance error correction (REC) automatically eliminates the temperature error caused by lead series resistance, allowing for greater flexibility in routing the sensing diodes. Another feature, called beta compensation, eliminates temperature errors caused by low, variable beta transistors that are widely available. The result is ±1°C measurement accuracy and 0.125°C resolution for the external diode readings. Integration brings more processing and configuration flexibility The EMC181x series goes beyond just measurement and reporting to a system processor. They include features which offload a processor from the need to keep checking on temperature, such as user-settable per-channel threshold alerts and rate-of-change measurement alerts, yet the internal complexity of these ICs is transparent to the user (Figure 6). As a result, the processor burden of monitoring and judging the situation across the multiple reading points is greatly reduced while user flexibility is retained. Diagram of Microchip EMC181x family of ICs (click to enlarge) Figure 6: Within the EMC181x family of ICs are registers for storing user-set per-channel values for thresholds and trend alarms. (Image source: Microchip Technology Inc.) Solid state sensor ICs can also be designed to provide higher accuracy than the more common ±0.5 to ±1°C rating of most such devices. A good example of this is the TMP117 from Texas Instruments (Figure 7). Diagram of TMP117 from Texas Instruments Figure 7: With its guaranteed accuracy of ±0.1°C from -20°C to 50°C, the TMP117 from Texas Instruments is certified to meet critical medical standards; it is also well suited for the many IoT applications with limited range-span needs. (Image source: Texas Instruments) This is a high precision digital temperature sensor targeted at (but not limited to) electronic patient thermometers. For this application it is designed and qualified to ASTM E1112 and ISO 80601 requirements. Other applications include environmental monitoring, high-performance thermostats, wearables, asset tracking, cold chain monitoring, and gas/heat meters. The TMP117 provides a 16-bit temperature result with a resolution of 0.0078°C (18-bits) and an accuracy of up to ±0.1°C across the temperature range of -20°C to 50°C with no need for calibration. This is a relatively limited range, but one which is sufficient for many applications. Its accuracy is still high, with a maximum error of ±0.3°C from –55°C to +150°C. The TMP117 digitizes the temperature reading at a rate of 1 Hertz (Hz) and provides the results via I2C and SMBus™-compatible interfaces. Up to four of these ICs can be supported on a single bus. To reduce the processor burden, it includes a programmable threshold alert function. As many of its target applications are battery powered with limited energy capacity, it’s important to note that the TMP117 runs off a 1.8 to 5.5 volt supply, and typically draws 3.5 microamperes (µA) with a 150 nanoamperes (nA) shutdown current. It is also small, housed in a 6-lead, 2.00 mm by 2.00 mm WSON package. Ensuring sensor and system performance Choosing a sensor with the right specification and then using it appropriately are two related but somewhat independent issues. When choosing a temperature sensor, the basic question is always over what range it must provide valid readings. Once this is determined, there are questions related to required absolute accuracy, precision and resolution, and linearity over the entire range. Some applications are more concerned with “seeing” a small change in temperature rather than knowing its accurate value; for others, absolute accuracy of reading is more critical. The designer must carefully consider what level of performance is needed in each parameter. The situation is more complicated when higher accuracy is needed in a narrow zone of interest, while less is needed further away from that zone. Data sheets for temperature sensors come with a few broad claims such as “accuracy of ±1°C from –55°C to +150°C,” but also provide many detailed performance tables and graphs. These expand the high-level statement for users to provide context and indicate, for example, which specifications are typical numbers and which are minimum or maximum numbers. They will also show the linearity curve of the sensor, as its performance will differ in the various zones of its full range. Also, the reading’s precision is usually constant throughout the range while the absolute accuracy is not; this is usually not a concern where the system objective is primarily to report small changes around sensed values. Placement of the sensor is also an issue. It needs to be near the point or area of interest, of course, but the issue is exactly where and how near. In some cases, the sensor must be physically connected to the items being sensed (such as the frame of a motor which may overheat); in comparison, for an enclosure, it needs to be “somewhere” in the box. Even that “somewhere” can be challenging to determine, as being directly in the airflow may yield a reading which differs significantly from being near a hot component. For this reason, many advanced designs use multiple sensors to create a real-time thermal “map” of the system as it operates, measuring critical localized hot spots as well as the overall system temperature. This scenario does not just apply to small enclosures or chassis. IoT applications which need one or more temperature-sensed points include HVAC, water heaters, energy management, security, appliance monitoring, and other overheating scenarios. Differences between these readings, and especially changes in those differences, can indicate problems. There are two other favorable points about these solid state sensors for IoT applications. First, their small size and low mass means they have minimal thermal impact on the point or object being measured, and do not appreciably change the temperature rise/fall rate. Second, their low power dissipation means that their self-heating is also negligible, so the reading is not corrupted by the sensor’s own thermal emissions. Conclusion While traditional sensors have their advantages in specific applications, such as extremely high temperatures in the case of thermocouples, such extremes are rarely a concern for most IoT applications. This opens the door to solid state temperature sensors due to their fairly high accuracy and resolution, low power requirements, small size, and increasing levels of functionality. Both single and multichannel IoT applications can easily interface with these solid state devices, providing accurate and precise readings."

        "document": "Environmental monitoring is now critical for many organizations in many different industries. Food manufacturers, agricultural companies, construction firms, and real estate owners all have specific use cases. Because so many companies today maintain servers and other sensitive tech equipment, monitoring temperature and humidity is becoming more and more universal.\n\nBut there is a big difference between clunky, outdated gauges and modern, smart solutions that can be easily integrated into a comprehensive building management system. With features like cloud-based platforms, real-time tracking, remote access, and instant notifications, it is now easy to track temperature and humidity with complete control at scale no matter the application.\n\nHow are Temperature and Humidity Sensor Systems Used?\n\nThere are a wide range of climate-controlled environments that are sensitive to even relatively minor variations in temperature and humidity. This creates many applications for smart sensors capable of monitoring changes to help safeguard workers, equipment, product, and operations, including the following:\n• Protecting Critical Infrastructure and Technology: A temperature monitor that can constantly track indoor humidity level is essential for modern equipment, specifically tech equipment, in areas such as data centers, server rooms, and IDF closets.\n• Quality Control for Food Manufacturing: Food product quality, as well as various regulations, require very specific conditions that must be maintained to avoid spoilage, foodborne illness, shrinkage, and more issues.\n• Monitoring Construction Zones: In construction projects and infrastructure projects, concrete setting requires close monitoring to ensure that temperature and humidity don’t weaken the composition.\n• Reading Building Moisture Levels: Following the escape of water damage or flooding, building moisture levels must be monitored to ensure that it is safe to start restoration.\n• Preventing Mold Growth: To safeguard occupant health and identify root causes, it’s critical to monitor conditions in mold-prone dwellings.\n• Monitoring for Agriculture and Horticulture: Crop harvests, yields, and virtually every aspect of agriculture and horticulture require users to monitor and manage environments with a smart temperature sensor.\n• Managing Technical Equipment: Beyond the noted applications, climate control is vital to the protection and longevity of health service, data center, broadcast, pest control, as well as food and beverage dispensing equipment.\n\nFeatures to Look for in a Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System\n\nNot all temperature monitoring and humidity meter sensors and solutions are created equal. Some systems lack key capabilities, include platforms that are not user-friendly, and generally fail to deliver. To make sure you get the best option, look for the following features:\n• Remote Monitoring Capabilities: Modern companies are increasingly deploying smart sensors for a wide variety of monitoring applications. With so many options available, flexibility and control are essential. Remote monitoring is now a must-have capability to allow various personnel to access the system from anywhere across various sites on any device.\n• Cloud-Based Centralized Platform: Environmental monitoring alone can be useful, but it becomes truly powerful within a larger system. Through a cloud-based centralized platform, users can leverage full control and command over buildings and incorporate smart sensors into a wider system that includes security, surveillance, access control, and much more.\n• Adaptability and Scalability: No matter the application, most companies will want to alter and expand their monitoring capabilities over time. This makes it key to find an adaptable and scalable system that supports ease of configuration for small-scale or large-scale facilities as well as central monitoring of multiple remote sites.\n• Alerting System: A full-featured and modern temperature and humidity gauge needs real-time readings and proactive notifications. It isn’t enough to just log data. If a certain threshold is hit, authorized users need to be alerted instantly — through a central platform, app, email, text (SMS), or other communication method. A fully integrated system should allow the user to set an alarm schedule for different alert levels and timetables, for example, workdays, weekends, or holidays.\n• Security and Compliance: All modern systems must have advanced security to prevent exploits and comply with any necessary industry regulations, such as the data integrity and reliability standards of the FDA’s Code of Federal Regulations for Food and Drugs. This generally requires well-protected audit trails/logs and multiple user levels with clearly defined authorization and access privileges.\n• Maintenance and Support: Because monitoring systems are crucial to maintaining compliance with industry regulations, any system failures have to be resolved as quickly as possible. Whether the system is hosted or SaaS, it is imperative to procure an around-the-clock technical support plan within any contract package.\n• Automated Continuous Monitoring: Any monitoring system should preferably be automated and continuous with no need for human intervention. Installing a real-time, or nearly real-time, data recording system — along with a cost-effective and efficient monitoring platform — offers a clear advantage in all but the smallest facilities.\n• User Management: Ease of use should be a priority and this extends to user management. It should be simple to add new users and grant various access privileges across different user levels and send out notifications to specific individuals.\n\nWhat are the Three Main Ways to Measure Humidity?\n\nThere are three main aspects to consider when it comes to measuring humidity levels through a sensor system:\n• Absolute Humidity (AH): The amount of water vapor in the air.\n• Relative Humidity (RH): The absolute humidity measured as a percentage of the maximum possible humidity at the current temperature. (Hotter air is capable of holding much more moisture.)\n• Specific Humidity: The ratio of water vapor mass to the total mass of a given amount of air.\n\nRegardless of the use case, Relative Humidity (RH) and temperature almost always go hand in hand because, without knowing the temperature, RH is effectively meaningless. For a given amount of moisture in the same amount of air, the RH value will fall as temperature increases (because hot air is capable of holder more water). The changing nature of RH along with temperature is one of the many reasons why it is important for a system to monitor and graphically display the RH and temperature over time — and not just record a static, isolated data point.\n\nFinding the Best Temperature and Humidity Monitoring Solution\n\nAs technology has advanced and companies increasingly maintain their own critical equipment, the need for temperature and humidity monitoring has only grown. These days, it just makes sense for more and more organizations to include alongside their other smart building management control system.\n\nMeanwhile, firms in more specialized industries with essential use cases are recognizing the value of upgrading to a better platform. Rather than having something that can simply get the job done, they are looking for a real solution.\n\nNo matter your need, there is a great option out there. The key is finding something that will work long-term as you grow and scale with all the features you need."
