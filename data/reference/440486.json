        "document": "This reference guide is the first in a four-part series about designing, building, and deploying microservices. This series describes the various elements of a microservices architecture. The series includes information about the benefits and drawbacks of the microservices architecture pattern, and how to apply it.\n\nThis series is intended for application developers and architects who design and implement the migration to refactor a monolith application to a microservices application.\n\nA monolithic application is a single-tiered software application in which different modules are combined into a single program. For example, if you're building an ecommerce application, the application is expected to have a modular architecture that is aligned with object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. The following diagram shows an example ecommerce application setup, in which the application consists of various modules. In a monolithic application, modules are defined using a combination of programming language constructs (such as Java packages) and build artifacts (such as Java JAR files).\n\nFigure 1. Diagram of a monolithic ecommerce application with several modules using a combination of programming language constructs.\n\nIn figure 1, different modules in the ecommerce application correspond to business logic for payment, delivery, and order management. All of these modules are packaged and deployed as a single logical executable. The actual format depends on the application's language and framework. For example, many Java applications are packaged as JAR files and deployed on application servers such as Tomcat or Jetty. Similarly, a Rails or Node.js application is packaged as a directory hierarchy.\n\nMonolithic architecture is a conventional solution for building applications. The following are some advantages of adopting a monolithic design for your application:\n• You can implement end-to-end testing of a monolithic application by using tools like Selenium.\n• To deploy a monolithic application, you can simply copy the packaged application to a server.\n• All modules in a monolithic application share memory, space, and resources, so you can use a single solution to address cross-cutting concerns such as logging, caching, and security.\n• The monolithic approach can provide performance advantages, because modules can call each other directly. By contrast, microservices typically require a network call to communicate with each other.\n\nComplex monoliths often become progressively harder to build, debug, and reason about. At some point, the problems outweigh the benefits.\n• Applications typically grow over time. It can become complicated to implement changes in a large and complex application that has tightly coupled modules. Because any code change affects the whole system, you have to thoroughly coordinate changes. Coordinating changes makes the overall development and testing process much longer compared to microservice applications.\n• It can be complicated to achieve continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) with a large monolith. This complexity is because you must redeploy the entire application in order to update any one part of it. Also, it's likely that you have to do extensive manual testing of the entire application to check for regressions.\n• Monolithic applications can be difficult to scale when different modules have conflicting resource requirements. For example, one module might implement CPU-intensive image-processing logic. Another module might be an in-memory database. Because these modules are deployed together, you have to compromise on the choice of hardware.\n• Because all modules run within the same process, a bug in any module, such as a memory leak, can potentially bring down the entire system.\n• Monolithic applications add complexity when you want to adopt new frameworks and languages. For example, it is expensive (in both time and money) to rewrite an entire application to use a new framework, even if that framework is considerably better.\n\nA microservice typically implements a set of distinct features or functionality. Each microservice is a mini-application that has its own architecture and business logic. For example, some microservices expose an API that's consumed by other microservices or by the application's clients, such as third-party integrations with payment gateways and logistics.\n\nFigure 1 showed a monolithic ecommerce application with several modules. The following diagram shows a possible decomposition of the ecommerce application into microservices:\n\nFigure 2. Diagram of an ecommerce application with functional areas implemented by microservices.\n\nIn figure 2, a dedicated microserve implements each functional area of the ecommerce application. Each backend service might expose an API, and services consume APIs provided by other services. For example, to render web pages, the UI services invoke the checkout service and other services. Services might also use asynchronous, message-based communication. For more information about how services communicate with each other, see the third document in this series, Interservice communication in a microservices setup.\n\nThe microservices architecture pattern significantly changes the relationship between the application and the database. Instead of sharing a single database with other services, we recommend that each service have its own database that best fits its requirements. When you have one database for each service, you ensure loose coupling between services because all requests for data go through the service API and not through the shared database directly. The following diagram shows a microservices architecture pattern in which each service has its own database:\n\nFigure 3. Each service in a microservice architecture has its own database.\n\nIn figure 3, the order service in the ecommerce application functions well using a document-oriented database that has real-time search capabilities. The payment and delivery services rely on the strong atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability (ACID) guarantees of a relational database.\n\nThe microservices architecture pattern addresses the problem of complexity described in the preceding Monolith challenges section. A microservices architecture provides the following benefits:\n• Although the total functionality is unchanged, you use microservices to separate the application into manageable chunks or services. Each service has a well-defined boundary in the form of an RPC or message-driven API. Therefore, individual services can be faster to develop, and easier to understand and maintain.\n• Autonomous teams can independently develop individual services. You can organize microservices around business boundaries, not the technical capabilities of a product. You organize your teams for a single, independent responsibility for the entire lifecycle of their assigned piece of software from development to testing to deployment to maintenance and monitoring.\n• Independent microservice development process also lets your developers write each microservice in a different programming language, creating a polyglot application. When you use the most effective language for each microservice, you can develop an application more quickly and optimize your application to reduce code complexity and to increase performance and functionality.\n• When you decouple capabilities out of a monolith, you can have the independent teams release their microservice independently. Independent release cycles can help improve your teams' velocity and product time to market.\n• Microservices architecture also lets you scale each service independently. You can deploy the number of instances of each service that satisfy its capacity and availability constraints. You can also use the hardware that best matches a service's resource requirements. When you scale services independently, you help increase the availability and the reliability of the entire system.\n\nThe following are some specific instances in which it can be beneficial to migrate from a monolith to a microservice architecture:\n• Implementing improvements in scalability, manageability, agility, or speed of delivery.\n• Incrementally rewriting a large legacy application to a modern language and technology stack to meet new business demands.\n• Extracting cross-cutting business applications or cross-cutting services so that you can reuse them across multiple channels. Examples of services you might want to reuse include payment services, login services, encryption services, flight search services, customer profile services, and notification services.\n• Adopting a purpose-built language or framework for a specific functionality of an existing monolith.\n\nMicroservices have some challenges when compared to monoliths, including the following:\n• A major challenge of microservices is the complexity that's caused because the application is a distributed system. Developers need to choose and implement an inter-services communication mechanism. The services must also handle partial failures and unavailability of upstream services.\n• None Another challenge with microservices is that you need to manage transactions across different microservices (also referred to as a distributed transaction). Business operations that update multiple business entities are fairly common, and they are usually applied in an atomic manner in which either all operations are applied or everything fails. When you wrap multiple operations in a single database transaction, you ensure atomicity. In a microservices-based application, business operations might be spread across different microservices, so you need to update multiple databases that different services own. If there is a failure, it's non-trivial to track the failure or success of calls to the different microservices and roll back state. The worst case scenario can result in inconsistent data between services when the rollback of state due to failures didn't happen correctly. For information about the various methodologies to set up distributed transactions between services, see the third document in this series, Interservice communication in a microservices setup.\n• None Comprehensive testing of microservices-based applications is more complex than testing a monolithic application. For example, to test the functionality of processing an order in a monolithic ecommerce service, you select items, add them to a cart, and then check out. To test the same flow in a microservices-based architecture, multiple services - such as frontend, order, and payment - call each other to complete the test run.\n• None Deploying a microservices-based application is more complex than deploying a monolithic application. A microservice application typically consists of many services, each of which has multiple runtime instances. You also need to implement a service discovery mechanism that enables a service to discover the locations of any other services it needs to communicate with.\n• None A microservices architecture adds operations overhead because there are more services to monitor and alert on. Microservice architecture also has more points of failure due to the increased points of service-to-service communication. A monolithic application might be deployed to a small application server cluster. A microservices-based application might have tens of separate services to build, test, deploy and run, potentially in multiple languages and environments. All of these services need to be clustered for failover and resilience. Productionizing a microservices application requires high-quality monitoring and operations infrastructure.\n• None The division of services in a microservice architecture allows the application to perform more functions at the same time. However, because the modules run as isolated services, latency is introduced in the response time due to network calls between services.\n• None Not all applications are large enough to break down into microservices. Also, some applications require tight integration between components—for example, applications that must process rapid streams of real-time data. Any added layers of communication between services may slow real-time processing down. Thinking about the communication between services beforehand can provide helpful insights in clearly marking the service boundaries.\n\nWhen deciding whether microservice architecture is best for your application, consider the following points:\n• Microservice best practices require per-service databases. When you do data modeling for your application, notice whether per-service databases fit your application.\n• When you implement a microservice architecture, you must instrument and monitor the environment so that you can identify bottlenecks, detect and prevent failures, and support diagnostics.\n• In a microservice architecture, each service has separate access controls. To help ensure security, you need to secure access to each service both within the environment and from external applications that consume its APIs.\n• Synchronous interservice communication typically reduces the availability of an application. For example, if the order service in an ecommerce application synchronously invokes other services upstream, and if those services are unavailable, it can't create an order. Therefore, we recommend that you implement asynchronous, message-based communication.\n\nWhen to migrate a monolithic application to microservices\n\nIf you're already successfully running a monolith, adopting microservices is a significant investment cost for your team. Different teams implement the principles of microservices in different ways. Each engineering team has unique outcomes for how small their microservices are, or how many microservices they need.\n\nTo determine if microservices are the best approach for your application, first identify the key business goals or pain points you want to address. There might be simpler ways to achieve your goals or address the issues that you identify. For example, if you want to scale your application up faster, you might find that autoscaling is a more efficient solution. If you're finding bugs in production, you can start by implementing unit tests and continuous integration (CI).\n\nIf you believe that a microservice approach is the best way to achieve your goals, start by extracting one service from the monolith and develop, test, and deploy it in production. For more information, see the next document in this series, Refactor a monolith into microservices. After you have successfully extracted one service and have it running in production, start extraction of the next service and continue learning from each cycle.\n\nThe microservice architecture pattern decomposes a system into a set of independently deployable services. When you develop a monolithic application, you have to coordinate large teams, which can cause slow software development. When you implement a microservices architecture, you enable small, autonomous teams to work in parallel, which can accelerate your development.\n\nIn the next document in this series, Refactor a monolith into microservices, you learn about various strategies for refactoring a monolithic application into microservices.\n• Read the next document in this series to learn about application refactoring strategies to decompose microservices.\n• Read the third document in this series to learn about interservice communication in a microservices setup.\n• Read the fourth, final document in this series to learn about distributed tracing of requests between microservices."

        "document": "Many major online retailers use e-commerce architectures built with all-in-one platforms such as Shopify, Magento, and Salesforce Commerce Cloud to launch e-commerce websites. These platforms, also called monolithic platforms, combine business services like product information management, order management, pricing, and other e-commerce functionality into a rigid system to simplify site deployment and management. However, in doing so, they sacrifice the flexibility and scalability required to meet the demands of a growing business.\n\nA more scalable e-commerce architecture is achievable by using distinct commerce services that are called microservices-based or service-oriented architectures (SOAs). These services are isolated e-commerce applications that handle unique e-commerce business functions and communicate with each other using APIs.\n\nWith this type of e-commerce architecture, businesses can upscale, downscale, and replace individual functions without breaking the entire e-commerce architecture. They can also introduce a headless CMS to use their website architecture to power other channels of commerce such as mobile apps, points of sale, and social media platforms. This practice is called headless commerce and, paired with SOA, is the best way to scale commerce. After all, this is how Amazon scaled commerce.\n\nWith traditional, monolithic e-commerce architectures, it’s impossible to modify individual e-commerce functions without compromising the entire system. Something as simple as upscaling infrastructure for a product launch or holiday weekend can require months of preparation.\n\nWith modern, service-oriented e-commerce architectures, brands don’t need months to prepare for an event that only lasts a few days. They can also update, upscale, or enhance individual services within their tech stack without jeopardizing the entire system.\n\nDiagram (left): In a traditional e-commerce architecture, a monolithic platform is used to power one sales channel or head. Introducing another channel often means using another platform, leading to disconnected data, technical debt, and higher e-commerce software costs.\n\nDiagram (right): In a modern e-commerce architecture, a “headless” commerce API is used as a data communication layer to power multiple sales channels or heads. Services like the product information manager (PIM) and order management system (OMS) are separate, scalable services and connected through APIs. The headless CMS functions as another scalable service that provides the content to infinite channels.\n\nWhile some monolithic commerce platforms offer the ability to decouple the frontend from the backend and make the system headless, the backend remains unscalable. In the rest of this article, I’ll walk you through the high-level steps needed to create a scalable e-commerce website architecture using microservices rather than a traditional monolith.\n\n\n\nBefore designing a microservices e-commerce architecture, it’s essential to review existing architecture to identify existing software and challenges. This will help you map priorities, determine technical capabilities, and effectively plan for the new architecture.\n\nLet’s take a look at an unscalable, traditional architecture that many high-growth brands use in niche verticals. First, we’ll review the software, then we’ll highlight some challenges with the software and the e-commerce architecture. Use the same approach during your review, complete with a high-level diagram like the one below.\n\nThe software this brand uses includes:\n• Magento website: The brand uses this platform to power its main e-commerce site. It chose Magento because it’s free and relatively easy to use. However, more and more Magento extensions are used over time.\n• Shopify side site: The brand launched a daily deals site on Shopify since connecting another sales channel to Magento was not intuitive. However, this led to inventory and fulfillment issues.\n• Square in-store POS: This is the first technology the brand purchased when it launched its in-store business. Magento and Shopify were added later on.\n• Overselling occurs because Shopify, Magento, and the POS do not communicate with one order management system (OMS).\n• Productivity declines because offline conversations, paperwork, and patchy Magento extensions are required to make the system work.\n• The brand needs additional resources for data entry since connecting channels require manual data entry in spreadsheets or Quickbooks.\n• Magento extensions and Shopify apps cause single points of failure; installing, uninstalling, or updating them can bring down the entire system.\n\nClearly defining your existing architecture, software, and challenges like this is imperative for setting up a new approach to a service-oriented e-commerce architecture that’s more scalable.\n\n\n\nOnce you understand your existing architecture and business needs, it’s time to choose an approach to replace it that does not require an expensive and risky replatforming project. The primary choice at this stage is between building or buying commerce microservices, applications, and APIs.\n\nBest practice is to build microservices for differentiating features that are specific to your unique business and buy microservices for necessary features from software providers like fabric. An example of a differentiating feature is a room builder for a home decor e-commerce company. Examples of necessary features include catalog management, cart, pricing, and checkout.\n\nBuilding a complete microservices architecture for e-commerce in-house is only viable for an enterprise with complex needs. A custom solution can be more expensive to build and maintain. So, unless you’re a billion-dollar enterprise like Amazon, it’ll probably end up being more trouble than it’s worth.\n\nHowever, there are some microservices you will want to build in-house. One popular way for building custom e-commerce applications is with Amazon elastic container services (ECS). This is a service that lets you quickly launch, exit, or manage docker containers on a cluster. Amazon ECS maintains the application’s availability, allowing users to scale containers when necessary.\n\nDevelopers at e-commerce brands can also build their own system using Docker. Docker packages individual applications into Docker containers and uses tools such as Kubernetes and Portainer to manage and scale containerized applications (i.e. microservices). Further, you can use tools such as Kong or Ocelot to act as API gateway and help backend microservices communicate with frontend client devices.\n\nAs you can see, there are many tools required to build e-commerce microservices in-house. Besides creating and managing service containers, developers and operation teams need to configure applications to handle load balancing, service discovery, logging, monitoring, and tracing. That’s a lot of overhead. If the company isn’t careful, it can have many distributed monoliths in its e-commerce architecture.\n\nAnother way to build a scalable e-commerce architecture is by using commerce services and APIs from third-party providers. This approach can help brands architect a microservices-based infrastructure while simplifying service management. Below is a simple e-commerce infrastructure diagram that demonstrates a microservices-based architecture using a service provider like fabric.\n\nBackend: There are a robust set of apps that includes a PIM, OMS, and pricing engine that come with a user interface for business users. These modular, independent applications are equipped with APIs to provide as much flexibility as custom applications.\n\nAPI: To orchestrate data and events between the frontend and backend, brands must have an API middle layer. This layer allows them to move away from monolithic architectures by “microservicing” elements of their tech stack one at a time instead of all together.\n\nFrontend: The frontend is managed by a headless CMS that supports multiple frameworks like Angular, React, and Vue to build reusable components. It lets you control the entire frontend shopping experience by integrating commerce services via APIs.\n\nThird-party providers give the flexibility needed to design a future-proof e-commerce architecture. It lets retailers add, remove, and modify individual microservices within their architecture without risking the entire system and building the microservices themselves.\n\n\n\nAfter finalizing the new architecture, it’s time to move away from the old, legacy commerce platform. While there are many modern-day design patterns, it’s best to use the strangler pattern to migrate to a modern, service-oriented platform. This approach helps you move away from a monolith by replacing one component at a time. It minimizes the risk of project failure during migration and distributes the development effort needed.\n\nLegacy platforms such as Magento, Shopify, and Oracle ATG let you separate the frontend and e-commerce backend with APIs. E-commerce businesses can leverage this and use API calls to pull data onto a modern frontend like fabric XM or replace individual backend commerce components with microservices such as Stripe for payments, Algolia for search, and fabric PIM for inventory.\n\nLet’s assume a brand wants to start with migrating the catalog in its monolithic e-commerce platform to a modular, service-oriented PIM. The first step is to export all product data in a format that’s compatible with the new microservices-based system. Then you need to parse and import it into the new database. The actual process will vary based on the choice of service and database. However, here’s a sample Node script that uses the XmlStream library:\n\nIt’s worth pointing out that things can still go wrong despite the best efforts. Even the slightest error during migration can result in failure. However, this is fixable by using a managed message queueing service such as Amazon SQS that lets you configure retry policies to handle common errors.\n\nFailure causes are often highly variable, and there’s no set way to overcome them. So make sure you reference Amazon’s documentation to configure message queues for your system and use case.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Rally Support Around the New Architecture\n\nEngineers and developers can craft solid implementation ideas and migration strategies to deploy a microservice architecture. However, they’ll likely need the entire organization’s support, including C-level executives and board of directors at some level during the project.\n\nA recent MIT Sloan Management report reveals that every successful digital transformation demands that leaders transform themselves digitally first. Adopting a new e-commerce architecture is unlikely to be effective without leadership embracing and championing the modern, scalable e-commerce approach. Key stakeholders and business executives must be ready for the changes and long-term commitment of this new, modern architecture.\n\nAlso, the development team must believe enough in the idea to “light up” the rest of the organization. Because adopting a microservice architecture requires more deployable units, it takes more effort to implement. So it’s much harder to scale without the whole team on board. The engineering team should show key departments why a microservices system is far more scalable and easier to customize, as well as the preparations and the commitment needed to implement it effectively.\n\nFollowing this step and other steps outlined above will position your company for long-term success without bringing ongoing activities across merchandising, marketing, and development to a standstill."

        "document": "You are developing a business-critical enterprise application. You need to deliver changes rapidly, frequently and reliably - as measured by the DORA metrics - in order for your business to thrive in today’s volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world. Consequently, your engineering organization is organized into small, loosely coupled, cross-functional teams as described by Team Topologies. Each team delivers software using DevOps practices as defined by the DevOps handbook. In particular, it practices continuous deployment. The team delivers a stream of small, frequent changes that are tested by an automated deployment pipeline and deployed into production.\n\nA team is responsible for one or more subdomains. A subdomain is an implementable model of a slice of business functionality, a.k.a. business capability. It consists of business logic, which consists of business entities (a.k.a. DDD aggregates) that implement business rules, and adapters, which communicate with the outside world. A Java-based subdomain, for example, consists of classes organized into packages that’s compiled into a JAR file.\n\nThe subdomains implement the application’s behavior, which consists of a set of (system) operations. An operation is invoked in one of three ways: synchronous and asynchronous requests from clients; events published by other applications and services; and the passing of time. It mutates and queries business entities in one or more subdomains.\n\nHow to organize the subdomains into one or more deployable/executable components?\n\nThere are five dark energy forces:\n• Simple components - simple components consisting of few subdomains are easier to understand and maintain than complex components\n• Team autonomy - a team needs to be able to develop, test and deploy their software independently of other teams\n• Fast deployment pipeline - fast feedback and high deployment frequency are essential and are enabled by a fast deployment pipeline, which in turn requires components that are fast to build and test.\n• Support multiple technology stacks - subdomains are sometimes implemented using a variety of technologies; and developers need to evolve the application’s technology stack, e.g. use current versions of languages and frameworks\n• Segregate by characteristics - e.g. resource requirements to improve scalability, their availability requirements to improve availability, their security requirements to improve security, etc.\n\nThere are five dark matter forces:\n• Simple interactions - an operation that’s local to a component or consists of a few simple interactions between components is easier to understand and troubleshoot than a distributed operation, especially one consisting of complex interactions\n• Efficient interactions - a distributed operation that involves lots of network round trips and large data transfers can be too inefficient\n• Prefer ACID over BASE - it’s easier to implement an operation as an ACID transaction rather than, for example, eventually consistent sagas\n• Minimize runtime coupling - to maximize the availability and reduce the latency of an operation\n• Minimize design time coupling - reduce the likelihood of changing services in lockstep, which reduces productivity\n\nDesign an architecture that structures the application as a set of two or more independently deployable, loosely coupled, components, a.k.a. services. Each service consists of one or more subdomains. Each subdomain is part of a single service except for shared library subdomains that are used by multiple services. A service is owned by the team (or teams) that owns the (non-library) subdomains.\n\nAn API gateway is typically the application’s entry point. Some system operations will be local to a single service, while others will be distributed across multiple services. A distributed system operation is implemented using the service collaboration patterns.\n\nIn order to be independently deployable each service typically has its own source code repository and its own deployment pipeline, which builds, tests and deploys the service.\n\nLet’s imagine that you are building an e-commerce application that takes orders from customers, verifies inventory and available credit, and ships them. The application consists of several components including the StoreFrontUI, which implements the user interface, along with some backend services for checking credit, maintaining inventory and shipping orders. The application consists of a set of services.\n\nPlease see the example applications developed by Chris Richardson. These examples on Github illustrate various aspects of the microservice architecture.\n\nThis solution has a number of benefits:\n• Simple services - each service consists of a small number of subdomains - possibly just one - and so is easier to understand and maintain\n• Team autonomy - a team can develop, test and deploy their service independently of other teams\n• Fast deployment pipeline - each service is fast to test since it’s relatively small, and can be deployed independently\n• Support multiple technology stacks - different services can use different technology stacks and can be upgraded independently\n• Segregate subdomains by their characteristics - subdomains can be segregated by their characteristics into separate services in order to improve scalability, availability, security etc\n\nThis solution has a number of (potential) drawbacks:\n• Some distributed operations might be complex, and difficult to understand and troubleshoot\n• Some distributed operations might be potentially inefficient\n• Some operations might need to be implemented using complex, eventually consistent (non-ACID) transaction management since loose coupling requires each service to have its own database.\n• Some distributed operations might involve tight runtime coupling between services, which reduces their availability.\n• Risk of tight design-time coupling between services, which requires time consuming lockstep changes\n\nThere are many issues that you must address when designing an architecture.\n\nThere are two key issues that you must address. The first issue is whether to use the monolithic or microservice architecture. And then, if you choose to use the microservice architecture, the next key challenge is to define a good service architecture. You must avoid (or at least minimize) the potential drawbacks: complex, inefficient interactions; complex eventually consistent transactions; and tight runtime coupling.\n\nAssemblage, is an architecture definition process that uses the dark energy and dark matter forces to group the subdomains in a way that results in good microservice architecture.\n\nThe result of applying Assemblage is either a monolithic architecture or a microservice architecture.\n\nThe dark energy and dark matter forces play a major role in shaping the service architecture and also heavily influence the design of the distributed operations mentioned below.\n\nAnother key design challenge when using microservices, is implementing distributed operations, which span multiple services. This is especially challenging since each service has its own database. The solution is to use the service collaboration patterns, which implement distributed operations as a series of local transactions:\n\nThere are four service collaboration patterns:\n• Saga, which implements a distributed command as a series of local transactions\n• Command-side replica, which replicas read-only data to the service that implements a command\n• API composition, which implements a distributed query as a series of local queries\n• CQRS, which implements a distributed query as a series of local queries\n\nThe Saga, Command-side replica and CQRS patterns use asynchronous messaging. Services typically need to use the Transaction Outbox pattern to atomically update persistent business entities and send a message.\n\nThere are many patterns related to the Microservices architecture pattern. The Monolithic architecture is an alternative to the microservice architecture. The other patterns in the Microservice architecture architecture pattern address issues that you will encounter when applying this pattern.\n• Sservice collaboration patterns:\n• Saga, which implements a distributed command as a series of local transactions\n• Command-side replica, which replicas read-only data to the service that implements a command\n• API composition, which implements a distributed query as a series of local queries\n• CQRS, which implements a distributed query as a series of local queries\n• The Messaging and Remote Procedure Invocation patterns are two different ways that services can communicate.\n• The Database per Service pattern describes how each service has its own database in order to ensure loose coupling.\n• The API Gateway pattern defines how clients access the services in a microservice architecture.\n• The Client-side Discovery and Server-side Discovery patterns are used to route requests for a client to an available service instance in a microservice architecture.\n• The Single Service per Host and Multiple Services per Host patterns are two different deployment strategies.\n\nMost large scale web sites including Netflix, Amazon and eBay have evolved from a monolithic architecture to a microservice architecture.\n\nNetflix, which is a very popular video streaming service that’s responsible for up to 30% of Internet traffic, has a large scale, service-oriented architecture. They handle over a billion calls per day to their video streaming API from over 800 different kinds of devices. Each API call fans out to an average of six calls to backend services.\n\nAmazon.com originally had a two-tier architecture. In order to scale they migrated to a service-oriented architecture consisting of hundreds of backend services. Several applications call these services including the applications that implement the Amazon.com website and the web service API. The Amazon.com website application calls 100-150 services to get the data that used to build a web page.\n\nThe auction site ebay.com also evolved from a monolithic architecture to a service-oriented architecture. The application tier consists of multiple independent applications. Each application implements the business logic for a specific function area such as buying or selling. Each application uses X-axis splits and some applications such as search use Z-axis splits. Ebay.com also applies a combination of X-, Y- and Z-style scaling to the database tier.\n\nThere are numerous other examples of companies using the microservice architecture.\n• Jfokus 2020 - Cubes, Hexagons, Triangles, and More - Understanding Microservices - provides a good introduction to the microservice architecture."

        "document": "Microservices-based architecture is a software architecture pattern that provides a way to build your software system as a collection of small services that each have a specific responsibility. The idea is to split your functionality into discrete, independently deployable units such that each unit can be scaled independently and developed by different teams. Microservices-based architecture exists in contrast to a monolithic architecture, where your software system is implemented and deployed as a single unit.\n\nIn a microservices-based architecture, each microservice usually has its own database (though there are specific circumstances that may cause one or more microservices to share a single database). Microservices define their own Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), and communicate with one another via APIs or asynchronous messaging. Communication via APIs requires a common language such as SOAP, REST, or gRPC. Communication via asynchronous messaging requires a message queue or log such as Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ.\n\nIn this article, you'll learn more about what microservices-based architecture is and how it can help you build scalable e-commerce systems.\n\nMicroservices-based architecture offers several benefits to software development teams building e-commerce systems. Let’s take a look at a few.\n\nAn e-commerce software system typically consists of several components including inventory, shopping cart, checkout, payment gateway, blog, and so on. Multiple software development teams may need to contribute simultaneously to the development of these components. In a monolithic architecture, there is a higher likelihood of tight coupling among components, which makes it more difficult for multiple software development teams to make concurrent changes to the system. In a microservices-based architecture, the components that make up an e-commerce system can be implemented as separate microservices. Each software development team can work on each service at the same time with little to no impact on other services.\n\nMicroservices also offer improved fault isolation. Since microservices-based architecture enables you to implement subsets of e-commerce functionality as separate microservices, a fault in one microservice is less likely to cause the entire e-commerce system to stop functioning. For example, a fault in your blog service will not affect other aspects of your system, such as inventory or checkout.\n\nA microservices-based architecture enables you to scale individual parts of your system based on the unique requirements of each part without needing to allocate more resources to the entire system. Given the varied functionality present in most e-commerce systems, it is possible for each microservice to have different scalability requirements. For example, if you publish an article on your e-commerce blog that becomes popular and leads to a surge in traffic, you will be able to scale the specific service that handles your blog without having to scale your entire system. Generally, if one microservice in your e-commerce system becomes too slow or busy, you can simply add more instances of the specific service depending on how much traffic it's getting.\n\nSimilarly, a properly designed microservices-based architecture enables you to independently deploy changes that occur in one microservice without having to deploy other microservices. Independent deployability allows you to steadily deliver new features or fix problems in a particular service without needing to redeploy your entire e-commerce system or extensively coordinate deployment across multiple software development teams.\n\nMonolithic architectures are typically implemented with a single technology stack (programming language, database, etc.), regardless of whether the technology stack is the best tool for each part of the system. In contrast, a microservices-based architecture allows you to build each microservice in your e-commerce system with a technology stack that is best-suited for the functionality it provides. You can also change the technology stack used to implement a particular microservice without breaking or affecting other microservices.\n\nImagine that you are building an e-commerce system to display product details, manage inventory, take orders from customers, and publish a blog for e-commerce-related content. The following diagram illustrates a microservices-based architecture for the e-commerce system:\n\nThe architecture consists of a user interface (web and mobile application), routing layer (API gateway, load balancer, service registry, and message broker), several services that provide specific e-commerce functionality, and databases for data storage and retrieval. It also includes a third-party content management API that is used to manage a blog. In the following sections, you'll discover the role that each component plays in this architecture.\n\nThe user interface provides a way for end users (e.g., customers, inventory managers, or external partners) to interact with the system and carry out specific operations (e.g., search for an item, add an item to the shopping cart, or add an item to the inventory).\n\nFor e-commerce systems, it is typical to provide a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that is usable on both desktop and mobile devices. You can build these UIs using client-side web development frameworks such as React, Angular, or Vue.js. You can also build them with native Android or iOS development tools to provide an effective way for end users to access your e-commerce services on their mobile devices.\n\nWhen users perform tasks via the user interface, the UI sends requests to the routing layer. The routing layer is then responsible for sending requests received from the UI (or from some other microservice) to one or more target microservices. A typical routing layer includes an API gateway, load balancer, service registry, and message broker.\n\nSince each microservice in the e-commerce system provides its own API and there are typically multiple microservices, the web and mobile UIs may need to send multiple requests to different microservices to retrieve inventory and product information. The API gateway reduces the need to make multiple requests to different microservices by serving as a single entry point for requests. It may simply forward requests to the appropriate microservice or fan out a single request to multiple services. It also serves as a layer of indirection that enables you to make changes to the structure or functionality boundaries of your microservices with minimal impact to the functionality of the UI.\n\nYou can implement a scalable API gateway with a variety of different technologies including Netty, Node.js, and Nginx.\n\nThe API gateway works together with a load balancer to distribute and balance requests among several instances of a microservice to ensure that no single instance is overwhelmed by the requests. In many microservices-based systems, especially those deployed in the cloud, the locations and number of instances of each service changes dynamically. Your API gateway and load balancer need to know the location (IP address and port) of each microservice they communicate with. Each microservice also needs to know the location of other microservices so that it can communicate with them. You can use a service registry to keep track of the information required to locate each microservice in your e-commerce system. Any communication with a microservice requires you to first query the service registry to locate the microservice so that the request can be sent to the appropriate location. This process is typically called service discovery.\n\nMicroservices often need to communicate with one another to carry out specific tasks. In some scenarios, one microservice can call another using the APIs provided by the target microservice. However, communication between microservices via the APIs they provide is synchronous—that is, the sender of a request has to wait until it receives a response from the microservice before it can do anything else.\n\nMessage brokers offer an alternative to synchronous communication such that a request to a microservice and the subsequent response can occur independently from each other. For example, in your e-commerce system, when a customer completes an order, you could send a request asynchronously via a message broker to update product availability in the inventory service without having the customer wait for completion of the product availability update. Asynchronous communication allows your customers to interact with other parts of your e-commerce system (e.g. browse inventory, complete another order, etc.) while operations occur in the background.\n\nYou can implement asynchronous messaging with several different technologies including Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ.\n\nEach microservice is responsible for a distinct portion of functionality in the e-commerce system. For example, the Inventory service is responsible for managing product availability; the Shopping Cart service is responsible for tracking each user's shopping cart; the Checkout service is responsible for placing orders based on items in the shopping cart; and the Blog service is responsible for managing content for blog posts. Some other common examples of microservices in an e-commerce system include a Customers service to manage customer information, a Products service to manage product details, a Tax service to determine taxes to be applied to products, and a Payments service to manage payments.\n\nYou can implement each microservice with whatever technology stack works best for the required functionality. For example, you could choose to use a third-party tool like Hygraph to manage content in your blog service instead of building a blog from scratch. In fact, Hygraph can help you manage several different forms of content across your e-commerce system such as privacy policies, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), product details, and even arbitrary content from remote sources that connect to REST or GraphQL APIs. You can also implement microservices with a variety of server-side web development frameworks such as Flask, Express, and Spring Boot.\n\nFinally, an e-commerce system needs to store and retrieve data about products, shipment information, payment details, and any other pieces of data necessary to operate an online store. The data required to carry out e-commerce operations is typically stored in one or more databases. Storing disparate forms of data may require a single type of database or different types of databases. For example, the Inventory service may require a document-oriented database like Elasticsearch so that users can efficiently search for specific products, while the Shipping service may require only a traditional relational database like PostgreSQL. If you choose to adopt the database-per-service pattern, then you will be able to use a data store that is optimized for the specific needs of each microservice, even if that means using different types of databases across your e-commerce system.\n\nIn this article, you've learned what microservices-based architecture is and why it is useful for e-commerce systems. When applied carefully, microservices-based architecture will help you manage scale and complexity in your system. It enables you to make technology choices that are best suited for the specific functionalities your system provides.\n\nFor your content management needs, Hygraph provides content management APIs that fit seamlessly into your microservices-based architecture to create, enrich, unify, and deliver your e-commerce content across multiple platforms.

        "document": "Vending machines have been around for a very long time, and people are using them a lot. You may have used a vending Machine at the airport or any public place before. You enter the required amount for the products, select the button and boom, you get your product.\n\nThese were the traditional vending machines and have become a thing of the past as the world is advancing towards cashless transactions and using cash less and less for purchases.\n\nIn contrast to traditional vending machines, those fitted with card readers are leading in automating the world of retail with the ultimate convenience availed, hence posting huge sales for businesses.\n\nAlso, it has been discovered that vending machines fitted with card readers realize 30-50% more sales than those operated by cash only.\n\nWe at Linkitsoft are a pioneer company in vending software and app development since we stand out in the integration of card readers in vending machines. We develop vending apps with card reader facilities to machines that are not just a convenience but a leap into the future of automated retail.\n\nIn this detailed guide, we will explore the essence of vending machines with card readers and explain every step enriched by our experiences and what should you do to increase your business leads and customer reputation journey.\n\nWhat are Vending Machines with Card Readers?\n\nSo, if you are unfamiliar with vending machines, think of them as a large box with shelves inside; on each shelf, there is a row of products—bottles of soda or packets of potato chips.\n\nIt recognizes this since you insert the money in either coins or bills. You then press the button for whatever it is you want to buy. In the machine, a coil or a small arm pushes the item forward until it falls into the slot where you are standing to grab it. Everything says really how much of a basic process it is—in goes your money, you make a selection, and there is the item handed over to you.\n\nEarlier vending machines worked as if they were a self-serve store. You could only use coins or cash. With a card reader today, it is like the store also accepts credit cards.\n\nIt’s like adding another way for you to pay for your stuff, like when shops began taking credit cards instead of cash. You swipe or tap your card on the reader, and it contacts your bank to verify if you have enough money.\n\nAssuming that it is okay, this machine works just the same as before—it operates after you’ve made your choice and then dispenses what you’ve chosen. It is like using a card at a shop instead of cash.\n\nReally, in essence, that is the difference: how you pay. You still end up with the same snack or drink but now with more quickly and ease.\n\nCashless payments boost revenue by encouraging larger purchases, making card readers a key competitive advantage and essential for staying ahead in the market.\n\nWhat are the Advantages of Integrating Card Readers\n\nCard readers not only offer hassle-free payments but also allow the user to pay with speed while empowering business owners to boost their sales; some of the three key benefits you will get as a business owner if you implement a card reader in your existing machines are\n\nIt dramatically enhances user experience by incorporating card readers within vending machines. There is no longer a need to carry cash or search for coins; now, customers can simply tap or insert a card to make a purchase. This added form of convenience will encourage greater levels of impulse purchasing and, indeed, raise overall sales.\n\nOur customer reported a 25% increase in their sales after integrating vending machine software with a card reading facility. This was a win for them and a revolution within their vending business.\n\nA cashless option promises an increase in sales for vending businesses. According to many studies, vending machines equipped with card readers can achieve an increase of between 30 and 50% when compared to traditional cash-only machines.\n\nWith card payments, there is ease of use and perceived security, so people make more frequent and large transactions.\n\nVending operators find the reliance on cash a hassle for collection, counting, and transport most regularly. Card-reading vending machines avoid all these management issues of money along with its risks of theft, loss, and concomitant labor. This, in turn, helps the operator concentrate more on fine-tuning and streamlining his vending operations and inventory.\n\nBeing a vending machine software development company, we realize how minimizing cash transactions reduces risks and smoothens operations, which is a relief to many businesses.\n\nWe have discussed vending machines and how they are getting smart, so now you have been thinking of some of the prominent features of today’s cutting-edge vending machines, let’s get into the details.\n\nCurrently, most intelligent vending machines have a large touch-screen display that is responsive enough to offer a user-like experience. These intuitive interfaces ease the customer’s interaction by allowing them to scroll through products, customize their selections, and finish up transactions with just a few taps.\n\nIn addition to credit and debit card payments, advanced vending machines with card readers often support a variety of other cashless payment methods, such as mobile wallets, contactless payments, and even loyalty program integrations.\n\nWe have enabled vendors to accept multiple forms of payment to broaden market reach, something our clients always cherish, leading to more payment, more business sales, and increased customer retention. This flexibility caters to the diverse payment preferences of modern consumers.\n\nVending machine software integrated with the card reader enables real-time tracking of sales, inventory levels, and other key performance metrics. Operators can monitor their vending business remotely and make data-driven decisions to optimize profitability.\n\nLinkitsoft is a custom vending application provider, and real-time data has empowered our clients with immediate insights into their operations.\n\nThe Mechanics Behind Vending Machines with Card Readers\n\nAlthough it looks so simply that a vending that can dispense food, groceries, and other items can accept a different kind of payment with the help of a card reader, there are a lot of other things in the background that need to be expanded, so we will get into detail for each of these components that make these vending machines so smart.\n\nWhenever a customer swipes or inserts a card in the card reader-equipped vending machine, it initiates secure communication between its payment processing system and the card issuer’s network. This verifies if a card is still valid and, at the same time, ensures that the client is available to continue the transaction.\n\nOnce the payment is authorized, the selected product from the vending machine will be dispensed, and the transaction will be registered. If customers would like to verify that their items were actually purchased, a digital receipt or a printed one can be provided for the purchase made.\n\nCard readers on vending machines have a highly secure, avant-garde encryption protocol to protect sensitive customer data used in making payments. Measures of end-to-end encryption and tokenization are applied to meet industrial standards like PCI DSS.\n\nIt simply means that credible manufacturers of vending machines and providers of vending software ensure that products and services are geared toward compliance with the industry’s standard for guaranteeing security in payment cards—Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). This certification ensures the secure handling of customers’ payment information using the best practices in the industry.\n\nWith just vending machine software consolidated with a card reader, one can get the business insight for stock level in real-time. This will help the operator to keep the inventory in close check and get alerts whenever stocking is required to keep popular items in stock.\n\nMore advanced applications of automated vending can even take care of inventory reordering, which is the initiation of relevant orders for products when the product’s inventory level falls below a certain level. This will ensure optimal inventory levels and reduce the possibility of running out of stock.\n\nThinking of varieties of vending machines with card readers?\n\nJust as vending machines consist of different components, these also exist in multiple categories of vending machines, which you can pair with card readers to make them automated.\n\nIt is only with vending machines that card readers offering fresh, healthy food like salads, sandwiches, pre-packaged meals, and more have become a very recent possibility. These vending machines have refrigeration technology to keep the products fresh and pleasant.\n\nChilled vending machines with card readers enhance purchasing ease for consumers looking for a variety of cold beverages that include sodas, juices, and bottled water. Card readers can facilitate easy transactions without cash.\n\nWith a consumer demand that’s constantly growing healthier, today’s generation of healthy vending machines with card readers now stock various nutritious snack choices, from protein bars and trail mix to baked chips.\n\nOf course, still catering toward the classic snack cravings are vendors with card readers that supply various traditional items such as chips, candy, and cookies for the more indulgent patrons.\n\nThe mix has been enhanced by ingenious vending machines that are fitted with card readers; their inventory now includes phone chargers, headphones, and other technology-related goods.\n\nThere are even vending machines fitted with card readers that offer personal care products, ranging from toiletries to hygiene products for women and over-the-counter medications, which come in handy during emergencies.\n\nAre you looking for the Perfect Vending Machine with a Card Reader? What you need is this.\n\nSo now, if you are going to opt for a vending machine with a card reader, here are some things you should take into consideration.\n\nWhile choosing a card-reader vending machine, the owner must be very selective about the location and envisage human circulation. Office buildings, transport locations, and shopping malls are most suitable since they have high human traffic. This is where location becomes very important in making sales.
