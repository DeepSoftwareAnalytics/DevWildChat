        "document": "Hi theproee, \n\n \n\n I think bjh hit the nail.\n\n \n\n For sw documentation you have two folds. The overall organization of the program i.e. the big picture, being a developer think of this as a classes diagram. How everything interconnects, reusable blocks, etc. Then you can get in more detail for a specific block if you need to. For example in one of our big programs blocks 240-244 are used for speed functions, etc you get the point.\n\n \n\n Siemens you can also document a change log inside the project under sources via a text file, it really depends up to you, you can also have a word document with all the change logs. I am sure Rockwell can do the same.\n\n \n\n It is common practice in my company to keep an internal change log in every function block, well mainly if is a complex block. So for example V1.0.0 Initial commissioning, initials, programmer, V1.0.1 fix bug XXX. As a dev you already know variable names should be very descriptive, and that goes for everything rungs, blocks, rung comments, etc.\n\n \n\n Also we have a guideline for documenting function blocks, you start with a description of the block what it is supposed to do, any other useful information for example commissioning help details, then you go and note what the block input and outputs. This helps the next developer big time when dealing with that block specially on a grand scale.\n\n \n\n I know the pain of working on a project after so long, but if you do a good job documenting and keep a good structure you will be ok. No need to know ALL the project if you are only upgrading a portion of the project, just focus on the IN/OUT you need for the upgrade. Good luck!"

        "document": "To answer your questions in turn: \n\n \n\n 1) An \"industry standard representation\" flowchart would be a combination of state diagrams and grafcet (also known as structured flow chart), or just state diagrams. State diagrams are good for processes which branch all over, while grafcet is good for processes that are long linear sequences with parallel operations. To be honest though, most people in this industry seem to get by with just hacking away until it looks like most of the bugs are gone. \n\n \n\n If you have any questions about the above, let me know, and I would be happy to go into more detail. It's not difficult once you have the basic concepts. The diagrams are also a big help in estimating the machine cycle time and optimising the sequence. \n\n \n\n 2) As for software, I've found that just drawing the diagrams with the drawing features in OpenOffice Draw or in MS-Word seems to be good enough. Anything more complicated doesn't seem to be worth the effort. \n\n \n\n I don't know the details of your machine, but I suspect you should be able to get the whole diagram on one or two pages. What you want to do is draw the diagram, then write the program, then use the diagram to test the machine. Trying to draw the diagram after the fact usually turns out to be an exercise in futility. \n\n \n\n 3) As for the model of PLC to use, a number of different small PLCs should work. The best one to choose will in large part depend on what distributors are in your area. Also look into the cost of programming software, as that can get quite expensive in some cases. \n\n \n\n 4) For programming language, you will probably be limited to ladder logic in this hardware size range. It is also a better choice because quite frankly SCL is only very rarely used and nobody who has to service the equipment later is likely to understand it. \n\n \n\n 5) Most PLCs have non-volatile RAM in which you can store information. Some have supercapacitors for short term (up to a week) storage. You probably want to install a battery for longer term backup. Most PLCs accept a battery, but it usually has to be ordered separately. \n\n \n\n 6) For the MMI panel, you usually order that with the PLC. You will usually need special software to program it (check the cost for this). \n\n \n\n 7) Some PLCs have a simple web server. It is often an add-on expansion card. Many of them can also send e-mail and FTP. \n\n \n\n 8) For remote log-in, I assume you intend that for remote programming software or troubleshooting using the programming software. \n\n \n\n 9) Your application appears to be for mobile use. Some PLCs are built for 12VDC operation. That should be another item in your requirements list. You will probably however want some sort of electrical noise filtering between the vehicle power system and the PLC. \n\n \n\n I don't know who the distributors are in your area. However, Siemens, Schneider, Koyo, Omron, Mitsubishi, etc. are all good candidates to consider. Put your hardware requirements list together (don't forget programming software), contact some local distributors, and talk to them about the application. You want to make sure that not only does the hardware work, but also that you can lay your hands on spare parts quickly when necessary."

        "document": "Description of the SEL-751 Relay Logic component, which represents a parametrizable SEL-751 Relay with built in protection functions\n\nThis component is not currently supported in TyphoonSim. Adding this component to your model will prevent you from being able to run your model in TyphoonSim. Please disable or remove this component from your model before attempting to run your model in TyphoonSim mode. The SEL-751 Relay Logic component, shown in Table 1, is a Schematic Editor library block from the Protection part, of the Microgrid library. It implements the following protection elements: Overcurrent, Time-Overcurrent, Overvoltage, and Undervoltage with the Trip/Close and Reclose Supervision Logic. The model is parametrized using two SEL-751 configuration files (Group settings and Logic settings). Initially, if the files are not loaded, the SEL-751 Relay Logic component is parametrized with the SEL-751 Factory Default values. Please refer to the SEL 751's instruction manual for the Factory Default values.\n\nThe SEL-751 model includes the following protection elements: Four levels of are available for phase (P), neutral (N), residual (G), and negative-sequence (Q) overcurrent. Each element can be torque controlled (enabled/disabled) through the use of appropriate SELogic control equations. Phase overcurrent protection operates on the maximum phase current, neutral overcurrent protection operates on the neutral current, ground overcurrent protection operates on the sum of the three phase currents, and negative-sequence overcurrent protection operates on three times the negative-sequence current. Pickup of level n of the function, in secondary amps. If set as “OFF”, the level is disabled. Intentional delay of the operation of level n of the function, in seconds. The settings necessary to set the instantaneous overcurrent elements are listed in Table 2 . The exact Setting Names, according to the element and level of interest, could be derived replacing x with “P”, “N”, “G”, or “Q”, and replacing n with “1”, “2”, “3”, or “4”. One level of inverse Time-Overcurrent Elements (TOC) is available for A-, B-, C-phases and negative-sequence (Q) overcurrent. Two levels of inverse time-overcurrent elements are available for maximum phase (P), neutral (N), and residual (R) overcurrent. Five U.S. and five IEC inverse characteristics are supported. Each element can be torque controlled (enabled/disabled) through the use of appropriate SELogic control equations (when 51P1TC := IN301 the 51P1 element is operational only if IN401 is asserted). The phase elements operate on phase A current, phase B current, and phase C current, respectively. The maximum phase inverse time-overcurrent protection operates on the maximum of the three phase currents, neutral inverse time-overcurrent protection operates on neutral current and ground inverse time-overcurrent protection operates on the sum of the three phase currents and negative-sequence overcurrent protection operates on three times the negative-sequence current. The settings necessary to set the inverse time overcurrent elements are listed in Table 3. The exact Setting Names, according to the element and level of interest, could be derived by replacing x with “A”, “B”, “C”, “P1”, “P2”, “Q”, “N1”, “N2”, “G1”, or “G2”. Pickup of the TOC element, in secondary amps. If set as “OFF”, the level is disabled. Electromechanical reset delay of the TOC element. If set as “Y”, the resetting time is computed using the selected reset curve. If set as “N”, the reset time is instantaneous. Constant time that is added to the operating time given by the characteristic curve, in seconds. Minimum response time of the TOC element, in seconds. The current transformer (CT) ratio settings configure the relay to accurately scale measured current values. The current transformer ratio settings are listed in Table 4. Phase CT ratio, Parameter that is used for determining the secondary phase currents. Neutral CT ratio, Parameter that is used for determining the secondary neutral current. When the SEL-751 model is configured to use phase-to-phase connected voltage transformers (VT), setting DELTA_Y = DELTA, the relay provides two levels of phase-to-phase overvoltage and undervoltage elements. When the SEL-751 model is configured to use phase-to-neutral connected VTs, setting DELTA_Y = WYE, the relay provides two levels of phase-to-neutral, phase-to-phase overvoltage, and undervoltage elements. Two levels of negative-sequence overvoltage elements are available regardless of the voltage transformers connections. Two levels of zero-sequence overvoltage elements are available when the voltage inputs are connected in wye configuration (DELTA_Y := WYE). When the setting “DELTA_Y” is set as “DELTA”, then phase to phase voltages are used as operating voltages. When this tap is set as “WYE”, then the phase to ground voltages are used as operating voltages. The phase undervoltage protections operate on the minimum phase operating voltage, the phase overvoltage protections operate on the maximum phase operating voltage. The zero-sequence voltage elements operate on zero-sequence voltage, while the negative-sequence voltage protection operates on three times the negative-sequence voltage. The necessary settings for the voltage elements are listed in Table 5. The exact Setting Names, according to the element and level of interest, could be derived by replacing x with “P”, “PP”, “G”, or “Q”, and replacing n with “1” or “2”. Pickup of the undervoltage level 27xn. If set as “OFF”, the level is disabled. Time delay of the undervoltage 27xn, in seconds. Pickup of the overvoltage level 59xn. If set as “OFF”, the level is disabled. Time delay of the overvoltage level 59xn, in seconds. The voltage configuration settings configure the relay voltage inputs to correctly measure and scale the voltage signals. The supported voltage settings are listed in Table 6. For additional information and examples, refer to the SEL-751 instruction manual. Phase PT ratio, Parameter that is used for determining the secondary phase voltages. The relay provides six levels of over- and underfrequency elements. Each element has independent trip level and time-delay settings, and can be torque controlled using appropriate SELogic control equations. Individual elements operate as an overfrequency protection when the trip level setting is greater than the nominal frequency setting. When the trip level setting for an element is less than the nominal frequency setting, it operates as an underfrequency protection. If the applied postive-sequence voltage is less than 10V and the applied positive-sequence current is less than 0.1 * the nominal secondary current, the measured frequency is set to the nominal frequency, and protections are not applied. The settings necessary to set over- and underfrequency elements are listed in Table 7. The exact Setting Names, according to the level of interest, could be derived by replacing n with a number between \"1\" and \"6\". Settings for over- or underfrequency elements Pickup of the over- and underfrequency element, in Hz. If set as \"OFF\", the level is disabled. Time delay of the over- and underfrequency element. Four levels of rate of change of frequency elements (81R) are available. There are three settings that are common for all four levels of protection: E81R, 81RVSUP, and 81RISUP. E81R is used to enable the number of elements you want to use. Voltage and current supervision are specified with the 81RVSUP and 81RISUP settings, respectively. If these settings are specified, a minimum positive-sequence voltage and/or current are necessary for operation of this protection. If these settings are set to OFF, this protection can operate without current and/or voltage supervision. The element is also supervised by the Relay Word FREQTRK, which ensures that the relay is tracking and measuring the system frequency. Other settings necessary to set 81R elements are listed in Table 8. The exact Setting Names, according to the level of interest, could be derived by replacing n with \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", or \"4\". Enables the number of elements you want to use. If set to \"N\", all levels are disabled. Voltage supervision. If set to \"OFF\", this supervision is disabled. Current supervision. If set to \"OFF\", this supervision is disabled. Pickup of the 81R element, in Hz/s. If set to \"OFF\", the level is disabled. Used for limiting operation of the 81R element to INC (increasing) or DEC (decreasing) frequency. Should be set to ABS if the frequency trend is not important.\n\nThe SEL-751 Relay Logic component has 3 inputs - Relay input from the User Interface (ui_out), Relay analog input (A_in), Relay digital input (D_in) - and 2 outputs Relay digital output (D_out) and Relay output to the User Interface (ui_in). ui_out is the vectorized input which consists of the 4 elements which are described in Table 9 and where signals orders are given. These signals are used to send basic manual commands to the relay. These are digital signals implemented in a positive logic, asserted when high and deasserted when low. A_in is the vectorized input which consists of the 20 elements which are described in Table 10 and where signal orders are given. These are analog signals which are equal to the measured voltages or currents. All these inputs can be easily obtained from the Three-Phase Meter component that is also part of the Microgrid library. Please refer to the SEL-751 Example model. Voltage between phases B and C. [V] Voltage between phases C and A. [V] Analog inputs that are not used. D_in is the vectorized input which consists of the 20 elements. Supported digital inputs are given in Table 11 along with the signal order. These are digital signals which can be used for digital feedback signals (from contactor for example) or used as external logic that can influence the internal protection functions. This can be defined from the imported group settings file using the SELogic equations definition in the desired protection functions. Digital inputs that are not used. D_out is the vectorized output which consists of the 20 elements. Supported digital outputs are given in Table 12 along with the signal order. Relay digital outputs are programmable and their functionality is defined from the relay logic settings file using SELogic equations for the desired digital output. Digital outputs that are not used. ui_in is the vectorized output which consists of the 227 elements which are separated in three parts: digital outputs that control user Target LEDs, analog outputs with measurements and Relay Word Bits (RWB) digital outputs. The first 20 elements are digital outputs that control the Target LEDs. All Target LEDs are fixed pre-programmed with a SEL-751 Default settings. Supported LED digital outputs are given in Table 13 with the corresponding signals' position in the ui_in vectorized output. 51AT OR 51BT OR 51CT OR 51P1T OR 51P2T 51N1T OR 51G1T OR 51N2T OR 51G2T 81D1T or 81D2T or 81D3T or 81D4T Digital outputs that are not used. The next 40 elements are reserved for analog signals of measured voltages and currents. Supported analog measurements are given in Table 14 with the corresponding signals' position in the ui_in vectorized output. Outputs that are not used. The final 167 elements of the ui_in output are Relay Word Bits (RWB) digital outputs. These RWBs are calculated from the implemented protection functions and also can be used for defining the SELogic equations in the input configuration files. If some RWB is used but is not supported in the model, it will be automatically replaced with 0 and reported in the message log of Schematic Editor. Supported RWBs are given in Table 15 with their position in the ui_in vectorized output. Logical OR of all the instantaneous overcurrent elements tripped outputs. Logical OR of all the time overcurrent elements tripped outputs. Three-phase undervoltage pickup when all three phases are below 27P1P. Three-phase overvoltage pickup when all three phases are above 59P1P. Trip SELOGIC control equation (also has been referred to as TRIPEQ). In the Example, the SEL-751 Relay Logic component is surrounded by helping subsystems where inputs and outputs are also defined. This is shown in Figure 1. The UI subsystem contains just a small and representative part of the available SEL-751 Relay Logic signals. The selection is done using Bus Selector components and numbers from the upper tables. These subsystems can be freely changed according to the specific application or reused in the other models. This whole structure is located in the wrapping SEL-751 Subsystem in order to keep everything in one place. For the more information, please refer to the provided SEL-751 Example model.\n\nIn this component tab, execution rate parameters can be specified. The faster execution rate is the rate at which RMS values are calculated using a one-cycle cosine filter. By default this value is set to 625 us, which implies 32 samples per power system cycle (50 Hz) and it matches the real SEL-751 Relay. In this model, the Faster execution rate value can be changed in order to adapt the component to the other execution rates in the model if necessary. The cosine filter will work with a different number of samples depending on the execution rate. The minimum Faster execution rate is 500 us. The Slower execution rate is the rate at which protection functions are executed, which is set to four times faster than the power system cycle by default. The Slower execution rate can also be changed and adapted to other execution rates in the model. Changing the execution rates of the SEL-751 Relay Logic can produce small differences in dynamic responses relative to the default values."
