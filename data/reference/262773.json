        "document": "I'm working with an old server (HP ProLiant DL360e Gen8) with a HP Smart Array B120i SATA/SAS controller with hardware RAID functionality and I'm struggling to get Linux installed. I have 4 drives set up in a RAID 10 configuration and when booting into a live USB of any distro (Debian, Fedora Server, whatever else...) it detects all the drives individually and trying to install the system on any of them goes alright, but then the system won't boot as the server will not detect the bootloader. At some point I got a broken GRUB installed on a random drive of the ones in the controller, so it would boot into GRUB, display an error and give me the GRUB rescue prompt. Is there something I'm doing wrong? Do I need a driver to load in the installer of my distro?"
