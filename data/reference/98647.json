        "document": "Hello! I am FROGMIRE(TEARAPARTJAMES) and I want to provide some insights into the horror genre, especially on Roblox. I often find Roblox horror games rather underwhelming and not scary due to a number of factors.\n\nIn this guide, I will cover these factors in three parts. The first will focus on the story, the second will cover visuals, and the last will discuss gameplay.\n\nThese are similar posts that provide more specific information on the horror genre, as mine is more focused on improving the current state of the genre’s landscape.\n\nHalloween and Horror\n\n BOO - The 3 Prime Elements to Spice up Your Horror Games!\n\n How to Make a Terrifying Horror Game\n\nMain stories are one of the best aspects of a horror game. In the Roblox scene, it seems that they all follow a basic structure which I have depicted below.\n\nWhile these are not all terrible ideas, they tend to be very cliché. Not to mention, they are all written terribly on Roblox.\n\nNow, what makes a story well-written? This is a very difficult question to answer as it really depends on the subject matter. But overall, it should drive the narrative with good pacing, have a constant theme, and feel somewhat gratifying to complete.\n\nNow, let’s take a look at an example of a poorly written story.\n\nThe Mimic is an episodic/chapter horror game developed by MUCDICH and several other developers, revolving around Japanese urban myths and using the concept of “books” containing chapters. However, only one “book,” the “Control’s Book,” has been completed so far. I will only be covering the first chapter, as it serves as an introduction to the series. In this chapter, the main character visits their old high school in the USA or Mexico to find their friends. They encounter a tall lady but ignore her, then search the flooded basement and are suddenly transported to Japan. They navigate through a maze that leads outside, speak to a local who warns them about a monster, and enter a cave with statue monsters. They find a Japanese cabin with a basement that leads to a hotel, then exit and find themselves in a watery area before the chapter ends. A lot is wrong with this introduction. The farther you progress into the chapters, the more the story starts to make sense. However, it remains just as messy throughout. In fact, there was a book written about it on a certain website that shall not be named. Interestingly, the book is now considered unofficial. Personally, I believe that this story was not well planned out. The developers simply created something that they found “scary” and filled it with an excessive amount of mazes, using the monster’s power as an excuse to create them.\n\nStories are one of the foundations of creating a game, yet it appears that many Roblox developers fail to recognize this.\n\nThey serve as the initial layer of atmosphere for the game, and other aspects such as lighting, sound, and level design build upon it.\n\nIf developers were to carefully plan out their stories and write them with some sort of pride, we would see improvements in the following aspects.\n\nThis may sound a bit off, but I don’t think that stories matter as much on the Roblox platform.\n\nYou may be wondering why stories don’t hold much significance for me on this platform. The reason is that horror games outside of the Roblox platform tend to delve into darker subjects(it’s called horror for a reason), such as guilt over killing a loved one and childhood trauma. I don’t believe that such subjects, and others like them, can be communicated effectively on Roblox.\n\nI should also mention that Roblox doesn’t generally promote darker themes, so it’s important to be cautious when exploring such topics.\n\nEnvironmental storytelling is the act of conveying a smaller story or guiding the player with cues from the environment.\n\nAnother lacking area in a number of Roblox horror games is a lack of environmental storytelling.\n\nI cannot really think of any games off the top of my head on Roblox that utilize environmental storytelling very well other than BUNKER.\n\nOutside of Roblox, there are many different games that use environmental storytelling. The Fallout series is one of them which is well known for its environmental storytelling, commonly using skeletons, logs, and even level design to convey a smaller narrative within the larger narrative.\n\nHow do you go about using environmental storytelling?\n\nGame Maker’s Toolkit provides a well-made video on the topic.\n\nModel quality is another thing that matters in almost all games. Now, when I refer to the quality I am referring to the quality of consistency between all models of the game.\n\nMore recently, there has been a focus on creating more detailed character meshes. However, it seems as if this approach is flawed as the environments have not been receiving the same level of attention.\n\nI will now provide an example of poor model quality.\n\nNow, it may seem like I am singling out The Mimic, but it serves as a perfect example of a poorly made-horror game.\n\nEverything is wrong in this scene: the desks do not match the character model, the light above is not casting light, and the decals on the wall of vine-like leaves are too detailed when compared to the character.\n\nA good example of consistency is DOORS, which I would like to think most developers would have seen by now.\n\nHow does one solve this annoying and overly common issue?\n\nI believe that this is something that entirely depends on the creators’ abilities to design and develop a game. If you excel at designing and creating highly detailed character models, try to have them match your environment, and aim for balance.\n\nThere is a very well-made RDC presentation that covers developing game worlds and covers this issue.\n\nThe first thing to address is lighting. It should not be excessively dark unless it is absolutely necessary.\n\nFor example, in the game I am currently working on, very dark lighting is needed to convey that exploring at night is a bad idea, as that is when monsters come out. Most people are not scared of the dark itself; rather, they are scared of what may be in it.\n\nPost-processing should not be overused. If your game constantly uses DepthOfField or Blur, please provide players with the option to disable it.\n\nThat is all for lighting, as it can be a challenging topic to discuss universally.\n\nAt the very core of roughly almost all Roblox horror games, I found that they all share the same formula/cycle of gameplay.\n\nAs shown in the image above, the gameplay of a typical Roblox horror game follows a cycle of walking and then performing one of three actions: navigating a maze, solving item collection puzzles (such as finding keys or spirit butterflies), or running away in both scripted and unscripted chase scenes.\n\nDOORS, The Mimic, Apeirophobia, ELMIRA, and countless other Roblox horror games are guilty of having a repetitive gameplay loop. Personally, I cannot find myself replaying these games. However, it seems that they are very popular, which means that some people do enjoy them. So, if you are trying to make a quick buck off of Premium Payout, then go ahead with this gameplay loop!\n\nHow do you differentiate yourself from this gameplay loop?\n• Exploration: You can implement some form of exploration. Encourage players to explore and discover new things by adding hidden paths, secrets, and even Easter eggs. You can award badges, in-game currency, and items as rewards. Yes, it involves more walking, but it’s optional.\n• Puzzles: You can actually implement puzzles that are not based on collecting items. Challenge the player’s intellect with creative puzzle designs. There are so many cool puzzle ideas out there, and you can definitely come up with even more if you put your mind to it!\n• Environmental Hazards: You can add environmental hazards that challenge the player’s skill and also add to the horror, especially if they are required to navigate them mid-chase.\n• Combat: You can add combat. Combat is a divisive element in horror games as some argue that it makes them less scary. However, you can always balance this out by implementing a powerful enemy, like Mr. X from RE2, to counter the feeling of strength that comes with wielding a weapon.\n\nI will not be discussing designs of enemies, but I will say that using a girl in a white dress with black hair(onryō) is not scary. It’s a cliché.\n\nThe enemies or monsters in these games are generally basic and have the same behavior. They patrol specific points on the map at random or have a designated patrol path. When the player enters their line of sight, the player’s field of view will increase, and a chase theme will play or something similar will happen. You will have a significantly lower walk speed compared to them. If they catch you, you will die instantly and a jumpscare will play.\n\nInstead of having enemies patrol aimlessly, give them specific tasks to perform. Make them do something like eating, cleaning floors, programming, or anything else that makes sense for their character or role in the game. I would also lower the speed of the enemy to give players a chance to escape, remove generic jump scares (more about them below), and replace them with something more brutal, such as a death animation. I doubt a monster will kill me by shaking its head. When it comes to instakilling, I would also recommend removing it. It’s much more terrifying to know the monster was close to killing you than having it kill you instantly when it gets close.\n\nI cannot tell you how much I hate jumpscares in Roblox horror games.\n\nJumpscares are most commonly used in Roblox in areas where there is no need for them, such as death animations or random triggers. While they make sense in FNAF-like games, they do not work in a game where I can see the enemy running toward me. It won’t scare me if I hear a chase theme and see my field of view change prior to the jumpscare, as I know it’s going to happen.\n\nI should have an expectation that something is going to happen, yet it should not be predictable. Alternatively, you can also surprise the players by doing a complete 180 and have nothing happen.\n\nAlso, having the enemy shake around like it’s having a seizure is not scary; it’s rather goofy-looking, especially if it lasts for more than 2 seconds.\n\nWhile I did not mention sound design in its own part, it is another lacking aspect in a number of Roblox horror games. I think a lot more focus needs to be put into the subtle sounds.\n\nI will list a couple of sound ideas below.\n\nIn most Roblox games, you only hear sounds such as footsteps or buzzing fluorescent lights, which can become repetitive. It would be great to see more games utilize their own soundtracks. However, it is understandable that not everyone has the musical talent or the resources to pay for it.\n\nI will list a couple of games that use their own soundtracks.\n\nwow, that was a lot of words… time for a couple more.\n\nHorror games on this platform are struggling to create anything that is actually horrifying. The genre is saturated with mediocre and terrible horror games (sorry, but it’s true). However, I believe that there is potential for well-made horror games on this platform. I hope this post will help developers avoid saturating the market with more poorly designed horror games and instead begin creating better horror experiences.\n\nThanks for reading or skipping down to the bottom of this topic!"

        "document": "THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUOUS SUPPORT!\n\nWelcome! I’m Natt, and I’m here to show you how to make a horror game! This topic takes a sort of theoretical approach, meaning I won’t directly show you how to make something in Studio, but give you the dos and don’ts of making a horror game before you jump into developing it. It’s also worth mentioning that this topic is suited more for narrative driven horror games. Even if your horror game differs, you may still find some points made useful. Part 1 - Talking about what you’re going to be doing with the game - mainly how to write a script for your game and how to manage it. I’ll discuss with you what to do when issues occur. Part 2 - Talking about what horror elements you should have, while also explaining what to avoid when writing. Helpful replies are mentioned in this part! Here are some alternative topics to this one that are worth checking out:\n• @TheCarbyneUniverse’s BOO - The 3 Prime Elements to Spice up Your Horror Games!\n\nEverything starts with just an idea. To come up with an idea and shape it into a game, here’s what to do:\n\nTry to think of something original. If you get inspired by another game, you will want to have a lot of aspects that the original has, therefore making you get the original game’s aspects. People will recognize this and compare it, which is usually not something you want especially if it is a downgrade.\n\nThis doesn’t imply that you shouldn’t get inspired by other games - after all that is how many successful games were created. A smart move is getting an idea from one game and then adding something of your own to it to make it even better.\n\nIf you’re writing a script, avoid putting it on hiatus. After it has been days, even weeks later of returning to the project, it might be hard to be as creative as before. And, fully finish a thought or idea before taking a break.\n\nDon’t start working on the game if you haven’t finished writing the script for the entire game. You don’t have to plan game updates ahead of time though, since those will be based around the work you have already done.\n\nLast, but not least…\n\nSimply put, writing isn’t always easy. Though I would argue starting is the hardest, after you’ve got an idea it’s smoother sailing.\n\nAnywho, with writing, you’re testing your creativity and your abilities. If you want to achieve your goals in writing, you must always have courage and the right mindset. Motivation helps.\n\nFun is another key factor. You might be reading this topic because you need a story (or you just want your game to make sense) - not because you want to write one. You should find entertainment in this sort of stuff for it to be most efficient. Explore your options and get immersed - all options are in your imagination after all!\n\nSUMMARY: I’ve explained important things about planning and writing. In short, it’s important to be original, to write with the right mindset and technique, and to finish writing before heading to Studio.\n\n2. Struggles that come with writing.\n• You might be struggling with ideas. Maybe you thought out this amazing idea, but you later realize it was used in a popular game, and putting it into yours would seem like blatantly copying it.\n• You’re struggling with how to put your thoughts into words.\n• Maybe you think that what you want in your game is too complex, aka you won’t have the skill to script, build, etc.\n\nSomething that can help in these situations is just, plain thinking. A lot of it, without distractions. You can come on to DevForum but ultimately, you yourself know best what you want to do, or anyone who you’re writing with. It’s inevitable, it happens.\n• Make sure to include easter eggs throughout your game.\n\nWith Easter Eggs, players may be able to discover new endings to games. Perhaps, if a game is a cat-chases-mouse type of horror game, you can (maybe) learn about the cat’s backstory. We don’t see that often. It is a nice touch though. Usually in games, the threat, let’s take it in this case - a killer, we don’t know anything about the killer. The focus is just trying to escape it.\n\nPlayers often visit the badges tab. In there, you can hint to them a lot of things. Discovering easter eggs can award badges. It’s another layer of gameplay committed players can explore.\n\nSUMMARY: Explained what Easter Eggs are and how to make efficient use of them, where to put them, etc, while also suggesting how to resolve issues that come with writing.\n\nNow that you know the basics of getting started, here are some tips to, well, make your game more scary of course :]\n\nHow would we achieve this?\n\nHere are 16 detailed in-depth tips that are sure to help! Be on the lookout for updates.\n\n1. Make sure that your game has at least a little of each horror element:\n\nI know that Roblox’s limitations can suck, so making less use of some elements is respectable, and sometimes it’s the only thing that can be done.\n\n2. Don’t let horror begin right upon joining\n\nLet players get familiar with the environment, lighting, controls, feel, and atmosphere of the game, as well as the plot (if needed). By doing this, you are allowing players to get comfortable with the aforementioned elements of the game which will enhance their experience from the get-go.\n\nThis is a great way to mess with the player’s minds. We’ve seen tons of games execute this idea already, and it turned out well.\n\n4. Include the most common phobias and fears in your game\n\nMost devs would first think about Nyctophobia, an extreme fear of the dark. However, what if we could spice that up with Arachnophobia, extreme fear of spiders, and other tiny creatures of the sort?\n\nOther common phobias include Astraphobia, Agoraphobia, (the most important of all in horror!), Mysophobia. It’s fun to incorporate these in your game.\n\nAstraphobia - fear of lightning\n\n Agoraphobia - fear of being entrapped, unable to escape\n\n Mysophobia - fear of dirtiness and filth (environment)\n\n5. The use of people/“beings” in distress.\n\nWhile overdone in a variety of cliches, these can prove effective in your game if implemented correctly. These could include crying, screaming, heavy breathing/panting, etc. or anything that will hint at mental instability.\n\nMake sure to always think about the placement of these, and if you should even use them in the first place. They’re most effective when used when they connect to the game’s lore/plot!\n\nWhile you don’t need to do this to make a game scary, having a player see their goofy avatars surely downgrades the scariness at times. Plus, they can see their surroundings more easily when zoomed out which gives them an advantage, PLUS (lol), having it zoomed in makes the game more realistic and scary, like how they would experience the game in real life.\n\nTo help yourself when making the game in Studio, you don’t need to have it locked in 1st person, as it can get annoying to test the game. You can always easily zoom in to get an idea of what it’ll be, right? Right at the end of creating the game, you can set it to 1st person.\n\n7. Don’t force or overuse jumpscares and rely on them\n\nJumpscares are a bit overrated, especially those that don’t even have anything to do with the actual story, like seeing a shadow behind a corner or hearing some whispers… Not to mention a horror game can play out just fine without a single jumpscare.\n\nI wouldn’t say jumpscares are bad to incorporate, however. You can have them if they make sense and enhance the experience.\n\nMake sure to include jumpscares at the right time and setting, when players least expect them. You can try and ask yourself “Is this a place where I would expect a jumpscare?” If the answer is yes, maybe don’t place the jumpscare there, and incorporate it elsewhere.\n\nYou can use the uncanny to create environments in which players will be. After all, environments are one of the most important factors of games.\n\n9. Let players choose a difficulty (if your game supports it)\n\nI recommend making your difficulties the following, and I’ll explain why: Normal, Hard, Extreme.\n\nEasy difficulties feel less intimidating which may not be a good thing.\n\nNormal should be easy to beat (easy), Hard gets tougher (normal), and Extreme (hard) for those up for the challenge. It’s the easy-normal-hard formula but with different names.\n\n10. Always make the player feel weak and vulnerable\n• It’s a good way of scaring people, to make them feel powerless. Some creative ways of doing this are limiting player movement speeds or any other way to disorient them. You can make the screen darker and darker to represent fear levels, and so on.\n• If combat is an option, make it feel unreliable. Like a double-edged sword, where the player is put at risk while using it. A good example of this would be TRAVERSAL - Roblox\n\n11. Isolate the player from other people… if you’d like.\n\nHaving others going through everything gives us a little bit of comfort. If you can, try to minimize the interactions with players, NPCs, etc. by being separated. Don’t do this if it ruins your story, though. It’s supposed to enhance it, so if that’s not what it does then move on.\n\n12. Make likable main characters (if… yknow, there are any.)\n\nOne of the most important things in video games are characters that will follow you through the game:\n• you can relate to, always feel what they feel + like you’re them (if you are playing as a different avatar/someone that isn’t you and there is monologue/dialogue)\n• Make them look good visually, but fitting in the style of the game as well\n• you’re happy whenever you see them - a character you can develop a deep bond with\n• with a long time spent apart, you might start to think about when you will see them again\n• you wonder how they will impact the story\n\n13. Let players use their imaginations and feel emotion outside of horror\n\nIn general, horror games are made to scare you. But, what if they could make you feel sad, feel… happy?\n\nExample: Let them discover the backstory to the culprit by clues found throughout the game – this doesn’t always need to be hidden, though! It seems like a way to mess with the players’ emotions. For example, they find something sad about the villain, their motives and thoughts…\n\nIf you’re using a flashlight as your main light source in the game, make the player pay a price for it. Examples: make “the” creature come closer to you, or drain your flashlight’s batteries, make it noisy…\n\nAdding to my previous point with a little detail; if you’re using a battery system, make it fair and scale it with the game difficulty. Also, if batteries are something that players can pick up and put in their flashlights, then: don’t scatter them on floors and tables for no reason. Hide them in drawers, cabinets, and perhaps devices like radios or toys in which players can find batteries via interaction.\n\n15. Add flavor text to items and make them more interactable\n\nThere’s not much to say, however, in games, it’s a nice little touch and gives them only a little more life.\n\nAdd monologue when interacting with or inspecting items (but don’t make it annoying like in The Walking Dead game franchises… if you know you know lol) - but moving on to the last tip.\n\n16. Punish players for not paying attention to the game\n\nPlayers tend to do what they need to do to move forward with the story and get the ending. They pay attention to things they must, such as other characters, the story, and stats (hunger, HP, sanity?) But, do they pay attention to the environment and the outside world?\n\nFor example, you have a pet at home. Like, a pet fish. If you go out and do your own thing with the storyline, when you come home your fish dies because you forgot to feed it before you went out… Just to throw people off-guard. This isn’t exactly common in horror games, but it would be a nice touch.\n\nThank you for reading this topic.\n\nYou can tell me what you think by voting on the polls below!\n• I ask that you don’t vote unless you have read the chapter(s) you’re voting on. Don’t jump to conclusions by taking a glance, even if you’d rate it a 10~!\n\nOut of 10, how informative did you find Part 1?\n\nOut of 10, how informative did you find Part 2?\n\nPart 3 hasn’t been released, so I haven’t put up a poll for it… yet.\n\nFollow up with the topic to get notified of Pt. 3’s release.\n\n-Written by @izNatt with small help from @google\n\n -Awesome replies @mentioned"

        "document": "Now i love Roblox horror games and there’s great ones out there! But every time i play one it shares tropes that i see in pretty much all of them. So i just want to talk about it here to maybe inspire some people to make better horror games!\n\nJumpscares\n\n You might of heard this before but… Jumscares are, WAY too over used in Roblox horror games I personally think jumpscares are cheap and a bad way to “scare” people, usually its your do something and a loud sound plays with a scary visual. The problem with jumpscares is they are effective the first time you do it and maybe even the second time! But if used excessively can just desensitize the player and they wont jump anymore especially when you play as many horror games as i do jumpscares start to feel… Boring and dry. If you really want to add jumpscares i would really recommend you try to add a small amount OR completely remove jumpscares all together. (yes this is possible)\n\nSound design\n\n Most people i think know this but don’t do anything about it. Most games just have natural ambience meaning things like wind, doors, clicking of switches, generators and other normal sounding things which IS important but other sounds are important as well. A couple games with good sound design are PINSTRIPE MURDERS and Recovery. Recovery especially has great sound design. I’m not saying you have to spend a year and learn sound design but maybe watch a video or two on it and try your best!\n\ntutorials\n\n This pretty much goes for every type of game but is useful in horror games as well. Having no tutorials is a great way to get your player immersed which is really important in a horror game, I always see this a lot, When i do something to unlock another thing the game should not tell me where to go or what to do that makes your game feel more like a check list of things you HAVE to do instead of figuring it out for yourself. A good way for people to know what do to without being told is have things insinuate it from the start like when you find a key you think that must mean there’s a locked door somewhere. Or when you find a gear there’s a broken machine somewhere. If you would like a amazing example on invisible tutorials then there’s a amazing video on YouTube made by game makers toolkit about half life’s invisible tutorials that i suggest you go watch if your interested.\n\nPlay on existing fears\n\n Some people have a fear of the dark or a fear of clowns or… A fear of the unknown.\n\n A good example of this is well Five Nights At Freddy’s. A lot of people either were or are scared of Animatronics. Which is exactly why Fnaf was made and a part of why it was scary to people. Another good example of this is all the lists of phobia games that are on Roblox, These games are taking an existing fear or unease that people feel and turning it into a nightmare experience.\n\nDont repeat\n\n Find new ways to do things in your games, If you use the same method of scaring the player once then don’t do that method again for a long time or it will become predictable and in turn not scary anymore. This goes for gameplay as well, Almost every horror game i see has the same type of gameplay for most of the game… Brining item A to item B. This will almost defiantly always be used in horror games but try to find more interesting ways to bring item A to item B and keep mixing it up through out the game, this makes it feel less repetitive and less boring.\n\nThat’s pretty much all i have to say and i hope you don’t take most of this as me trying to tell you how to make games. If you think everything iv said is completely wrong and you don’t want to listen then that’s fine. The most important thing is that you have fun making the games but maybe try and be a little more mindful if your game is fun to be played.\n\nI did spend a long time typing this all out so please show some support!"

        "document": "The best roblox horror games have a story, the game play should emphasize the story and build onto its themes. Lets say the game is about a wastelander attempting to find shelter in a place that’s full of monsters, adding on something like hunger builds on the theme of being a wastelander, toxic rain emphasizes the need for shelter so on and so forth.\n\nAlso you want the players mind to be as over active as possible so they are thinking. Add hints to there being a larger monster, add hints to there being something just around the corner. Also try to have puzzles in the game to get their brain ready and active to look at things they wouldn’t normally notice.\n\nAnother thing to note is dread, once a players mind is active, you can get them to dread what’s coming up next. for example adding in things that they hold value too, such as cute toys or npc’s which the player will grow attached too, then, build up to a scene in which you can take them away and make sure the player knows that it’s coming. This will leave them dreading the future, knowing it will happen but not knowing when\n\nAnother thing you can do to scare the player is a quick switch, by quickly ramping up the intensity you can trigger a flight or fight response. Have chill moments in your game so the player will lower their guard, from there you can either slowly build up which will set the players exceptions, or randomly quickly begin to ramp up the intensity. The latter becomes far more effective if you’ve done the former multiple times before.\n\nJumpscares are not necessary in the slightest, they are the least scary part of any horror good horror game and if they are the most scary part of yours your doing something wrong. Darkness also isn’t necessary for a horror game.\n\nRemember the best horror gives the players time to think, time to build up the monster in their heads.\n\nGood build up to things, some parts made me scared\n\nlingering fear of there being a monster near by.\n\nChill, leaves you time to think, quickly flips its head and freaks you out.\n\nThe best roblox horror game by far."
