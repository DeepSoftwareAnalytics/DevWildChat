        "document": "CSS allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS, what the basic syntax looks like, and how your browser applies CSS to HTML to style it.\n\nIn this article, we will take a simple HTML document and apply CSS to it, learning some practical details of the language along the way. We will also review the CSS syntax features you've not looked at yet.\n\nAs you know from your study of HTML, elements can have attributes that give further detail about the element being marked up. In CSS you can use attribute selectors to target elements with certain attributes. This lesson will show you how to use these very useful selectors.\n\nThe next set of selectors we will look at are referred to as pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements. There are a large number of these, and they often serve quite specific purposes. Once you know how to use them, you can look through the different types to see if there is something which works for the task you are trying to achieve.\n\nThe final selectors we will look at are called combinators. Combinators are used to combine other selectors in a way that allows us to select elements based on their location in the DOM relative to other elements (for example, child or sibling).\n\nEverything in CSS has a box around it, and understanding these boxes is key to being able to create more complex layouts with CSS, or to align items with other items. In this lesson, we will take a look at the CSS Box model. You'll get an understanding of how it works and the terminology that relates to it.\n\nThe aim of this lesson is to develop your understanding of some of the most fundamental concepts of CSS — the cascade, specificity, and inheritance — which control how CSS is applied to HTML and how conflicts between style declarations are resolved.\n\nCSS rules contain declarations, which in turn are composed of properties and values. Each property used in CSS has a value type that describes what kind of values it is allowed to have. In this lesson, we will take a look at some of the most frequently used value types, what they are, and how they work.\n\nUnderstanding how big the different features in your design will be is important. In this lesson we will summarize the various ways elements get a size via CSS and define a few terms about sizing that will help you in the future.\n\nIn this lesson, we will take a look at some of the creative things you can do with CSS backgrounds and borders. From adding gradients, background images, and rounded corners, backgrounds and borders are the answer to a lot of styling questions in CSS.\n\nIn this lesson we will take a look at how certain special elements are treated in CSS. Images, other media, and form elements behave a little differently from regular boxes in terms of your ability to style them with CSS. Understanding what is and isn't possible can save some frustration, and this lesson will highlight some of the main things that you need to know.\n\nThis article will give you guidance on how to go about debugging a CSS problem, and show you how the DevTools included in all modern browsers can help you to find out what is going on."

        "document": "It is technically true that anyone can cook. But there’s a difference between actually knowing how to prepare a delicious meal and hoping for the best as you throw a few ingredients in a pot. Just like web development, you might know the ingredients— , , —but not everyone knows how to turn those ingredients into a beautiful, easy-to-use website.\n\nWhenever you use HTML and CSS, you are designing—giving form and structure to content so it can be understood by someone else. People have been designing for centuries and have developed principles along the way that are applicable to digital interfaces today. These principles manifest in three key areas: how words are displayed (typography), how content is arranged (spacing), and how personalty is added (color). Let’s discover how to use each of these web design ingredients through the mindset of a developer with CSS properties and guidelines to take the guesswork out of web design.\n\nWebsites that are easy to read don’t happen by mistake. In fact, Taimur Abdaal wrote an entire article on the topic that’s chock-full of advice for developers working with type. We’re going to focus specifically on two fundamental principles of design that can help you display words in a more visually pleasing and easy-to-read way: repetition and hierarchy.\n\nUse repetition for consistency and maintainability\n\nRepetition comes fairly naturally on the web thanks to the importance of reusability in software. For example, CSS classes allow you to define a particular style for text and then reuse that style across the site. This results in repeating, consistent text styles for similar content which helps users navigate the site.\n\nIf, for example, you are working on styles for a new paragraph, first consider if there is existing content that has a similar style and try to use the same CSS class. If not, you can create a new class with a generic name that can be repeated elsewhere in your site. Think as opposed to or as opposed to . The first examples can be used across your site as opposed to the second which are scoped to specific components. You can even add a prefix like to indicate that the class is used specifically for text styles. This method will reduce the CSS file size and complexity while making it much easier to update global styles in the future.\n\nIn design, there are endless ways to experiment with styles. Designers can sometimes go a little crazy with their font styles by creating numerous slight variations of similar styles. However, in code, it’s valuable to restrict text styles to a minimum. Developers should urge designers to combine similar styles in order to reduce code weight and increase reusability and consistency.\n\nHierarchy is something you really only notice when it’s not there. In typography, hierarchy refers to the visual difference between various pieces of text. It’s the distinction between headings, paragraphs, links, and other text styles. This distinction is made by choosing different fonts, colors, size, capitalization, and other properties for each type of text content. Good hierarchy makes complex information easier to digest and guides users through your content.\n\nOut of the box, HTML provides some hierarchy (like how the font size of headings gets smaller as you go from to ), but CSS opens the door for even more creativity. By giving tags an even larger font size, you can quickly establish greater difference in size between heading levels—and therefore more hierarchy. To create more variety, you can also change the , , and properties.\n\nWith typography, we need to make sure it is as easy to read as possible. The greatest overall factor in readability is the font you choose—which is a huge topic. There are many factors that determine how “readable” a font is. Some fonts are made specifically to be used as headings or short lines of text; these are called “display” fonts, and they often have more personality than fonts designed to be used for text. Unique flourishes and quirks make display fonts harder to read at small sizes and when part of a large paragraph. As a rule of thumb, use a more straightforward font for text and only use display fonts for headings.\n\nIf you’re in a pinch and need a readable font, try Google Fonts. Add a paragraph of text to the preview field and size it roughly how it will display on your website. You can then narrow down your results to serif or sans-serif and scan the list of fonts for one that is easy to read. Roboto, Noto Sans, Merriweather, and PT Serif are all very readable options.\n• The main paragraph should be between and ( and ) depending on the font you choose.\n• Manually set (the vertical space between two lines of text) to make your text less cramped and easier to read. Start with (that is 1.25 times the ) for headings and at least for paragraphs (but no more than ) and adjust from there. The longer the line of text, the larger the should be. To keep your text flexible, avoid adding a unit to your . Without a unit the you set will be proportional to your . For example, and would give you a line height of 27 pixels. If you changed your font size to on smaller screens, the computed line height would then change to 24 pixels automatically.\n• Pay attention to how many characters are in a line of text and aim for 45 and 75 characters long (including punctuation and spaces). Doing so reduces reading fatigue for your users by limiting the eye and head movement needed to follow a line of text. With the variable nature of the web, it’s impossible to completely control line length, but you can use values and breakpoints to prevent lines of text from getting too long. Generally speaking, the shorter the line of text, the faster it will be to scan for quick reading. And don’t worry too much about counting the characters in every line. Once you do it a few times, you’ll develop a sense for what looks right.\n\nAfter looking at typography, you can take a step back and examine the layout, or spacing, of your content. Movement and proximity are two design principles that relate to spacing.\n\nMovement refers to how your eye moves through the page or the flow of the page. You can use movement to direct a user’s eye in order to tell a story, point to a main action item, or encourage them to scroll. This is done by structuring the content within individual components and then arranging those components to form the layout of the page. By paying attention to how your eye moves through content, you can help users know where to look as they scan the page.\n\nUnlike books, which tend to have very linear structure, websites can be more creative with their layout—in literally endless ways. It is important to make sure you are intentional with how you layout content and do so in a way which guides users through your content as easily as possible.\n\nConsider these three examples above. Which is the easiest to follow? The arrangement on the left draws your eye off the screen to the left due to how the image is positioned which makes it hard to find the button. In the center option, it’s easy to skip over the headline because the image is too large in comparison. On the right, the heading draws your attention first and the image is composed so that it points to the main action item—the button.\n\nWhite space is a helpful tool for creating strong movement, but it’s easy to use too much or too little. Think about how you are using it to direct the user’s eye and divide your content. When used well, users won’t notice the whitespace itself but will be able to better focus on the content you are presenting. For example, you can use whitespace to separate content (instead of a colored box) which results in a less cluttered layout.\n\nWhen objects are closer together, they are perceived as being related. By controlling spacing around elements, you can imply relationships between them. It can be helpful to create a system for spacing to help build consistency through repetition and avoid the use of random numbers. This system is based off the default browser font size (1rem or 16px) and uses distinct values that cover most scenarios:\n\nYou can use Sass or CSS variables so that the values are kept consistent across the project. A system might look like this—but use whatever you’re comfortable with because naming things is hard:\n\nColor greatly affects a website’s personality. When used well, it gives pages life and emotion; used poorly, it can distract from the content, or worse, make it inaccessible. Color goes hand in hand with most design principles. It can be used to create movement by directing users’ eyes and can be used to create emphasis by calling attention to the most important action items.\n\nWith color, it can be hard to know where to start. To help, you can use a four-step process to guide your color choices and build a color palette for the site.\n\nYou have to know the mood or attitude of your site and brand before choosing colors. Look at your content and decide what you are trying to communicate. Is it funny, informative, retro, loud, somber? Typically, you can boil down the mood of your site to a few adjectives. For example, you might summarize The North Face as adventurous and rugged while Apple would be minimalistic and beautiful.\n\nWith your mood in mind, try to visualize a color that represents it. Start with the color’s saturation (how intense the color is) and brightness (how close the color is to white or black). If your mood is upbeat or flashy, a lighter (more saturated) color is probably best. If your mood is serious or reserved, a darker (less saturated) color is better.\n\nNext, choose a hue. Hue refers to what most people think of as colors—where does is fall on the rotation of the color wheel? The hue of a color is what gives it the most meaning. People tend to associate hues with certain ideas. For instance, red is often associated with power or danger and green relates to money or nature. It can be helpful to look at similar websites or brands to see what colors they use—although you don’t need to follow their lead. Don’t be afraid to experiment!\n\nSometimes, two or three main colors are needed, but this is not necessary. Think about the colors of different brands. Some use a single color, and others have a main color and one or two that support it. Coca-Cola uses its distinct red. IKEA is mostly blue with some yellow. Tide is orange with some blue and yellow. Depending on your site’s mood, you might need a few colors. Try using a tool like Adobe Color or Coolors), both of which allow you to add a main color and then try different color relationships, like complementary or monochromatic, to quickly see if any work well.\n\nNow that you’ve narrowed things down and found your main color(s), it’s time to expand your scope with a palette that gives your project versatility and constraint—here’s a methodology I’ve found helpful. Tints and shades are the trick here. Tints are made by mixing your main color(s) with white, and shades are made by mixing with black. You can quickly create an organized system with Sass color functions:\n\nTo round out your palette, you’ll need a few more colors, like a white and black. Try creating a “rich black” using a dark, almost black shade of your main color and, on the other end of the spectrum, pick a few light grays that are tinted with your main color. Tinting the white and black adds a little more personality to your page and helps create a cohesive look and feel.\n\nLast but not least, if you are working on an interactive product, you should add colors for success, warning, and error states. Typically a green, yellow, and red work for these but consider how you can adjust the hue to make them fit better with your palette. For example, if your mood is friendly and your base color is green, you might want to desaturate the error state colors to make the red feel less negative.\n\nYou can do this with the mix Sass color function by giving it your base color, the default error color, and the percentage of base color that you want to mix in with the error color. Adding desaturate functions helps tone down the colors:\n\nWhen it comes to the web, there’s one color principle that you have to pay extra attention to: contrast. That’s what we’ll cover next.\n\nColor contrast—the difference in saturation, brightness, and hue between two colors—is an important design principle for ensuring the web is accessible to those with low vision or color blindness. By ensuring there is enough contrast between your text and whatever is behind it on your site will be more accessible for all sighted users. When looking at accessibility, be sure to follow the color contrast guidelines provided by ’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ( ). There are many tools that can help you follow these guidelines, including the inspect panel in Chrome’s dev tools.\n\nNow, it’s time to put these principles to practice! You can use these processes and CSS tips to help take the guesswork out of design and create better solutions. Start with what you are familiar with, and eventually, the design principles mentioned here will become second nature.\n\nIf you’re looking for even more practical tips, Adam Wathan and Steve Schoger wrote about some of their favorites."

        "document": "Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements. For example, this CSS selects paragraph text, setting the color to red:\n• Inside your folder, create another new folder called .\n• Using a text editor, paste the three lines of CSS shown above into a new file.\n• Save the file inside your folder with a filename of . To make the code work, we still need to apply this CSS (above) to your HTML document. Otherwise, the styling won't change the appearance of the HTML.\n• Open your file. Paste the following line inside the HTML head (between the and tags):\n• Save and load it in your browser. You should see something like this: If your paragraph text is red, congratulations! Your CSS is working.\n\nLet's dissect the CSS code for red paragraph text to understand how it works: The whole structure is called a ruleset. (The term ruleset is often referred to as just rule.) Note the names of the individual parts: This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, elements). To style a different element, change the selector. This is a single rule like . It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style. These are features of an HTML element that you can change the values of, to make it styled differently. (In this example, is a property of the elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule. To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. (For example, there are many values in addition to .) Note the other important parts of the syntax:\n• Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ( )\n• Within each declaration, you must use a colon ( ) to separate the property from its value or values.\n• Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon ( ) to separate each declaration from the next one. To modify multiple property values in one ruleset, write them separated by semicolons, like this:\n\nThere are many different types of selectors. The examples above use element selectors, which select all elements of a given type. But we can make more specific selections as well. Here are some of the more common types of selectors: What does it select All HTML elements of the specified type. The element on the page with the specified ID. On a given HTML page, each id value should be unique. The element(s) on the page with the specified class. Multiple instances of the same class can appear on a page. The element(s) on the page with the specified attribute. The specified element(s), but only when in the specified state. (For example, when a cursor hovers over a link.) \n\nselects , but only when the mouse pointer is hovering over the link. There are many more selectors to discover. To learn more, see our selectors tutorials, starting with Basic selectors.\n\nNow that we've explored some CSS fundamentals, let's improve the appearance of the example by adding more rules and information to the file.\n• First, find the output from Google Fonts that you previously saved from What will your website look like?. Add the element somewhere inside your 's head (anywhere between the and tags). It looks something like this: This code links your page to a style sheet that loads the Open Sans font family with your webpage.\n• Next, delete the existing rule you have in your file. It was a good test, but let's not continue with lots of red text.\n• Add the following lines (shown below), replacing the assignment with your selection from What will your website look like?. The property refers to the font(s) you want to use for text. This rule defines a global base font and font size for the whole page. Since is the parent element of the whole page, all elements inside it inherit the same and . html { font-size: 10px; /* px means \"pixels\": the base font size is now 10 pixels high */ font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif; /* this should be the rest of the output you got from Google Fonts */ } Note: Anything in CSS between and is a CSS comment. The browser ignores comments as it renders the code. CSS comments are a way for you to write helpful notes about your code or logic.\n• Now let's set font sizes for elements that will have text inside the HTML body (<h1>, , and ). We'll also center the heading. Finally, let's expand the second ruleset (below) with settings for line height and letter spacing to make body content more readable. Adjust the values as you like. Your work-in-progress should look similar to this:\n\nSomething you'll notice about CSS as you use it more: a lot of it is about boxes. This includes setting size, color, and position. Most HTML elements on your page can be thought of as boxes sitting on top of other boxes. CSS layout is mostly based on the box model. Each box taking up space on your page has properties like:\n• , the space around the content. In the example below, it is the space around the paragraph text.\n• , the solid line that is just outside the padding.\n• , the space around the outside of the border. In this section we also use:\n• , the color behind an element's content and padding.\n• , the color of an element's content (usually text).\n• sets a drop shadow on the text inside an element.\n• sets the display mode of an element. (keep reading to learn more) To continue, let's add more CSS. Keep adding these new rules at the bottom of . Experiment with changing values to see what happens.\n\nYou may have noticed there's a horrible gap at the top of the body. That happens because browsers apply default styling to the h1 element (among others). That might seem like a bad idea, but the intent is to provide basic readability for unstyled pages. To eliminate the gap, we overwrite the browser's default styling with the setting . Next, we set the heading's top and bottom padding to 20 pixels. Following that, we set the heading text to be the same color as the HTML background color. Finally, applies a shadow to the text content of the element. Its four values are:\n• The first pixel value sets the horizontal offset of the shadow from the text: how far it moves across.\n• The second pixel value sets the vertical offset of the shadow from the text: how far it moves down.\n• The third pixel value sets the blur radius of the shadow. A larger value produces a more fuzzy-looking shadow.\n• The fourth value sets the base color of the shadow. Try experimenting with different values to see how it changes the appearance.\n\nNext, we center the image to make it look better. We could use the same trick as we did for the body. But there are differences that require an additional setting to make the CSS work. The is a block element, meaning it takes up space on the page. The margin applied to a block element will be respected by other elements on the page. In contrast, images are inline elements; for the auto margin trick to work on this image, we must give it block-level behavior using . Finally, we include to make sure that, if the image is larger than the set on the body (600 pixels), it will be displayed at this width, and no bigger. Note: Don't be too concerned if you don't completely understand and the differences between a block element and an inline element, or . They will make more sense as you continue your study of CSS. You can find more information about these properties on MDN's and reference pages."

        "document": "Save and categorize content based on your preferences.\n\nWhen you built your website, you likely created it with your users in mind, trying to make it easy for them to find and explore your content. One of those users is a search engine, which helps people discover your content. SEO—short for search engine optimization—is about helping search engines understand your content, and helping users find your site and make a decision about whether they should visit your site through a search engine.\n\nThe Search Essentials outline the most important elements of what makes your website eligible to appear on Google Search. While there's no guarantee that any particular site will be added to Google's index, sites that follow the Search Essentials are more likely to show up in Google's search results. SEO is about taking the next step and working on improving your site's presence in Search. This guide will walk you through some of the most common and effective improvements you can do on your site.\n\nThere are no secrets here that'll automatically rank your site first in Google (sorry!). In fact some of the suggestions might not even apply to your business, but following the best practices will hopefully make it easier for search engines (not just Google) to crawl, index, and understand your content.\n\nGoogle is a fully automated search engine that uses programs called crawlers to explore the web constantly, looking for pages to add to our index. You usually don't need to do anything except publish your site on the web. In fact, the vast majority of sites listed in our results are found and added automatically as we crawl the web. If you're hungry for more, we have documentation about how Google discovers, crawls, and serves web pages.\n\nHow long until I see impact in search results?\n\nEvery change you make will take some time to be reflected on Google's end. Some changes might take effect in a few hours, others could take several months. In general, you likely want to wait a few weeks to assess whether your work had beneficial effects in Google Search results. Keep in mind that not all changes you make to your website will result in noticeable impact in search results; if you're not satisfied with your results and your business strategies allow it, try iterating with the changes and see if they make a difference.\n\nBefore you actually do anything mentioned in this section, check if Google has already found your content (maybe you don't need to do anything!). Try searching on Google for your site with the . If you see results pointing to your site, you're in the index. For example, a search for returns these results. If you don't see your site, check out the technical requirements to make sure there's nothing technically preventing your site from showing in Google Search, and then come back here.\n\nGoogle primarily finds pages through links from other pages it already crawled. In many cases, these are other websites that are linking to your pages. Other sites linking to you is something that happens naturally over time, and you can also encourage people to discover your content by promoting your site.\n\nIf you're open to a little technical challenge, you could also submit a sitemap—which is a file that contains all the URLs on your site that you care about. Some content management systems (CMS) may even do this automatically for you. However this isn't required, and you should first focus on making sure people know about your site.\n\nCheck if Google can see your page the same way a user does\n\nWhen Google crawls a page, it should ideally see the page the same way an average user does. For this, Google needs to be able to access the same resources as the user's browser. If your site is hiding important components that make up your website (like CSS and JavaScript), Google might not be able to understand your pages, which means they might not show up in search results or rank well for the terms you're targeting.\n\nIf your pages have different information depending on the user's physical location, make sure you're satisfied with the information that Google sees from its crawler's location, which is generally the US.\n\nTo check how Google sees your page, use the URL Inspection Tool in Search Console.\n\nIt might be important for you to opt out your site as a whole or sections of it from appearing in search results. For example, you might not want your posts about your new embarrassing haircut to show up in search results. Google supports various ways that lets you opt out of crawling and indexing of your URLs. If you need to block some files, directories, or even your whole site from Google Search, check out our guide about ways to prevent content from appearing in search results.\n\nWhen you're setting up or redoing your site, it can be good to organize it in a logical way because it can help search engines and users understand how your pages relate to the rest of your site. Don't drop everything and start reorganizing your site right now though: while these suggestions can be helpful long term (especially if you're working on a larger website), search engines will likely understand your pages as they are right now, regardless of how your site is organized.\n\nParts of the URL can be displayed in search results as breadcrumbs, so users can also use the URLs to understand whether a result will be useful for them.\n\nGoogle learns breadcrumbs automatically based on the words in the URL, but you can also influence them with structured data if you like a technical challenge. Try to include words in the URL that may be useful for users; for example:\n\nA URL that only contains random identifiers is less helpful for users; for example:\n\nIf you have more than a few thousand URLs on your site, how you organize your content may have effects on how Google crawls and indexes your site. Specifically, using directories (or folders) to group similar topics can help Google learn how often the URLs in individual directories change.\n\nFor example, consider the following URLs:\n\nThe content in the directory seldomly changes, however the content in the directory likely changes very often. Google can learn this information and crawl the different directories at different frequencies. To learn more about search-friendly site structures, check out our guide for ecommerce sites, for which a good URL structure is more important as they tend to be larger.\n\nSome websites show the same content under different URLs, which is called duplicate content. Search engines choose a single URL (the canonical URL) to show users, per piece of content.\n\nHaving duplicate content on your site is not a violation of our spam policies, but it can be a bad user experience and search engines might waste crawling resources on URLs that you don't even care about. If you're feeling adventurous, it's worth figuring out if you can specify a canonical version for your pages. But if you don't canonicalize your URLs yourself, Google will try to automatically do it for you.\n\nWhen working on canonicalization, try to ensure that each piece of content on your site is only accessible through one individual URL; having two pages that contain the same information about your promotions can be a confusing user experience (for example, people might wonder which is the right page, and whether there's a difference between the two).\n\nIf you have multiple pages that have the same information, try setting up a redirect from non-preferred URLs to a URL that best represents that information. If you can't redirect, use the element instead. But again, don't worry too much about this; search engines can generally figure this out for you on their own most of the time.\n\nMake your site interesting and useful\n\nCreating content that people find compelling and useful will likely influence your website's presence in search results more than any of the other suggestions in this guide. While \"compelling and useful content\" can mean different things to different people, content like this generally shares some common attributes, such as:\n• The text is easy-to-read and well organized: Write content naturally and make sure the content is well written, easy to follow, and free of spelling and grammatical mistakes. Break up long content into paragraphs and sections, and provide headings to help users navigate your pages.\n• The content is unique: When you're writing new content, don't copy others' content in part or in its entirety: create the content yourself based on what you know about the topic. Don't just rehash what others already published.\n• The content is up-to-date: Check in on previously published content and update it as needed, or even delete it if it's not relevant anymore.\n• The content is helpful, reliable, and people-first: Be sure that you're writing content that your readers will find helpful and reliable. For example, providing expert or experienced sources can help people understand your articles' expertise.\n\nThink about the words that a user might search for to find a piece of your content. Users who know a lot about the topic might use different keywords in their search queries than someone who is new to the topic. For example, some users might search for \"charcuterie\", while others might search for \"cheese board\". Anticipating these differences in search behavior and writing with your readers in mind could produce positive effects on how your site performs in search results.\n\nHowever, don't worry if you don't anticipate every variation of how someone might seek your content. Google's language matching systems are sophisticated and can understand how your page relates to many queries, even if you don't explicitly use the exact terms in them.\n\nWhile ads are a part of the internet and are meant to be seen by users, don't let them become overly distracting or prevent your users from reading your content. For example, advertisements, or interstitial pages (pages displayed before or after the content you're expecting) that make it difficult to use the website.\n\nLinks are a great way to connect your users and search engines to other parts of your site, or relevant pages on other sites. In fact, the vast majority of the new pages Google finds every day are through links, making links a crucial resource you need to consider to help your pages be discovered by Google and potentially shown in search results. Additionally, links can also add value by connecting users (and Google) to another resource that corroborates what you're writing about.\n\nLink text (also known as anchor text) is the text part of a link that you can see. This text tells users and Google something about the page you're linking to. With appropriate anchor text, users and search engines can easily understand what your linked pages contain before they visit.\n\nLink when you need to\n\nLinks can provide more context on a topic, both for users and search engines, which may help demonstrate your knowledge on a topic. However when you're linking to pages outside of your control, for example content on other sites, make sure you trust the resource you're linking to. If you can't trust the content and you still want to link to them, add a or similar annotation to the link to avoid search engines associating your site with the site you're linking to. This helps avoid potential negative consequences in your rankings in Google Search.\n\nIf you're accepting user-generated content on your site, such as forum posts or comments, make sure every link that's posted by users has a or similar annotation automatically added by your CMS. Since you're not creating the content in this case, you likely don't want your site to be blindly associated with the sites users are linking to. This can also help discourage spammers from abusing your website.\n\nInfluence how your site looks in Google Search\n\nA typical Google Search results page consists of a few different visual elements that you can influence to help users decide whether they should visit your site through those search results. In this section, we're focusing on the title link and the snippet because these are the more visually significant elements.\n\nThe title link is the headline part of the search result and it can help people decide which search result to click. There are a few sources that Google uses to generate this title link, including the words inside the element (also called the title text) and other headings on the page. This title text can also be used for the title that's shown in browsers and bookmarks.\n\nYou can influence the title links in Search by writing good titles: a good title is unique to the page, clear and concise, and accurately describes the contents of the page. For example, your title could include the name of your website or business, other bits of important information like the physical location of the business, and maybe some information about what the particular page has to offer for users. Our documentation about title links has more tips about how to create good titles and how to influence your site's search results' title links.\n\nBelow the title link, a search result typically has a description of the target page to help users decide whether they should click the search result. This is called a snippet.\n\nThe snippet is sourced from the actual content of the page the search result is linking to, thus you have complete control over the words that can be used to generate the snippet. Occasionally the snippet may be sourced from the contents of the meta description tag, which is typically a succinct, one- or two-sentence summary of the page. A good meta description is short, unique to one particular page, and includes the most relevant points of the page. Check out our tips for writing good meta descriptions for more inspiration.\n\nAdd images to your site, and optimize them\n\nMany people search visually, and images can be how people find your website for the first time. For example, if you have a recipe blog, people might find your content by searching for \"fruit tart recipes\" and browsing photos of various types of fruit tarts.\n\nAs you add images to your site, make sure that people and search engines can find and understand them.\n\nWhen you use high quality images, you give users enough context and detail to decide which image best matches what they were looking for. For example, if people are looking for \"daisies\" and come across a rogue edelweiss in search results, a higher quality image would help them distinguish the type of flower.\n\nUse images that are sharp and clear, and place them near text that's relevant to the image. The text that's near images can help Google better understand what the image is about and what it means in context to your page.\n\nFor example, if the page is reviewing yarn shops in London, then it would make sense to embed one of your photos of the yarn shop in the section that details the location, description, and review information for that yarn shop. This helps Google and users associate the image with text that provides more context to what the page is about.\n\nAlt text is a short, but descriptive piece of text that explains the relationship between the image and your content. It helps search engines understand what your image is about and the context of how your image relates to your page, so writing good alt text is quite important. You can add this to your HTML with the attribute of the element, or your CMS may have an easy way to specify a description for an image when you're uploading it to your site. Learn more about how to write good alt text, and how to add it to your images.\n\nIf your website includes pages that are primarily about individual videos, people may also be able to discover your site through video results in Google Search. Many of the best practices for images and text also apply to videos:\n• Create high-quality video content, and embed the video on a standalone page, near text that's relevant to that video.\n• Write descriptive text in the titles and description fields of a video (the title of a video is still a title, and so you can apply the best practices for writing titles here too).\n\nIf your site is particularly video-focused, then continue reading about more things you can do to optimize your videos for search engines.\n\nEffectively promoting your new content will lead to faster discovery by those who are interested in the same subject, and also by search engines. You can do this in many ways:\n• Word of mouth, and many other methods\n\nOne of the most effective and lasting ways is word of mouth: that is, people familiar with your site tell their friends about it, who in turn visit your site. This can take time, and usually you need to invest some time and effort in other practices first, such as community engagement. Our friends over at Google for Creators have excellent resources about building and engaging your audience.\n\nPutting effort into the offline promotion of your company or site can also be rewarding. For example, if you have a business site, make sure its URL is listed on your business cards, letterhead, posters, and other materials. With their permission, you could also send out recurring newsletters to your audience letting them know about new content on your website.\n\nAs with everything in life, you can overdo promoting your site and actually harm it: people may get fatigued of your promotions, and search engines may perceive some of the practices as manipulation of search results.\n\nThings we believe you shouldn't focus on\n\nAs SEO has evolved, so have the ideas and practices (and at times, misconceptions) related to it. What was considered best practice or top priority in the past may no longer be relevant or effective due to the way search engines (and the internet) have developed over time.\n\nTo help you focus on the things that are actually important when it comes to SEO, we collected some of the most common and prominent topics we've seen circulating the internet. In general, our message on these topics is that you should do what's best for your business area; we will elaborate on a few specific points here:\n\nExcessively repeating the same words over and over (even in variations) is tiring for users, and keyword stuffing is against Google's spam policies. Keywords in the domain name or URL path When picking the name of your site, do what's best for your business. Users will use this name to find you, so we recommend following general marketing best practices. From a ranking perspective, the keywords in the name of the domain (or URL path) alone have hardly any effect beyond appearing in breadcrumbs. And while still on the topic of domain names: the TLD (the domain name ending like \".com\" or \".guru\") only matters if you're targeting a specific country's users, and even then it's usually a low impact signal. For example, if you're trying to sell Dutch cheese to people searching from Switzerland, it makes some sense (both from business and SEO point of view) to use a .ch domain name. Otherwise Google Search doesn't care which TLD you're using (whether it's a .com or .org or .asia). The length of the content alone doesn't matter for ranking purposes (there's no magical word count target, minimum or maximum, though you probably want to have at least one word). If you are varying the words (writing naturally to not be repetitive), you have more chances to show up in Search simply because you are using more keywords. From a business point of view, do whatever makes sense for your business. For example, it might be easier to manage the site if it's segmented by subdirectories, but other times it might make sense to partition topics into subdomains, depending on your site's topic or industry. While PageRank uses links and is one of the fundamental algorithms at Google, there's much more to Google Search than just links. We have many ranking signals, and PageRank is just one of those. If you have some content that's accessible under multiple URLs, it's fine; don't fret about it. It's inefficient, but it's not something that will cause a manual action. Copying others' content, however, is a different story. Having your headings in semantic order is fantastic for screen readers, but from Google Search perspective, it doesn't matter if you're using them out of order. The web in general is not valid HTML, so Google Search can rarely depend on semantic meanings hidden in the HTML specification. There's also no magical, ideal amount of headings a given page should have. However, if you think it's too much, then it probably is. No, it's not.\n• Get started with Search Console: Setting up a Search Console account helps you monitor and optimize how your website performs on Google Search. Learn how to set up your account and what reports to check out first.\n• Maintain your website's SEO over time: Learn more about managing your site's presence in the long term, including more in-depth SEO tasks and scenarios, such as preparing for a site move, or managing a multi-lingual site.\n• Enhance how your site looks in Google Search results: Valid structured data on your pages also makes your pages eligible for many special features in Google Search results, including review stars, carousels, and more. Explore the gallery of search result types that your page can be eligible for.\n\nAs you embark on your SEO journey, here are some resources that can help you stay on top of changes and new resources we publish:"

        "document": "Website performance is crucial for user experience, search engine rankings, and overall success. HTML5 provides a range of features and techniques that can help optimize your website’s performance. This article will guide you through the best practices for HTML5 performance optimization, ensuring your website is fast, efficient, and user-friendly.\n\nStart by ensuring your HTML is clean and semantic. Use appropriate tags like , , , and to structure your content logically.\n\nThis not only improves readability but also enhances accessibility and SEO.\n\nReducing the number of HTTP requests can significantly improve your website’s load time. Combine CSS and JavaScript files, use CSS sprites for images, and leverage inline SVGs where appropriate.\n\nImages are often the largest assets on a web page. Optimize images by using the correct format, compressing them, and implementing responsive images with the element and attribute.\n\nLazy loading defers the loading of images until they are needed. This can significantly improve initial page load times, especially for image-heavy websites.\n\nExample: Lazy Loading with the Attribute\n\nMinifying CSS and JavaScript files reduces their size by removing whitespace, comments, and unnecessary characters. This can significantly reduce load times.\n\nLoading JavaScript asynchronously prevents it from blocking the rendering of the page. Use the or attributes to load scripts asynchronously.\n\nRemoving unused CSS can significantly reduce the size of your CSS files, improving load times. Tools like PurifyCSS and UnCSS can help identify and remove unused styles.\n\nWhenever possible, use CSS for animations instead of JavaScript. CSS animations are typically more performant and can take advantage of hardware acceleration.\n\nMinimize the use of JavaScript, especially in critical rendering paths. Avoid long-running scripts and use techniques like debouncing and throttling to optimize performance.\n\nWeb fonts can significantly impact performance. Limit the number of font families and weights you use. Prefer system fonts where possible.\n\nThe property can control how fonts are displayed while they are loading. Use to ensure text remains visible during font loading.\n\nPreloading critical fonts can improve performance by loading the fonts sooner in the page load process.\n\nA CDN can significantly reduce load times by distributing your content across multiple servers worldwide. This ensures that users load resources from the server closest to them.\n\nEnable Gzip or Brotli compression on your server to reduce the size of your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. This can lead to significant performance improvements.\n\nUse caching headers to instruct browsers to cache static resources, reducing the number of HTTP requests and improving load times for returning visitors.\n\nCritical CSS is the CSS required to render above-the-fold content. By prioritizing this CSS, you can ensure that the content visible to the user loads quickly. This technique involves inlining critical CSS directly in the HTML document and deferring non-critical CSS.\n\nRender-blocking resources, such as CSS and JavaScript files, can delay the rendering of your page. Minimize these resources by deferring or asynchronously loading scripts and inlining critical CSS.\n\nPrefetching resources and preconnecting to required origins can help speed up page load times by initiating requests for critical resources early in the page load process.\n\nUse modern image formats like WebP, which provide superior compression compared to traditional formats like JPEG and PNG. Additionally, use adaptive streaming for videos to deliver optimal quality based on the user’s network conditions.\n\nService workers are scripts that run in the background and can cache resources, intercept network requests, and enable offline functionality. They significantly improve performance by reducing the need for repeated network requests.\n\nHTTP/2 offers performance improvements over HTTP/1.1 by allowing multiple requests and responses to be multiplexed over a single connection. This reduces latency and improves page load times.\n\nEach redirect adds an additional HTTP request-response cycle, which can significantly slow down your website. Ensure that URLs are clean and avoid unnecessary redirects.\n\nA slow server response time can bottleneck your website’s performance. Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights to identify server performance issues and optimize your server settings.\n\nKeep-Alive allows the same TCP connection to remain open for multiple requests and responses between the client and the server. This reduces the overhead of establishing new connections.\n\nEnsure that your website is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes and orientations. Use media queries to apply different styles based on the device’s characteristics.\n\nOptimize your website for touch interactions by ensuring that touch targets are large enough and adequately spaced. This enhances the usability of your site on mobile devices.\n\nAMP is an open-source framework that allows you to create web pages that load quickly on mobile devices. By adhering to AMP’s strict guidelines, you can ensure fast load times and improved user experience.\n\nUse performance monitoring tools like Google Lighthouse, WebPageTest, and Chrome DevTools to continuously monitor and analyze your website’s performance.\n\nThese tools provide insights and recommendations to help you optimize your site.\n\nWebAssembly (Wasm) allows you to run low-level binary code directly in the browser. It’s particularly useful for performance-intensive tasks, as it can execute code faster than JavaScript.\n\nWebAssembly is ideal for applications that require heavy computation, such as games, image processing, and scientific simulations.\n\nPWAs combine the best features of web and mobile apps, providing a fast, reliable, and engaging experience. Implementing a PWA can significantly improve performance by enabling offline functionality, faster load times, and push notifications.\n\nServer-Side Rendering (SSR) involves rendering web pages on the server instead of the client. SSR can improve performance by reducing the time to first meaningful paint and enhancing SEO.\n\nCode splitting involves breaking your JavaScript code into smaller chunks, which are loaded on demand. This reduces the initial load time and ensures that only the necessary code is loaded.\n\nWeb Workers allow you to run JavaScript code in the background, separate from the main thread. This can improve performance by preventing long-running scripts from blocking the UI.\n\nResource hints, such as , , , and , can help browsers make informed decisions about resource loading, improving overall performance.\n\nThe Intersection Observer API allows you to observe changes in the visibility of a target element. This can be useful for lazy loading images, triggering animations, or loading content only when it enters the viewport, thereby improving performance.\n\nThe Performance API provides methods and properties to measure and analyze the performance of web applications. You can use this API to gather data on page load times, resource fetch timings, and other performance metrics.\n\nA Content Security Policy (CSP) can help prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and other attacks by specifying which sources of content are trusted. Implementing CSP can improve security and performance by reducing the risk of malicious scripts.\n\nHTTP/3, the latest version of the HTTP protocol, offers improvements over HTTP/2, including faster connection setup and improved performance. Adopting HTTP/3 can further enhance the performance of your web applications.\n\nJamstack (JavaScript, APIs, and Markup) is a modern web development architecture that decouples the front end from the backend, resulting in faster, more secure, and easier-to-scale applications. By pre-rendering static assets and using APIs for dynamic content, you can significantly improve performance.\n\nPrefetching and prerendering allow browsers to load resources or even entire pages before the user navigates to them, improving perceived performance and reducing load times.\n\nClient-side caching involves storing resources in the browser so that they can be quickly retrieved on subsequent visits without needing to fetch them from the server again.\n\nEnsuring your website is accessible improves the user experience for everyone, including users with disabilities. Use semantic HTML5 elements, ARIA roles, and attributes to enhance accessibility.\n\nWebSockets provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single, long-lived connection. This is particularly useful for real-time applications such as chat apps, live notifications, and collaborative tools, where performance and responsiveness are crucial.\n\nIndexedDB is a low-level API for storing large amounts of structured data on the client side. It’s useful for offline applications, caching data locally, and providing a better user experience by reducing the need for network requests.\n\nThe Canvas API allows you to draw graphics directly in the browser using JavaScript. It’s useful for creating games, data visualizations, and other graphics-intensive applications.\n\nThe Fetch API provides a modern way to make network requests. It supports promises, making it easier to work with asynchronous requests, and allows you to efficiently handle network operations.\n\nThe Web Storage API provides mechanisms for storing key-value pairs in the browser. It includes localStorage for long-term storage and sessionStorage for temporary storage.\n\nThis can help reduce server load and improve performance by caching data locally.\n\nOffscreenCanvas allows you to perform canvas rendering in a web worker, freeing up the main thread and improving performance for graphics-intensive applications.\n\nReal User Monitoring (RUM) collects data from actual user interactions with your website, providing insights into performance from the user’s perspective. Tools like New Relic, Google Analytics, and others offer RUM capabilities.\n\nConduct regular performance audits using tools like Google Lighthouse, WebPageTest, and Chrome DevTools. These audits help identify performance bottlenecks and provide actionable recommendations for optimization.\n\nIntegrate performance testing into your CI/CD pipeline using tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitHub Actions. Automating these tests ensures that performance remains a priority throughout the development lifecycle.\n\nRegularly update your dependencies to benefit from performance improvements and security patches. Use tools like npm-check-updates to manage updates for npm packages.\n\nThe web performance landscape is constantly evolving. Stay informed by following industry blogs, attending webinars, and participating in developer communities.\n\nWebsites like web.dev and resources from the W3C provide valuable insights and updates.\n\nA large and complex DOM can slow down page rendering and interactivity. Keep the DOM as small and shallow as possible by minimizing the number of elements and reducing nesting.\n\nFrequent event triggers, such as scroll or resize events, can negatively impact performance. Debouncing and throttling are techniques that limit the number of times an event handler is called.\n\nAvoid using complex CSS selectors and excessive CSS rules. Keep your CSS concise and specific to improve rendering performance.\n\nMinimize the number of network requests and the amount of data transferred by using techniques such as bundling, minification, and compression.\n\nBrotli is a modern compression algorithm that provides better compression rates than Gzip.\n\nLong tasks can block the main thread, causing the page to become unresponsive. Break up long-running tasks into smaller chunks to keep the main thread responsive.\n\nPrefer CSS animations and transitions over JavaScript animations for better performance. Use the property to hint to the browser about which elements will be animated.\n\nReflows and repaints are expensive operations that can slow down your page. Minimize them by making changes to the DOM in batches and avoiding layout thrashing.\n\nRegularly use browser DevTools to monitor and analyze performance. Pay attention to the Performance, Network, and Lighthouse tabs for insights and optimization suggestions.\n\nHTML5 performance optimization involves a strategic approach to enhance the speed, efficiency, and responsiveness of web applications. By implementing best practices such as reducing DOM size, optimizing CSS and JavaScript, leveraging modern APIs, and using advanced techniques like lazy loading and service workers, you can significantly improve your website’s performance.\n\nContinuously monitor and analyze your site’s performance using tools like Google Lighthouse and Chrome DevTools.
