        "document": "It is tied in with composing a program in python of an electronic store that offers electronic machines like phone, laptop and HDD etc.\n\nThe primary motivation behind composing this coursework is to build up a program in python, utilizing loop concept as well as file read and write for the given scenario of an electronic store. It ought to likewise module algorithm, pseudocode, flowchart and data structure of the program.\n\nThe issue offered was to build up an application which read the text document and show the data accessible. After that the program should to create a invoice for a customer or consumer, with each purchase of the given item. Likewise, after each purchase of some products the stock should be refreshed in same text file.\n\nThe fundamental focus of this coursework is to take in the idea of programming in python and can compose a program for the given command. Similarly, another target of this coursework is learning the concept of file read and write in python programming language and know almost data structure in python. To achieve this aim will be made to finish all the work in the given time frame. Additionally, more research and study relating with this errand will be made.\n\nTo solve all the given work in this coursework, certain methodologies will be made which are follows.\n• At the primary, study and research will be done to take care of the issue of building up a program and its related point.\n• Then a program will be made in python which will coordinate the given instruction.\n• Data structures required for composing the program will be chosen according to requirement of the given instruction of program.\n• An algorithm of the program will be built where everything the program wills be considered.\n• A flowchart will be drawn to indicate how a code execute and work in the program. It is easy to understand how our program work in the real time.\n• Pseudocode will be made to demonstrate the normal understanding way of the program. It is look like a program but actual it is concept of program it does not execute. Pseudocode is just English language but structure is program.\n• Finally, testing will be improved the situation the composed program so error and bugs will be settled and it can convey the right wanted outcome. This task will be useful for understudies, programmer, software engineers, analysts and particularly for those students who look for premium and need to learn python programming dialect. As well as it is useful for those commercials propose which is required billing system store for individual customer. Adjacent to PC, no an equipment is required however in programming we utilize python IDLE which ought to be installed in computer. This undertaking outlines the thoughts and techniques for composing programs in pythons utilizing loop concept. It additionally comprises algorithm, pseudocode, flowchart and data structure of the program. therefore, this undertaking will be extremely useful for every one of those understudies, programmer, software engineers and python learner students to discover how the code execute and work in the program. Similarly, It will instruct the strategy of different data structure which has been utilized as a part of the program. At last, as the program is composed with great clarification in each progression so it will help every one of those students who discover trouble in python.\n\nThe features of this program as follows;\n• To build a program which work in loop statement and show accessible items which are stored in text file. The program should wait for user to enter purchase details of interest. Program should not close or stop until and unless the user chooses to do as such.\n• Program had user interacts features which is request every question with customer and react that answer provide by customer.\n• Program had exception handling feature which is used when unexpected entered from user. Like, program expect to the integer value from customer but customer entered a string value then program request for integer value. 4.Interconnect the different module in main module for easy to run the full program. Like, read, write, and purchase module are connect with main module.\n• Program can read text file and overwrite or write new text file. In this program, I used products.txt file for store a data and read and overwrite on it.\n• Similarly, program create a unique invoice in text file format and its naming from current device date and time.\n\nThis program was developed by using python official IDLE as name ‘Python IDLE’. In the overall program, I create a four-different module ‘read’, ‘write’, ‘purchase’ are connected to ‘main module’. All module has own work and finally main module call value and instruction from remaining three modules. In the processing of the program I used text file for read data and work on it. After the coding part of the program we construct the flowchart for easier to understand how the program works. Flowchart is the graphical representation of the program, I construct the flowchart using Microsoft Visio 2010, alternatively I used the online tool which link is ‘draw.io’\n• Step 3: txt file is displayed in the screen with products available.\n• Step 6: If product name is correct then go to next step or else remain in same step until valid name is provided.\n• Step 8: If the input number of quantity is available then go to next step or else display Sorry!! a_name !, product is out of stock. We will add stock of product later. Lets hope, you will get this product after next shopping\n• Step 9: Ask customer do you want buy more products?(Y/N) If they select Y, go back to step 6, If they select no, then it won’t go to any steps.\n• Step10: Price of the product with total amount is displayed.\n• Step 11: The percentage to be discounted is asked.\n• Step 12: Total price after the discount is calculated and display updated amount.\n• Step 13: Invoice is printed with customer name, date and time purchase. Products details, Grand total and at last Thank You customer for your shopping. See you again!\n• Step 14: If more customers are there to purchase item ‘Y’ should be clicked and go to step or else end.\n\nLets hope, you will get this product after next shopping. \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \") for i in range(len(L)): end while output (\" \\ \\ You Choosed Items and it's Quantity respectively: \"You did not got your expected \" Because, your totel purchase is not meet the minimum criteria for \" \"You got basic 5% discount and discounted amount is:\" \"You did not got your expected \" Because, your totel purchase is not meet the minimum criteria for \" \"You got basic 10% discount and discounted amount is:\" #unique file name open it on writing mode #In this loop, write in a file only those product which is purchase by user.\n\nA data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a program, and it can be modified and accessed easily later. Basically, data structures have two types one is primitive data types like, integer, float, string. And another is collection data types like, list, tuples, dictionary etc. But this program the following data structure which has been used; list, dictionaries, string, integer and float.\n\nIn this program, I used some primitive data types, which are as follows with description.\n\nInteger represent the whole number and integer is denoted by ‘int’ in program. In this program integers are used for many purpose, like, in the purchase module ask the quantity of product with customer and there except integer value from customer. Similarly, for calculate the quantity stock of product also used integer value.\n\nFloat represent the decimal number and float is denoted by ‘float’ in program. In this program float are used some special calculation like, when customer except some discount percentage from store then there will be calculated in float and final customer payable amount also calculate in float data types.\n\nString represent or carry the alphabet value and in the program, it is initialized by ‘str’.in this program strings are used mainly file write process because text file is not support integer, float or any data types except string. When creating an invoice or update a stock of store there will need to be convert any data into string.\n\nIn this program, I used some collection data types, which are as follows with description.\n\nList is the mostly used collection data types it is an ordered sequence of items where it consists different data types. List are mutable data types it has modified easily after assign. In this program, I used list in ‘read’ module for storing a data from given text file. And there is another module ‘purchase’ where I used a list for calling the value form ‘read’ module. Similarly, in the ‘write’ module I also used same list for the update stock of store after each purchase.\n\nDictionaries are unordered collection data types where it consists various data types. It has different indexing style like, key and value, where key represent the cross-ponding value. In this program, I used a dictionary in ‘purchase’ module for add every product customer want to buy and display after chosen. In the ‘write’ module for updating a stock of product after each purchase.\n\nThis python program creating an invoice after every purchase an it can update inventory stock after each purchase. In the time when I was doing this program, many problems were created but after continuity of research and with help of our module leader and instructor, that problems were done as a solution. This is a modular programming method. This programming is done by creating a different module into functions and files. This helps to understand the program and easy to accessible. For this program, I divided four different module which are as follows;\n• read.py: in this read module, read_file function works on file as read mode and it creates an empty list. In that empty list, stored data from text file which have some data of store.\n• purchase.py: In this module, it brings a list from read module. And ask the question for what product do want to purchase customer. Similarly, ask for quantity for that product. When user entered value are matched in the list and execute the calculation for choose product. After than ask the discount percentage, when these all operation done then purchase module act on invoice. Finally, it creates a unique invoice for purchase.\n• write.py: In this module, after each purchase it collect data from purchase and update in stock file(products.txt). for example, customer purchase 10 laptop out of 50 then update stock file will must be remaining 40 laptops only.\n• Main.py: This module collects all information and data from remaining three modules and execute from here.\n\nTesting is the technique where we check our program for program gives the expected output or not as well as the program has any error or bugs or not. Now it is complete by black box testing method. And following are demonstrate of black box testing.\n\nThis coursework has helped me to explore more in python programming language. I learnt that python programming is a great degree valuable apparatuses to manufacture and create many projects and programming. The stock administration framework is valuable as it keeps the record of the item in the electronic store and in addition it causes client to screen their buy.\n\nSimilarly, it has helped me to achieve the new level of the imagination and have given me the certainty to grow more projects and to improve my programming abilities and skills as well as to improve my programming understanding level. After a great deal of diligent work and research, at long last calculation and flowchart were made which would give the peruse a basic perception of the program, clear comprehension of the code and how the program is running. After the consummation of the coursework it was important to guarantee that it was bug and mistake free, such a significant number of test were done which affirmed that the projects were prepared to use in the genuine situation and can be refreshed if necessary in future.\n\nFrom the overall coursework, it gives me a knowledge about not only python programming language, flowchart and pseudocode also helps to Java programming language as well. This coursework is quite tough then I expect, In the first week of this coursework I feel it is easy to create a program as a requirement. But , this is hard to finish. Finally, it happens good and program is also done with the help of teachers as well as senior friends.\n\nHence indisputably, the coursework has been an amazing help to learn and get the more information about the python programming language. Moreover, it has helped me in additionally creating distinctive different ability and educated numerous things which will help in my profession life in future. This undertaking has still got spaces for the change. At long last, I foresee accomplishing more undertakings in coming future"

        "document": "The Inventory Management system is used to manage store products and keep track of all goods stock and also we can use it to check the purchases history of the store. Basically, we are developing a system to manage/automate some processes of any retail store by using the computer. So by using this system we can keep record data of products and even all purchases happened in-store.\n\nSo here we are going to develop an inventory management system using python and for storing data we are going to use JSON files. First of all, we will create sample data by using python code itself and then developing all functions one by one.\n\nWe have to open JSON files on each function and loading JSON data in python dictionary format and again reverse the process of converting dictionary data back to JSON format then closing the file.\n\nSo we have created data for our inventory management system now we have to create functions to access this data and process various functionalities on it.\n\nSo for this system, we will add two main parts\n• Admin Level Functionality. (used for Administrator of the system to operate)\n• User Level Functionality. (will be used by Customers)\n\nBasically, This is just for managing the Inventory for a person having extra permissions like inserting, updating, and deleting product details which should be at the owner or manager level only.\n\nFollowing Function will help to coordinate between admin Functions\n\nThis level will provide the following Functions\n\n1. Function To Show All Products In Inventory\n\nIn This Function, Admin Will have two options either he wants all list as it is in Database or else he wants to have a look at all products by their categories.\n\nNote: To make it look good in the tabular format we will use pandas.\n\nIn this Function, Admin will have to enter the Product ID of the product to see the details he wants to check he will get all details regarding that particular product.\n\n3. Insertion Function To Add New Products in Inventory:\n\nThis Function will allow Admin to Add New Product Details in Inventory. Also provides Functionality to add new attribute property for a specific product if Admin wants to add other than basic 5 properties/details.\n\nNote: Here program is more specific regarding data we have inserted we can make changes to make it applicable to all types\n\nHere Admin can remove products that are out of stock or want to delete. Also, it will Throw an Error on an invalid product ID.\n\nThis Function will provide Admin two options either he wants to update all details of the product or he wants to edit any specific detail/attribute of the product. Also, it will Throw an Error on an invalid product ID.\n\nAdmin can have a look at user purchases with two options like either he wants to check all purchase reports or want to check the purchase report of any specific customer/user. This Also Provide Functionality to show a message that no reports are present if no purchase happened by any user. Also, it will Throw an Error on an invalid User ID.\n\nAdmin Can Delete the Whole Database also if he wants to clear it all.\n\nThis is basically something like a customer can operate to buy products and get his bill and previous bills record too have no functionally or access to the product to either insert or modify or delete it.\n\nFollowing Function will help to coordinate between admin Functions\n\nFollowing Are The Functions at User Level\n\nNote: Before the user buys something we should show him a list of all products available in inventory so we can use the same function we have created for admin for displaying products.\n\nThis Function will help the user to track his purchase and all bills reports till today. Also, This Function Provides Information Only to the User if he enters User ID. (we can add password features also here to increase more functionality)\n\nUser/Customer will get his bill regarding purchases done by him just after the purchase with a unique 10 digit Transaction ID. If a user buys multiple products in one go it will give an aggregate bill.\n\nThis is the main function of this part this will allow user/customer to buy products it will give an error if the customer buys a product with high quantity than in stock also user will get one more chance to correct quantity if he wants to save efforts or restarting the process or he can skip that product too. Also, Customer will get messages out of stock if the product is not present in inventory (quantity=0). Customers can buy multiple products simultaneously by using product IDs (we can add buying product by its name also) user/customer will error messages if he enters wrong choices.\n\nAfter all, we have to manage user and admin-level functionalities. So, code for that is,\n\nThis was all complete Inventory Management System with Admin and User Functionalities.\n\nBelow is the full implementation:"

        "document": "How I moved from frustration to freedom I don’t miss corrupt spreadsheets, spreadsheets not opening or formula errors. There’s a real feeling of satisfaction in a well produced model which achieves the end result, but that experience is less fun as a reviewer. Manual recalculations for audit purposes which have to evidenced (and so re-done every time a number changes), multi-tab efforts which require you to become Hercule Poirot to work out where a number is flowing to and why, broken links… For all these reasons, spreadsheets for all their flexibility and power aren’t always the best tool for the job. So what changed? When I learnt programming I found it was even easier to build complex models. There were no linkage issues, formulas are transparent and easy to audit and it was super easy to follow. To give an example, if we have a table with two columns, Sales and Purchases, we can then create a third column called Profit, where Profit = Sales - Purchases The ability to create variables and name them sensibily makes it super easy to follow. If we add tax on profit at 20% we can say: Tax = Profit * 0.2 Profit after tax = Profit - Tax I now have a simple rule. If lots of calculations are to be performed and they have to be right (which is almost always!) I would rather do the calculations in Python. So, we can start off with the basic data in excel (eg sales and purchases) and then add all the extra columns and calculations using Python. These can then be downloaded to excel again if needed but it means that the underlying data is correct. Python is brilliant at linking data, creating weighted phased calculations and building the models is so quick because you only have to write each calculation once, there’s no need to fill down or copy and ensure $ signs are in place. By moving to Python and then adding a database we were able to hugely simplify the process. My Python going concern model for example picked up a number of errors in the excel model and saved me hours of calculation (there were no errors in the Python model) and so for that reason we are moving to use Python wherever possible for year end reporting. The same applies for cash flow analysis. The ability to execute APIs, combine datasets and trigger automation make python a powerful and liberating option.

        "document": "File handling refers to the process of performing operations on a file such as creating, opening, reading, writing and closing it, through a programming interface. It involves managing the data flow between the program and the file system on the storage device, ensuring that data is handled safely and efficiently.\n\nTo open a file we can use function, which requires file path and mode as arguments:\n\nWhen opening a file, we must specify the mode we want to which specifies what we want to do with the file. Here’s a table of the different modes available:\n\nOpens the file for reading. File must exist; otherwise, it raises an error. Opens the file for reading binary data. File must exist; otherwise, it raises an error. Opens the file for both reading and writing. File must exist; otherwise, it raises an error. Opens the file for both reading and writing binary data.

Creates a new binary file for reading and writing. Raises an error if the file exists.\n\nFor this article we are using text file with text:\n\nReading a file can be achieved by file.read() which reads the entire content of the file. After reading the file we can close the file using file.close() which closes the file after reading it, which is necessary to free up system resources.\n\nWriting to a file is done using file.write() which writes the specified string to the file. If the file exists, its content is erased. If it doesn’t exist, a new file is created.\n\nExample: Writing to a File in Write Mode (w)\n\nIt is done using adds the specified string to the end of the file without erasing its existing content.\n\nExample: For this example, we will use the Python file created in the previous example.\n\nClosing a file is essential to ensure that all resources used by the file are properly released. loses the file and ensures that any changes made to the file are saved.\n\nstatement is used for resource management. It ensures that file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised. with open() as method automatically handles closing the file once the block of code is exited, even if an error occurs. This reduces the risk of file corruption and resource leakage.\n\nIt’s important to handle exceptions to ensure that files are closed properly, even if an error occurs during file operations.\n• None Versatility : File handling in Python allows us to perform a wide range of operations, such as creating, reading, writing, appending, renaming and deleting files.\n• Flexibility : File handling in Python is highly flexible, as it allows us to work with different file types (e.g. text files, binary files, CSV files , etc.) and to perform different operations on files (e.g. read, write, append, etc.).\n• User – friendly : Python provides a user-friendly interface for file handling, making it easy to create, read and manipulate files.\n• Cross-platform : Python file-handling functions work across different platforms (e.g. Windows, Mac, Linux), allowing for seamless integration and compatibility.\n• Error-prone: File handling operations in Python can be prone to errors, especially if the code is not carefully written or if there are issues with the file system (e.g. file permissions, file locks, etc.).\n• Security risks : File handling in Python can also pose security risks, especially if the program accepts user input that can be used to access or modify sensitive files on the system.\n• Complexity : File handling in Python can be complex, especially when working with more advanced file formats or operations. Careful attention must be paid to the code to ensure that files are handled properly and securely.\n• Performance : File handling operations in Python can be slower than other programming languages, especially when dealing with large files or performing complex operations.\n\nWhat are the types of files in Python?\n\nWhat are the 4 file handling functions?\n\nWhy is file handling useful?\n\nIn Python file handling, is a method of file objects that returns the current position of the file pointer (cursor) within the file. It returns an integer representing the byte offset from the beginning of the file where the next read or write operation will occur. # Open a file in read mode file = open('example.txt', 'r') # Read the first 10 characters content = file.read(10) print(content) # Check the current position of the file pointer position = file.tell() print(\"Current position:\", position) # Close the file file.close()\n• None reads the first 10 characters from the file.\n• None returns the current position of the file pointer after reading."

In Python, the function allows you to capture user input from the keyboard, while you can use the function to display output to the console.\n\nThese built-in functions allow for basic user interaction in Python scripts, enabling you to gather data and provide feedback. If you want to go beyond the basics, then you can even use them to develop applications that are not only functional but also user-friendly and responsive.\n\nBy the end of this tutorial, you’ll know how to:\n• Take user input from the keyboard with\n• Display output to the console with\n• Use to improve the user experience when collecting input on UNIX-like systems\n• Format output using the and keyword arguments of\n\nTo get the most out of this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of Python syntax and familiarity with using the Python interpreter and running Python scripts.\n\nPrograms often need to obtain data from users, typically through keyboard input. In Python, one way to collect user input from the keyboard is by calling the function: The function pauses program execution to allow you to type in a line of input from the keyboard. Once you press the key, all characters typed are read and returned as a string, excluding the newline character generated by pressing . If you add text in between the parentheses, effectively passing a value to the optional argument, then displays the text you entered as a prompt: \"Please enter your name: \" Please enter your name: John Doe Adding a meaningful prompt will assist your user in understanding what they’re supposed to input, which makes for a better user experience. The function always reads the user’s input as a string. Even if you type characters that resemble numbers, Python will still treat them as a string: File , line , in : can only concatenate str (not \"int\") to str In the example above, you wanted to add to the number entered by the user. However, the expression on line 7 doesn’t work because is a string ( ) and is an integer. In Python, you can’t combine a string and an integer using the plus ( ) operator. You wanted to perform a mathematical operation using two integers, but because always returns a string, you need a way to read user input as a numeric type. So, you’ll need to convert the string to the appropriate type: In this updated code snippet, you use to convert the user input to an integer right after collecting it. Then, you assign the converted value to the name . That way, the calculation has two integers to add. The calculation succeeds and Python returns the correct sum. Note: When you convert user input to a numeric type using functions like in a real-world scenario, it’s crucial to handle potential exceptions to prevent your program from crashing due to invalid input. The function lets you collect information from your users. But once your program has calculated a result, how do you display it back to them? Up to this point, you’ve seen results displayed automatically as output in the interactive Python interpreter session. However, if you ran the same code from a file instead, then Python would still calculate the values, but you wouldn’t see the results. To display output in the console, you can use Python’s function, which lets you show text and data to your users.\n\nIn addition to obtaining data from the user, a program will often need to present data back to the user. In Python, you can display data to the console with the function. To display objects to the console, you pass them as a comma-separated list of arguments to . By default, the output that produces separates objects by a single space and appends a newline to the end of the output: You can specify any type of object as an argument to . If an object isn’t a string, then converts it to an appropriate string representation before displaying it: As you can see, you can display complex types like lists, dictionaries, and even functions to the console with .\n\nCombining Python Input and Output in a Practical Example Now that you know how to read input from users with and display output with , you can combine these tools to create a small two-line program that greets a user by their name. The program will start by prompting the user to enter their name and capture that input using . Then, you can use to output a personalized greeting that includes the entered name: \"Please enter your name: \" The script introduces a small interaction with your user. When the program runs, it temporarily pauses, awaiting input from the user. Once the user provides their name and presses the key, the program immediately responds with a warm greeting: Note that automatically adds spaces between arguments when concatenating multiple arguments into a single string. The small program in collects user input and responds with console output in only two lines of code:\n• Line 1 prompts the user with a helpful message. The function then collects the user’s response as a string, which you assign to the variable.\n• Line 2 assembles a custom greeting using hardcoded strings and the value stored in . The function combines the greeting with the user’s input and displays it to the console. This example brings together the and functions to accomplish a specific purpose, using the strengths of each function:\n• gathers user data, making the program interactive and adaptable to different users.\n• displays feedback based on that data, which allows the program to communicate its response to the user in a friendly, personalized way. In a real-world application, these basic tools can support more complex workflows. For example, after welcoming a user, your program might offer further options or prompt them for more specific input to guide them through a process. Expand the collapsible section below to continue practicing with a slightly more complex example: Create a guess-the-number game where a player only has one shot at getting the right answer. You can use the function from Python’s module to let your program pick a random number: Then, your program should prompt the player to enter a number using . You can then use conditional statements to take different actions, depending on whether the user guessed the correct number or not. Keep in mind that you’ll have to read the user input as an integer in order to successfully compare it to the randomly generated number. Give it a try and write the code for this small game. Once you have a working solution—or if you get really stuck—you can check the example solution in the collapsible section below. If you’ve successfully built the guess-the-number game and you want another challenge, then you can expand the collapsible section below for a second task: Write a text-based adventure game where the player can choose whether to attack or run using . Try to implement a game loop using indefinite iteration and allow your code to take different actions depending on conditional logic. Keep it small and don’t go overboard—unless you really want to, of course! You can check out an example solution for a minimal implementation of this game by expanding the collapsible section following this one. Collecting user input and displaying data back to the user comes in handy in many scenarios. Can you think of another practical use case? If you do, share your thoughts in the comments section below.\n\nIn the previous sections, you explored how the function allows your program to pause and wait for the user to provide information. However, depending on the operating system and shell that you’re working with, the standard may have some limitations that can affect user experience. Note: If you’re on Windows 10 or newer, then you can skip this section. Windows 10 shipped with console improvements that allow for improved keyboard editing and selection. This works natively on Command Prompt and PowerShell. In some configurations, specifically on UNIX-like systems and Windows versions before Windows 10, you’ll notice that you can’t use arrow keys for navigating through typed characters or to recall previously entered commands: This can become cumbersome in interactive programs where users might want to correct mistakes or quickly repeat commands. There’s a straightforward way to improve input functionality just by importing an additional module. The module that you can use depends on whether you’re on a UNIX-like system or on Windows, so make sure to select your operating system from the options below: If you’re on a Windows version above Windows 10, then you don’t need to do anything. Advanced input editing capabilities and history recall are natively supported in Command Prompt and PowerShell since Windows 10. You can try running the code that you’ll see further down without importing the module, and you should still have access to all of the mentioned features. However, if you’re working on a Windows version before Windows 10, then you need to install a third-party library to get access to this functionality. One such library is , which you can install with Python’s package manager, : After the installation is done, the library will provide similar functionality to the GNU Readline library available on UNIX-like systems. While it mimics the behavior of the module from Python’s standard library, is not a direct substitute as it may have differences due to underlying system variations. The file of the third-party project ensures that when you import in your Python code, your code will instead use the implementation. UNIX-like systems, such as macOS and Linux, usually come with the GNU Readline library preinstalled. Python’s module provides an interface to the GNU Readline library, which straightforwardly handles the aforementioned limitations of . Because is part of Python’s standard-library, you don’t even need to install anything. To activate the improved input functionality in your input interface, you only need to import : Try running the code snippet above, which drops you into an infinite loop that allows you to test input editing and history recall:\n• Use the and arrow keys to navigate within the input line.\n• Use and to move to the beginning and end of the input line, respectively.\n• Recall previous inputs using the and arrow keys. You can exit the loop that you set up in and end the example program by typing . Usually, when you call , it calls a lower-level input handling function to wait for user input from the standard input stream. When you import , it overrides the standard input processing by registering handlers for keyboard input. These handlers capture each key press, interpreting special keys like arrows differently. The readline module achieves this seamlessly because instead of changing , it intercepts calls to the lower-level read commands that relies on. When calls these commands, steps in and provides its enhanced behavior. Integrating enhanced input features can significantly improve the user experience, especially in interactive applications like command-line tools or games: This enhancement is particularly valuable in scenarios where users are expected to input commands frequently or make complex entries with frequent edits. It’s important to note that the features provided by and are natively supported only in console environments and may not work in all Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). IDEs often handle input differently from standard terminal environments. Additionally, some key bindings and functionalities may vary depending on the system configuration and the specific implementation of the module. By extending the capabilities of , your programs can offer a more robust and user-friendly interface, accommodating smoother data entry and manipulation processes. In the next section, you’ll continue to explore how you can refine output appearance and formatting using some advanced features of .\n\nThe function takes additional arguments that provide some control over the format of the output. Each of these is a special type of argument called a keyword argument. Keyword arguments have the form . You need to pass them at the end, after the list of objects that you want to display. Note: You can only achieve basic formatting of console output with . If you need more precise control over the appearance of your data, then you can use Python’s f-strings to format the object before passing it to . In this section, you’ll see how the following keyword arguments affect the console output that produces:\n• : This argument allows you to specify how to separate multiple objects when they are printed.\n• : Use this argument to set what Python prints at the end of a call.\n• : This allows you to redirect the output to any file-like object.\n• : Use this argument to flush the output stream, effectively bypassing any buffering. Adding the keyword argument causes Python to separate objects by instead of by the default single space: In these examples, you’ve used different strings, such as , , and to separate the objects that you’re asking to display. You can use the keyword to specify any arbitrary string as the separator: However, passing a string such as as the separator will rarely make a lot of sense. In practice, you’ll probably want to stick with passing a well-readable separator symbol like in the previous examples. To squish objects together without any space between them, you specify an empty string ( ) as the separator: Finally, you can add a linebreak in between each item by passing the newline character ( ) to : Separating objects with a newline character displays each of them on an individual line, which can be helpful when you need to inspect more complex objects. Sometimes, you may even want to separate them with two consecutive newline characters ( ) to group your output better and make it more readable. The keyword argument causes Python to terminate the output by instead of by the default newline: In this example, you’ve replaced the default newline end character with an exclamation mark. Notice how this breaks the usual neat way that calling drops you into a new empty line. Now you get to see an exclamation mark followed directly by Python’s input prompt ( ) because you told not to write a newline character. You can also pass an empty string to this parameter to side-step the default newline functionality. For example, assume that you’re displaying values in a loop: For such small values, you might want to display all values on one line, rather than on individual lines. You can accomplish this with : Note that your prompt slid back up into the output line again because you’re not using a newline as the output terminator. By calling without any arguments just after the loop, you can avoid that, too: When you don’t provide any values to , it outputs a newline character, effectively moving the cursor to the next line. Alternatively, you can achieve the same effect with a bit of logic wrapped in a conditional expression: Just like with , you can use any string as an argument to the keyword, but some strings will make more sense than others as output terminators. The function accepts two additional keyword arguments, and , both of which affect how the function handles the output stream. If you want to learn how to work with these two additional keyword arguments, then you can read the in-depth guide about Python’s function."
