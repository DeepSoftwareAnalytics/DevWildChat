However, beware of using Python’s string operations to assemble queries, as they are vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. For example, an attacker can simply close the single quote and inject to select all rows: # Never do this -- insecure! SELECT * FROM stocks WHERE symbol = '' OR TRUE; --' Instead, use the DB-API’s parameter substitution. To insert a variable into a query string, use a placeholder in the string, and substitute the actual values into the query by providing them as a of values to the second argument of the cursor’s method. An SQL statement may use one of two kinds of placeholders: question marks (qmark style) or named placeholders (named style). For the qmark style, parameters must be a sequence whose length must match the number of placeholders, or a is raised. For the named style, parameters must be an instance of a (or a subclass), which must contain keys for all named parameters; any extra items are ignored. Here’s an example of both styles: # This is the named style used with executemany(): # This is the qmark style used in a SELECT query: PEP 249 numeric placeholders are not supported. If used, they will be interpreted as named placeholders. How to adapt custom Python types to SQLite values¶ SQLite supports only a limited set of data types natively. To store custom Python types in SQLite databases, adapt them to one of the Python types SQLite natively understands. There are two ways to adapt Python objects to SQLite types: letting your object adapt itself, or using an adapter callable. The latter will take precedence above the former. For a library that exports a custom type, it may make sense to enable that type to adapt itself. As an application developer, it may make more sense to take direct control by registering custom adapter functions. Suppose we have a class that represents a pair of coordinates, and , in a Cartesian coordinate system. The coordinate pair will be stored as a text string in the database, using a semicolon to separate the coordinates. This can be implemented by adding a method which returns the adapted value. The object passed to protocol will be of type . The other possibility is to create a function that converts the Python object to an SQLite-compatible type. This function can then be registered using . How to convert SQLite values to custom Python types¶ Writing an adapter lets you convert from custom Python types to SQLite values. To be able to convert from SQLite values to custom Python types, we use converters. Let’s go back to the class. We stored the x and y coordinates separated via semicolons as strings in SQLite. First, we’ll define a converter function that accepts the string as a parameter and constructs a object from it. Converter functions are always passed a object, no matter the underlying SQLite data type. We now need to tell when it should convert a given SQLite value. This is done when connecting to a database, using the detect_types parameter of . There are three options:\n• None Both: set detect_types to . Column names take precedence over declared types. The following example illustrates the implicit and explicit approaches: This section shows recipes for common adapters and converters. How to use connection shortcut methods¶ Using the , , and methods of the class, your code can be written more concisely because you don’t have to create the (often superfluous) objects explicitly. Instead, the objects are created implicitly and these shortcut methods return the cursor objects. This way, you can execute a statement and iterate over it directly using only a single call on the object. # close() is not a shortcut method and it's not called automatically; # the connection object should be closed manually How to use the connection context manager¶ A object can be used as a context manager that automatically commits or rolls back open transactions when leaving the body of the context manager. If the body of the statement finishes without exceptions, the transaction is committed. If this commit fails, or if the body of the statement raises an uncaught exception, the transaction is rolled back. If is , a new transaction is implicitly opened after committing or rolling back. If there is no open transaction upon leaving the body of the statement, or if is , the context manager does nothing. The context manager neither implicitly opens a new transaction nor closes the connection. If you need a closing context manager, consider using . # con.rollback() is called after the with block finishes with an exception, # the exception is still raised and must be caught # Connection object used as context manager only commits or rollbacks transactions, # so the connection object should be closed manually How to work with SQLite URIs¶\n• None Do not implicitly create a new database file if it does not already exist; will raise if unable to create a new file: More information about this feature, including a list of parameters, can be found in the SQLite URI documentation. How to create and use row factories¶ By default, represents each row as a . If a does not suit your needs, you can use the class or a custom . While exists as an attribute both on the and the , it is recommended to set , so all cursors created from the connection will use the same row factory. provides indexed and case-insensitive named access to columns, with minimal memory overhead and performance impact over a . To use as a row factory, assign it to the attribute: \"SELECT 'Earth' AS name, 6378 AS radius\" The clause can be omitted in the statement, as in the above example. In such cases, SQLite returns a single row with columns defined by expressions, e.g. literals, with the given aliases . You can create a custom that returns each row as a , with column names mapped to values: Using it, queries now return a instead of a : can be used as follows: With some adjustments, the above recipe can be adapted to use a , or any other custom class, instead of a . By default, uses to adapt SQLite values with the data type. This works well for UTF-8 encoded text, but it might fail for other encodings and invalid UTF-8. You can use a custom to handle such cases. Because of SQLite’s flexible typing, it is not uncommon to encounter table columns with the data type containing non-UTF-8 encodings, or even arbitrary data. To demonstrate, let’s assume we have a database with ISO-8859-2 (Latin-2) encoded text, for example a table of Czech-English dictionary entries. Assuming we now have a instance connected to this database, we can decode the Latin-2 encoded text using this : For invalid UTF-8 or arbitrary data in stored in table columns, you can use the following technique, borrowed from the Unicode HOWTO: The module API does not support strings containing surrogates."

If a is given, it must contain keys for all named parameters. Any extra items are ignored. Here’s an example of both styles:\n\nString constant stating the supported DB-API level. Required by the DB-API. Hard-coded to . String constant stating the type of parameter marker formatting expected by the module. Required by the DB-API. Hard-coded to . The module supports both and DB-API parameter styles, because that is what the underlying SQLite library supports. However, the DB-API does not allow multiple values for the attribute. The version number of this module, as a string. This is not the version of the SQLite library. The version number of this module, as a tuple of integers. This is not the version of the SQLite library. The version number of the run-time SQLite library, as a string. The version number of the run-time SQLite library, as a tuple of integers. Integer constant required by the DB-API, stating the level of thread safety the module supports. Currently hard-coded to , meaning “Threads may share the module, but not connections.” However, this may not always be true. You can check the underlying SQLite library’s compile-time threaded mode using the following query: Note that the SQLITE_THREADSAFE levels do not match the DB-API 2.0 levels. This constant is meant to be used with the detect_types parameter of the function. Setting it makes the module parse the declared type for each column it returns. It will parse out the first word of the declared type, i. e. for “integer primary key”, it will parse out “integer”, or for “number(10)” it will parse out “number”. Then for that column, it will look into the converters dictionary and use the converter function registered for that type there. This constant is meant to be used with the detect_types parameter of the function. Setting this makes the SQLite interface parse the column name for each column it returns. It will look for a string formed [mytype] in there, and then decide that ‘mytype’ is the type of the column. It will try to find an entry of ‘mytype’ in the converters dictionary and then use the converter function found there to return the value. The column name found in does not include the type, i. e. if you use something like in your SQL, then we will parse out everything until the first for the column name and strip the preceding space: the column name would simply be “Expiration date”. Opens a connection to the SQLite database file database. By default returns a object, unless a custom factory is given. database is a path-like object giving the pathname (absolute or relative to the current working directory) of the database file to be opened. You can use to open a database connection to a database that resides in RAM instead of on disk. When a database is accessed by multiple connections, and one of the processes modifies the database, the SQLite database is locked until that transaction is committed. The timeout parameter specifies how long the connection should wait for the lock to go away until raising an exception. The default for the timeout parameter is 5.0 (five seconds). For the isolation_level parameter, please see the property of objects. SQLite natively supports only the types TEXT, INTEGER, REAL, BLOB and NULL. If you want to use other types you must add support for them yourself. The detect_types parameter and the using custom converters registered with the module-level function allow you to easily do that. detect_types defaults to 0 (i. e. off, no type detection), you can set it to any combination of and to turn type detection on. Due to SQLite behaviour, types can’t be detected for generated fields (for example ), even when detect_types parameter is set. In such case, the returned type is . By default, check_same_thread is and only the creating thread may use the connection. If set , the returned connection may be shared across multiple threads. When using multiple threads with the same connection writing operations should be serialized by the user to avoid data corruption. By default, the module uses its class for the connect call. You can, however, subclass the class and make use your class instead by providing your class for the factory parameter. Consult the section SQLite and Python types of this manual for details. The module internally uses a statement cache to avoid SQL parsing overhead. If you want to explicitly set the number of statements that are cached for the connection, you can set the cached_statements parameter. The currently implemented default is to cache 100 statements. If uri is , database is interpreted as a with a file path and an optional query string. The scheme part must be . The path can be a relative or absolute file path. The query string allows us to pass parameters to SQLite. Some useful URI tricks include: # Don't implicitly create a new database file if it does not already exist. # Will raise sqlite3.OperationalError if unable to open a database file. More information about this feature, including a list of recognized parameters, can be found in the SQLite URI documentation. Changed in version 3.7: database can now also be a path-like object, not only a string. Registers a callable to convert a bytestring from the database into a custom Python type. The callable will be invoked for all database values that are of the type typename. Confer the parameter detect_types of the function for how the type detection works. Note that typename and the name of the type in your query are matched in case-insensitive manner. Registers a callable to convert the custom Python type type into one of SQLite’s supported types. The callable callable accepts as single parameter the Python value, and must return a value of the following types: int, float, str or bytes. Returns if the string sql contains one or more complete SQL statements terminated by semicolons. It does not verify that the SQL is syntactically correct, only that there are no unclosed string literals and the statement is terminated by a semicolon. This can be used to build a shell for SQLite, as in the following example: \"Enter your SQL commands to execute in sqlite3.\" By default you will not get any tracebacks in user-defined functions, aggregates, converters, authorizer callbacks etc. If you want to debug them, you can call this function with flag set to . Afterwards, you will get tracebacks from callbacks on . Use to disable the feature again.\n\nAn SQLite database connection has the following attributes and methods: Get or set the current default isolation level. for autocommit mode or one of “DEFERRED”, “IMMEDIATE” or “EXCLUSIVE”. See section Controlling Transactions for a more detailed explanation. if a transaction is active (there are uncommitted changes), otherwise. Read-only attribute. The cursor method accepts a single optional parameter factory. If supplied, this must be a callable returning an instance of or its subclasses. This method commits the current transaction. If you don’t call this method, anything you did since the last call to is not visible from other database connections. If you wonder why you don’t see the data you’ve written to the database, please check you didn’t forget to call this method. This method rolls back any changes to the database since the last call to . This closes the database connection. Note that this does not automatically call . If you just close your database connection without calling first, your changes will be lost! Create a new object and call on it with the given sql and parameters. Return the new cursor object. Create a new object and call on it with the given sql and parameters. Return the new cursor object. Create a new object and call on it with the given sql_script. Return the new cursor object. Creates a user-defined function that you can later use from within SQL statements under the function name name. num_params is the number of parameters the function accepts (if num_params is -1, the function may take any number of arguments), and func is a Python callable that is called as the SQL function. If deterministic is true, the created function is marked as deterministic, which allows SQLite to perform additional optimizations. This flag is supported by SQLite 3.8.3 or higher, will be raised if used with older versions. The function can return any of the types supported by SQLite: bytes, str, int, float and . Changed in version 3.8: The deterministic parameter was added. The aggregate class must implement a method, which accepts the number of parameters num_params (if num_params is -1, the function may take any number of arguments), and a method which will return the final result of the aggregate. The method can return any of the types supported by SQLite: bytes, str, int, float and . Creates a collation with the specified name and callable. The callable will be passed two string arguments. It should return -1 if the first is ordered lower than the second, 0 if they are ordered equal and 1 if the first is ordered higher than the second. Note that this controls sorting (ORDER BY in SQL) so your comparisons don’t affect other SQL operations. Note that the callable will get its parameters as Python bytestrings, which will normally be encoded in UTF-8. The following example shows a custom collation that sorts “the wrong way”: To remove a collation, call with as callable: You can call this method from a different thread to abort any queries that might be executing on the connection. The query will then abort and the caller will get an exception. This routine registers a callback. The callback is invoked for each attempt to access a column of a table in the database. The callback should return if access is allowed, if the entire SQL statement should be aborted with an error and if the column should be treated as a NULL value. These constants are available in the module. The first argument to the callback signifies what kind of operation is to be authorized. The second and third argument will be arguments or depending on the first argument. The 4th argument is the name of the database (“main”, “temp”, etc.) if applicable. The 5th argument is the name of the inner-most trigger or view that is responsible for the access attempt or if this access attempt is directly from input SQL code. Please consult the SQLite documentation about the possible values for the first argument and the meaning of the second and third argument depending on the first one. All necessary constants are available in the module. This routine registers a callback. The callback is invoked for every n instructions of the SQLite virtual machine. This is useful if you want to get called from SQLite during long-running operations, for example to update a GUI. If you want to clear any previously installed progress handler, call the method with for handler. Returning a non-zero value from the handler function will terminate the currently executing query and cause it to raise an exception. Registers trace_callback to be called for each SQL statement that is actually executed by the SQLite backend. The only argument passed to the callback is the statement (as ) that is being executed. The return value of the callback is ignored. Note that the backend does not only run statements passed to the methods. Other sources include the transaction management of the sqlite3 module and the execution of triggers defined in the current database. Passing as trace_callback will disable the trace callback. Exceptions raised in the trace callback are not propagated. As a development and debugging aid, use to enable printing tracebacks from exceptions raised in the trace callback. This routine allows/disallows the SQLite engine to load SQLite extensions from shared libraries. SQLite extensions can define new functions, aggregates or whole new virtual table implementations. One well-known extension is the fulltext-search extension distributed with SQLite. Loadable extensions are disabled by default. See . # alternatively you can load the extension using an API call: \"select rowid, name, ingredients from recipe where name match 'pie'\" This routine loads an SQLite extension from a shared library. You have to enable extension loading with before you can use this routine. Loadable extensions are disabled by default. See . You can change this attribute to a callable that accepts the cursor and the original row as a tuple and will return the real result row. This way, you can implement more advanced ways of returning results, such as returning an object that can also access columns by name. If returning a tuple doesn’t suffice and you want name-based access to columns, you should consider setting to the highly-optimized type. provides both index-based and case-insensitive name-based access to columns with almost no memory overhead. It will probably be better than your own custom dictionary-based approach or even a db_row based solution. Using this attribute you can control what objects are returned for the data type. By default, this attribute is set to and the module will return objects for . If you want to return instead, you can set it to . You can also set it to any other callable that accepts a single bytestring parameter and returns the resulting object. See the following example code for illustration: # by default, rows are returned as str # but we can make sqlite3 always return bytestrings ... # the bytestrings will be encoded in UTF-8, unless you stored garbage in the # we can also implement a custom text_factory ... # here we implement one that appends \"foo\" to all strings Returns the total number of database rows that have been modified, inserted, or deleted since the database connection was opened. Returns an iterator to dump the database in an SQL text format. Useful when saving an in-memory database for later restoration. This function provides the same capabilities as the command in the sqlite3 shell. This method makes a backup of an SQLite database even while it’s being accessed by other clients, or concurrently by the same connection. The copy will be written into the mandatory argument target, that must be another instance. By default, or when pages is either or a negative integer, the entire database is copied in a single step; otherwise the method performs a loop copying up to pages pages at a time. If progress is specified, it must either be or a callable object that will be executed at each iteration with three integer arguments, respectively the status of the last iteration, the remaining number of pages still to be copied and the total number of pages. The name argument specifies the database name that will be copied: it must be a string containing either , the default, to indicate the main database, to indicate the temporary database or the name specified after the keyword in an statement for an attached database. The sleep argument specifies the number of seconds to sleep by between successive attempts to backup remaining pages, can be specified either as an integer or a floating point value. Example 1, copy an existing database into another: Example 2, copy an existing database into a transient copy:\n\nA instance has the following attributes and methods. Executes an SQL statement. Values may be bound to the statement using placeholders. will only execute a single SQL statement. If you try to execute more than one statement with it, it will raise a . Use if you want to execute multiple SQL statements with one call. Executes a parameterized SQL command against all parameter sequences or mappings found in the sequence seq_of_parameters. The module also allows using an iterator yielding parameters instead of a sequence. This is a nonstandard convenience method for executing multiple SQL statements at once. It issues a statement first, then executes the SQL script it gets as a parameter. This method disregards ; any transaction control must be added to sql_script. sql_script can be an instance of . Fetches the next row of a query result set, returning a single sequence, or when no more data is available. Fetches the next set of rows of a query result, returning a list. An empty list is returned when no more rows are available. The number of rows to fetch per call is specified by the size parameter. If it is not given, the cursor’s arraysize determines the number of rows to be fetched. The method should try to fetch as many rows as indicated by the size parameter. If this is not possible due to the specified number of rows not being available, fewer rows may be returned. Note there are performance considerations involved with the size parameter. For optimal performance, it is usually best to use the arraysize attribute. If the size parameter is used, then it is best for it to retain the same value from one call to the next. Fetches all (remaining) rows of a query result, returning a list. Note that the cursor’s arraysize attribute can affect the performance of this operation. An empty list is returned when no rows are available. Close the cursor now (rather than whenever is called). The cursor will be unusable from this point forward; a exception will be raised if any operation is attempted with the cursor. Required by the DB-API. Does nothing in . Required by the DB-API. Does nothing in . Although the class of the module implements this attribute, the database engine’s own support for the determination of “rows affected”/”rows selected” is quirky. For statements, the number of modifications are summed up into . As required by the Python DB API Spec, the attribute “is -1 in case no has been performed on the cursor or the rowcount of the last operation is not determinable by the interface”. This includes statements because we cannot determine the number of rows a query produced until all rows were fetched. With SQLite versions before 3.6.5, is set to 0 if you make a without any condition. This read-only attribute provides the row id of the last inserted row. It is only updated after successful or statements using the method. For other statements, after or , or if the insertion failed, the value of is left unchanged. The initial value of is . Inserts into tables are not recorded. Changed in version 3.6: Added support for the statement. Read/write attribute that controls the number of rows returned by . The default value is 1 which means a single row would be fetched per call. This read-only attribute provides the column names of the last query. To remain compatible with the Python DB API, it returns a 7-tuple for each column where the last six items of each tuple are . It is set for statements without any matching rows as well. This read-only attribute provides the SQLite database used by the object. A object created by calling will have a attribute that refers to con:\n\nThe following Python types can thus be sent to SQLite without any problem: This is how SQLite types are converted to Python types by default: The type system of the module is extensible in two ways: you can store additional Python types in an SQLite database via object adaptation, and you can let the module convert SQLite types to different Python types via converters. Using adapters to store additional Python types in SQLite databases¶ As described before, SQLite supports only a limited set of types natively. To use other Python types with SQLite, you must adapt them to one of the sqlite3 module’s supported types for SQLite: one of NoneType, int, float, str, bytes. There are two ways to enable the module to adapt a custom Python type to one of the supported ones. This is a good approach if you write the class yourself. Let’s suppose you have a class like this: Now you want to store the point in a single SQLite column. First you’ll have to choose one of the supported types to be used for representing the point. Let’s just use str and separate the coordinates using a semicolon. Then you need to give your class a method which must return the converted value. The parameter protocol will be . The other possibility is to create a function that converts the type to the string representation and register the function with . The module has two default adapters for Python’s built-in and types. Now let’s suppose we want to store objects not in ISO representation, but as a Unix timestamp. Writing an adapter lets you send custom Python types to SQLite. But to make it really useful we need to make the Python to SQLite to Python roundtrip work. Let’s go back to the class. We stored the x and y coordinates separated via semicolons as strings in SQLite. First, we’ll define a converter function that accepts the string as a parameter and constructs a object from it. Converter functions always get called with a object, no matter under which data type you sent the value to SQLite. Now you need to make the module know that what you select from the database is actually a point. There are two ways of doing this:\n• None Explicitly via the column name Both ways are described in section Module functions and constants, in the entries for the constants and . The following example illustrates both approaches. There are default adapters for the date and datetime types in the datetime module. They will be sent as ISO dates/ISO timestamps to SQLite. The default converters are registered under the name “date” for and under the name “timestamp” for . This way, you can use date/timestamps from Python without any additional fiddling in most cases. The format of the adapters is also compatible with the experimental SQLite date/time functions. The following example demonstrates this. If a timestamp stored in SQLite has a fractional part longer than 6 numbers, its value will be truncated to microsecond precision by the timestamp converter. The default “timestamp” converter ignores UTC offsets in the database and always returns a naive object. To preserve UTC offsets in timestamps, either leave converters disabled, or register an offset-aware converter with .\n\nThe underlying library operates in mode by default, but the Python module by default does not. mode means that statements that modify the database take effect immediately. A or statement disables mode, and a , a , or a that ends the outermost transaction, turns mode back on. The Python module by default issues a statement implicitly before a Data Modification Language (DML) statement (i.e. / / / ). You can control which kind of statements implicitly executes via the isolation_level parameter to the call, or via the property of connections. If you specify no isolation_level, a plain is used, which is equivalent to specifying . Other possible values are and . You can disable the module’s implicit transaction management by setting to . This will leave the underlying library operating in mode. You can then completely control the transaction state by explicitly issuing , , , and statements in your code. Note that disregards ; any transaction control must be added explicitly. Changed in version 3.6: used to implicitly commit an open transaction before DDL statements. This is no longer the case.\n\nUsing the nonstandard , and methods of the object, your code can be written more concisely because you don’t have to create the (often superfluous) objects explicitly. Instead, the objects are created implicitly and these shortcut methods return the cursor objects. This way, you can execute a statement and iterate over it directly using only a single call on the object. # close is not a shortcut method and it's not called automatically, # so the connection object should be closed manually Accessing columns by name instead of by index¶ One useful feature of the module is the built-in class designed to be used as a row factory. Rows wrapped with this class can be accessed both by index (like tuples) and case-insensitively by name: \"select 'John' as name, 42 as age\" Using the connection as a context manager¶ Connection objects can be used as context managers that automatically commit or rollback transactions. In the event of an exception, the transaction is rolled back; otherwise, the transaction is committed: # con.rollback() is called after the with block finishes with an exception, the # exception is still raised and must be caught # Connection object used as context manager only commits or rollbacks transactions, # so the connection object should be closed manually"

        "document": "In this article, we’ll kick the tires of SQLite. We’ll learn how to use SQLite through a Python library called sqlite3. At the very end, we’ll explore some more advanced features provided by to make our job easier.\n\nNote: before getting started, it’s good to be familiar with SQL. If you aren’t, you might want to check out Simply SQL.\n• SQLite is a lightweight, file-based relational database management system that is often used in Python applications due to its simplicity and minimal configuration. It provides concurrent access, allowing multiple processes or threads to access the same database. However, it lacks multi-user functionalities and can’t be managed as a process unlike other database technologies like MySQL or PostgreSQL.\n• The sqlite3 module in Python provides an SQL interface to SQLite and comes pre-installed with Python. It allows users to create a database, connect to it, create tables, insert data, and execute SQL commands. The module also supports placeholders, which allow parameter substitution in SQL commands, making it easier to insert variables into a query.\n• Transactions in SQLite are sequences of operations performed on a database that are treated as a single unit, ensuring data integrity. Python’s sqlite3 module starts a transaction before executing INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or REPLACE statements. Users must call the commit() method to save changes made during the transaction, and can handle transactions explicitly by setting the isolation_level to None when connecting to the database.\n\nThe motto of SQLite is: “Small. Fast. Reliable. Choose any three.”\n\nSQLite is an embedded database library written in C. You may be familiar with other database technologies like MySQL or PostgreSQL. These use a client-server approach: the database is installed as a server, and then a client is used to connect to it. SQLite is different: it’s known as an embedded database, because it’s included in a program as a library. All the data is stored in a file — usually with a extension — and you have functions that allow you to run SQL statements or do any other operation on the database.\n\nThe file-based storage solution also provides concurrent access, meaning that multiple processes or threads can access the same database. Okay, so what are the usages of SQLite? Is it suitable for any kind of application?\n\nWell, there are a few cases where SQLite excels:\n• Being included on most mobile operating systems, like Android and iOS, SQLite could be a perfect choice if you want a self-contained and serverless data storage solution.\n• Instead of using huge CSV files, you can exploit the power of SQL and put all your data into a single SQLite database.\n• SQLite can be used to store configuration data for your applications. In fact, SQLite is 35% faster than a file-based system like a configuration file.\n\nOn the other hand, what are some reasons for not choosing SQLite?\n• SQLite still a file-based data storage solution, not a service. You can’t manage it as a process, you can’t start or stop it, or manage the resource usage.\n\nAs I said in the introduction, SQLite is a C library. There are interfaces written in a lot of languages though, including Python. The module provides an SQL interface and requires at least SQLite 3.7.15.\n\nThe awesome thing is that comes with Python, so you don’t need to install anything.\n\nIt’s time to code! In this first part, we’ll create a basic database. The first thing to do is create a database and connect to it:\n\nOn line 1, we import the library. Then, inside a code block, we call to initialize a connection to the database. If everything goes right, will be an instance of the object. If the fails, we print the exception received and the connection to the database is closed. As stated in the official documentation, each open SQLite database is represented by a object. Each time we have to execute an SQL command, the object has a method called . In database technologies, a cursor is a control structure that enables traversal over the records in a database.\n\nNow, if we execute this code we should get the following output:\n\nIf we look at the folder where our Python script is, we should see a new file called . This file has been created automatically by .\n\nAt this point, we’re ready to create a new table, add the first entries and execute SQL commands like , or .\n\nTo create a table, we just need to execute a simple SQL statement. In this example, we’ll create a students table that will contain the following data:\n\nAfter the line, add this:\n\nWe create a table and call the method, which is used when we want to execute a single SQL statement.\n\nThen, we do an for each row we want to add. After all of our changes have been done, we call to commit the pending transaction to the database. Without calling the method, any pending change to the database will be lost. Lastly, we close the connection to the database by calling the method.\n\nOkay, now let’s query our database! We’ll need a variable to save the results of our query, so let’s save the result of to a variable called :\n\nAfter executing this, we’ll see all of the records to :\n\nAt this point, you might have noticed that, inside the method, we put the SQL command that must be executed. Nothing changes in the Python syntax if we want to execute another SQL command like or .\n\nThe method needs a string as an argument. In the previous section, we saw how to insert data into our database, but everything was hard-coded. What if we need to store in the database something that’s in a variable? For this reason, has some fancy things called placeholders. Placeholders allow us to use parameter substitution, which will make inserting a variable into a query much easier.\n\nLet’s see this example:\n\nWe create a method called . This method takes four arguments: the first one is a instance, and the other three will be used in our SQL command.\n\nEach inside the variable represents a placeholder. This means that, if you call the function with , and , the statement will become .\n\nWhen we call the function, we pass our command and all of the variables that will be substituted to the placeholders. From now on, every time we need to insert a row in the student table, we call the method with the parameters required.\n\nEven if you aren’t new to the definition of a transaction, let me give a quick recap of its importance. A transaction is a sequence of operations performed on a database that’s logically treated as a single unit.\n\nThe most important benefit of a transaction is ensuring data integrity. It might be useless in the example we introduced above, but when we deal with more data stored in multiple tables, transactions do make the difference.\n\nPython’s module starts a transaction before execute() and executemany() executes , , , or statements. This implies two things:\n• We must take care of calling the method. If we call without doing a , all of the changes we made during the transaction will be lost.\n• We can’t open a transaction in the same process using .\n\nHow? By using the function call instead of . By setting to , we force to never open transactions implicitly.\n\nThe following code is a rewriting of the previous code, but with the explicit usage of transactions:\n\nI hope you now have a good understanding of what SQLite is, how you can use it for your Python projects, and how some of its advanced features work. The explicit management of transactions might be a bit tricky at first, but it can certainly help you make the most of .\n• An Introduction to Python Unit Testing with unittest and pytest\n\nFrequently Asked Questions About Using SQLite With Python"

        "document": "SQLite is a C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database that doesn’t require a separate server process and allows accessing the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language. Some applications can use SQLite for internal data storage. It’s also possible to prototype an application using SQLite and then port the code to a larger database such as PostgreSQL or Oracle.\n\nInstead, use the DB-API’s parameter substitution. Put as a placeholder wherever you want to use a value, and then provide a tuple of values as the second argument to the cursor’s method. (Other database modules may use a different placeholder, such as or .) For example:\n\nTo retrieve data after executing a SELECT statement, you can either treat the cursor as an iterator, call the cursor’s method to retrieve a single matching row, or call to get a list of the matching rows.\n\nSetting this makes the SQLite interface parse the column name for each column it returns. It will look for a string formed [mytype] in there, and then decide that “mytype” is the type of the column. It will try to find an entry of “mytype” in the converters dictionary and then use the converter function found there to return the value. The column name found in does not include the type, i. e. if you use something like in your SQL, then we will parse out everything until the first for the column name and strip the preceeding space: the column name would simply be «Expiration date». Opens a connection to the SQLite database file database. By default returns a object, unless a custom factory is given. database is a path-like object giving the pathname (absolute or relative to the current working directory) of the database file to be opened. You can use to open a database connection to a database that resides in RAM instead of on disk. detect_types defaults to 0 (i. e. off, no type detection), you can set it to any combination of and to turn type detection on. Due to SQLite behaviour, types can’t be detected for generated fields (for example ), even when detect_types parameter is set. In such case, the returned type is . If uri is true, database is interpreted as a URI. This allows you to specify options. For example, to open a database in read-only mode you can use: Cambiato nella versione 3.7: database can now also be a path-like object, not only a string. Registers a callable to convert a bytestring from the database into a custom Python type. The callable will be invoked for all database values that are of the type typename. Confer the parameter detect_types of the function for how the type detection works. Note that typename and the name of the type in your query are matched in case-insensitive manner.\n\nThis routine registers a callback. The callback is invoked for each attempt to access a column of a table in the database. The callback should return if access is allowed, if the entire SQL statement should be aborted with an error and if the column should be treated as a NULL value. These constants are available in the module. By default, or when pages is either or a negative integer, the entire database is copied in a single step; otherwise the method performs a loop copying up to pages pages at a time.\n\nmode means that statements that modify the database take effect immediately.

Overall, it's a deep dive into SQLite's JSON capabilities, offering valuable insights and practical approaches for programmers dealing with JSON data in SQLite.\n\nIn the prior article, Learning the Basics: How to Use JSON in SQLite, we dived into SQLite's essential JSON functions and their capabilities. We explored the use of JSON as unstructured data within an SQLite database. Crucially, we detailed some of the necessary SQLite JSON functions, discussing their role in data storage and retrieval, followed by practical SQL query examples. This foundational understanding of how to work with JSON data in SQLite sets the stage for your advanced exploration of the topic.\n\nIntegrating SQL and NoSQL Capabilities Through Fully Grasping JSON Handling in SQLite\n\nAdvancing your knowledge about SQLite's JSON handling capabilities combines the best of SQL and NoSQL, providing an efficient, all-in-one solution for managing mixed data formats.

You’ll be learning about how to apply indexes, query with path expressions, filter, and even validate data—essential tasks for handling dynamic data in structured environments using JSON functions in SQLite.\n• Section 1: How To Integrate JSON Within SQLite?\n• Section 3: Practical Approaches To Query Any Complex JSON Data in SQLite\n• Section 4: How To Check the Schema of Your JSON Data in SQLite?\n• Section 5: How To Manage Nested JSON Data in SQLite\n• Section 6: How To Use Indexing for Query Optimization Over JSON Data in SQLite?\n• Section 8: Common Mistakes and Troubleshooting When Working With JSON in SQLite\n\nSection 1: How To Integrate JSON Within SQLite?\n\nSQLite's built-in JSON functions play a pivotal role in integrating JSON and SQLite. As of SQLite version 3.38.0, released in 2022-02-22 onwards, JSON functions are included by default, whereas before they were an extension. This means that before this version these JSON functions in SQLite were opt-in, whereas now they are available by default and can be opt-out by setting a compile-time option, in case you need to disable them.\n\nYou can import JSON data into SQLite using simple insert SQL queries. Alternatively, you can also utilize third-party tools or scripting techniques to bulk import extensive JSON datasets as well. To extract JSON data, you can leverage the json_extract() function that fetches values linked to a specific key from a JSON data column.\n\nIn this section we are going to explore advanced JSON functions and their capabilities in SQLite, using SQL query examples for each one. Throughout this blog post, we are going to use sample generated JSON data, named movie as a reference to be used as examined data:\n\nYou can insert the data into a table named movie with one field named data, and start running these sample queries from now on against it. In the following queries, we are going to use the input texts of JSON functions, to be straightforward about the explanation of the functions, and then we’ll get back to the data inserted in the database starting from section 3.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity in this example, we are going to use a simpler version of the first JSON data:\n\nThe json_error_position() function can be used to detect any error in the syntax of your JSON data. If the input string is a valid JSON it will return 0, otherwise, it will return the character position of the first error.\n\nFor example, if you have a broken JSON string as the input of this function like this:\n\nThe result of running this query would be the position of error syntax that occurred, which in this case is the position of missing “}” at the end:\n\nThe json_patch() function merges 2 JSON objects, allowing to add, modify, and delete JSON objects.\n\nFor example, this query would combine the 2 JSON inputs into 1 JSON:\n\nThe result would be something like this, a JSON object constructed of both of the fields:\n\nManipulate JSON Fields by Using the Function in SQLite\n\nThe json_set() function is used to add or replace JSON properties. takes a JSON string as its first argument followed by zero or more pairs of path/value arguments. The result would be a JSON string created from adding or replacing values based on the provided path and value pairs.\n\nFor example, building on the previous query’s JSON data, if you want to append a field to the JSON data, you can write a query like this:\n\nAnd the result would be something like this:\n\nThe json_quote() function is a simple one, it just wraps the input value with double quotes to make it a valid JSON string. Here is a simple query example of it:\n\nAnd the result would be something like this:\n\nHow To Use and JSON Functions in SQLite for Aggregation\n\nFor this set of JSON functions in SQLite, we need to expand the sample JSON data in comparison with the previous examples, to demonstrate the use case of each function in an understandable way. Suppose this is your table in the database with one field named , as mentioned at the start of this section:\n\nThe Aggregate Function With SQL Query Example\n\nThe json_group_array() function similar to any other aggregate function in SQLite, groups multiple rows of data into a single JSON array.\n\nFor example, this query would return a JSON array with all the names of the movies with a Rate bigger than 6:\n\nAnd the result would be something like this:\n\nThe JSON Function With SQL Query Example\n\nThe json_group_object() function creates a JSON object by grouping two columns of a query, where the first column is used as the key, and the second as the value. The first will be used as the key name of the JSON fields, and the second as their values.\n\nFor example, this query will return a JSON object where each field’s name is a movie's ID and the field’s value is the corresponding Name if the has a Rate bigger than 6, which would exclude the last movie:\n\nThe result would be something like this, a JSON object consisting of the ID and Name of the first and second movies because they have a greater than 5:\n\nParse JSON Data With and Table-Valued Functions in SQLite\n\nSQLite offers two powerful table-valued functions to work with your JSON data, and . They have variations with and without the path parameter, allowing you to interact with your JSON at different depths.\n\nSuppose this is your only JSON value inserted in the data field of the movie table in the SQLite database, let’s start explaining the aggregate functions upon it:\n\nThe Function in SQLite With SQL Query Example\n\nThe json_each() function breaks a JSON object into rows, with each row representing a field in the JSON object, going only through level 1 of nested JSON fields.\n\nFor example, this query would return 8 rows for each field in the JSON data:\n\nThe result would be something like this, listing the key and values of each field in the JSON as a row, As you see, the array field and are listed as they are, and the function did not go into them to list the second level items:\n\nThe Function in SQLite With SQL Query Example\n\nThe json_tree() function is used to traverse and parse JSON data completely, meaning it would go into each field through all the nested levels. The function goes through the JSON, examining every part of it, and then gives you a table that details every element it found.\n\nThe displays the results as a set of rows, providing a clear view of even the most complex nested JSON data. This table tells you the name of each element, what type of data it is, its value, and where it is located within the JSON structure.\n\nSo This query would return several rows, describing the structure of the JSON object, including the nested Cast field:\n\nThe result of the above query would be something like this:\n\nWith the path parameter, can focus on a specific part of the JSON. If you give a specific path in the JSON as the second argument, it will start its exploration from there.\n\nFor example, this query ignores everything outside the Cast field, offering a focused view of this nested JSON array:\n\nThe result of the above query would be something like this:\n\nSection 3: Practical Approaches To Query Any Complex JSON Data in SQLite\n\nUsing SQLite's JSON functions in collaboration with SQLite’s built-in functions allows you to perform more complex data querying. Here you can see some of these examples including aggregation, filtering, and path expressions.\n\nAs mentioned at the beginning of the post, the JSON data in the table in the examples for all of the remained sections would be like this:\n\nThis approach involves using JSON functions along with SQLite's built-in aggregate functions to perform calculations on JSON data. For example, you can calculate the average Runtime of the movie categorized as a Comedy by using the following query:\n\nThe result of the above query would be something like this since there are 2 movies in the database with the Comedy genre, and their Runtime is 90 and 98, so the average of them would be like this:\n\nYou can utilize the function in SQLite for in-depth filtering by using it in the clause of an SQL query. For example, you can filter movies based on specific conditions, such as the movies that have two Cast members or more, and a higher than a certain value.\n\nThe result of the above query would be something like this:\n\nUsing Path Expressions To Extract Specific Values From JSON Data in SQLite\n\nPath expressions can be used to access nested JSON data at that specific address. This example returns a list of all who directed a movie in a certain Genre, like History.\n\nThe result of the above query would be something like this:\n\nSection 4: How To Check the Schema of Your JSON Data in SQLite?\n\nSchema checking of JSON data in SQLite is a way to ensure the structure and consistency of your data, improve future error handling, and simplify complex data manipulation. Although SQLite lacks built-in functions for schema validation, you can use its JSON and the CHECK function for this purpose.\n\nThe function can be used to check the type of a field in the JSON data. For example, building on the previous creation of the movie table, suppose when creating the table to store a movie’s JSON data, you want to ensure that every entry has the Name and Year fields, with Year being an integer. For that, you can use a CHECK() constraint with the function in the table creation:\n\nHere checks the type of the specified fields in your JSON data, the Name, and the Year. If a new insertion or update operation tries to add data where Name does not exist or Year is not an integer, the CHECK() constraint will fail and the operation will be rejected. This helps maintain the data integrity of your JSON data in the movie table.\n\nValidating JSON Data Using the Function in SQLite\n\nThe function verifies the validity of the JSON data from the JSON standard format perspective, offering a degree of schema validation. For example, to ensure the integrity of the JSON data before insertion, you can apply validation checks like this:\n\nIn this statement, checks whether the provided JSON string is valid. If it is, the data is inserted into the movie table and if it isn't, the operation is skipped. This safeguard prevents the insertion of malformed JSON data.\n\nLet’s consider another example combining the two rules, the constraint in the creation phase of the movie table, and the check in the insertions. Considering the following query:\n\nThe result of this query would be a “CHECK constraint failed” error message since the input value doesn’t have a Name field and the Year field is not an integer, so the insert would fail, even though the provided JSON data is a valid JSON.\n\nMoreover, for better thorough schema validation over complicated and nested JSON data, you may consider Python's JSONschema library as well.\n\nSection 5: How To Manage Nested JSON Data in SQLite\n\nNavigating nested and hierarchical JSON data in SQLite can present some challenges. However, SQLite's inbuilt JSON functions streamline this process and make it manageable. Here you can see some strategies to manage nested JSON in SQLite.\n\nSQLite's and functions can help you navigate through the layers of nested JSON data. Consider this query that uses to parse through the data and to selectively pull the required information.\n\nFor example, this query will dig into the Cast array in each JSON record in the field in the table, and will list the that have more than 2 members:\n\nThe result of the above query would be something like this:\n\nJSON objects can hold important information in the form of an array, by using and in combination, you can iterate through these nested arrays and extract data from them.\n\nFor example, this query fetches each ’s name from the Cast array of each movie record:\n\nThe result of this query would be this:\n\nFlattening JSON Data Using the Function in SQLite\n\nAt times, simplifying nested JSON structures by flattening can be a practical approach to solving some complex queries against JSON objects. SQLite's function can be used for flattening JSON objects.\n\nFor example, this query employs to convert the JSON data into a table of key-value pairs, completely flattened, the query would fetch each primary value type, going through arrays and objects as well, of the first movie record:\n\nThe result of this query would be this:\n\nBy adopting these methods, you can efficiently parse, manage, and decode JSON data in SQLite, which is invaluable when dealing with complex JSON data.\n\nSection 6: How To Use Indexing for Query Optimization Over JSON Data in SQLite?\n\nIndexing JSON data in SQLite is an effective way to optimize search operations and enhance query performance, especially for large datasets. By creating an index based on certain JSON properties, you can significantly expedite search operations on a JSON column.\n\nThe principle behind this approach is simple. Instead of performing a full table scan and parsing the JSON for each row, which can be resource-consuming, SQLite can leverage the index to quickly locate the rows of interest.\n\nHow To Add SQL Indexing on JSON Data in SQLite?\n\nLet's consider a practical example with the dataset. For instance, if you frequently search for movies by their , creating an index on this property would be beneficial:\n\nHere, the is the column with the JSON data, and the is the table. The function extracts the of each 's JSON data, and SQLite uses this value to create an index.\n\nOnce you run this query and the index is established, SQLite can quickly retrieve data when you query for a movie by its . This query would be much faster with the idx_name index in place. Therefore, adding indexing to JSON data in SQLite offers powerful optimization capabilities, making it an efficient way to manage large JSON datasets.\n\nHow To Create One Index on Multiple Fields of JSON Data in SQLite?\n\nLet's consider another example in which you may query for specific data more often based on more than 1 field. For example, if you frequently search for by Name and Year, creating an index on these properties together would be beneficial. In SQLite, this could be done by creating an index on a calculated expression:\n\nOnce again, when this index is established, SQLite can quickly retrieve data when you query for a movie by Name and Year.\n\nThe JSON5 was introduced to support some ECMA-compatible syntax and make JSON a bit more fit to be used as a configuration language. SQLite introduced the JSON5 extension support in version 3.42.0. While SQLite can read and interpret JSON text that includes JSON5 extensions, any JSON text SQLite’s functions generate will strictly fit the definition of canonical JSON. Here are some of the primary features the JSON5 extension adds to JSON support in SQLite.\n\nJSON5 allows for single (//...) and multi-line (/.../) comments. This can be particularly useful for adding context or explanations directly within your JSON data. Here’s an example of comments in JSON objects:\n\nIn JSON5, object keys can be unquoted identifiers, simplifying your JSON syntax. However, it's important to note that this may limit compatibility with systems strictly following JSON standards.\n\nJSON5 supports multiline strings, which can be achieved by escaping new line characters. This is useful when dealing with large strings or when formatting the string in a more readable format.\n\nHere we’ll be going through the complete validation techniques for JSON5 and canonical JSON objects, explaining their support by precise SQL query examples in the SQLite database.\n\nTo determine whether a string is valid JSON5, you can use the function. This function will return a non-zero value if the string is not well-formed JSON or JSON5. Here’s an example:\n\nThe result of this query would be 0 indicating that no error is detected here, even though the key is unquoted since this is a valid extension of JSON5.\n\nOn the other hand, to convert a JSON5 string into canonical JSON, you can use the function. While this function recognizes and processes JSON5 input, it will output canonical JSON only. This allows for backward compatibility with systems expecting canonical JSON. Here’s an example:\n\nThe result of this query would be a canonical JSON, converted from the JSON5 format, which made the key quoted here:\n\nHowever, be aware that the function will continue to report false for inputs that are not canonical JSON, even if the input is valid JSON5. This is an important distinction when working with both canonical JSON and JSON5 in SQLite. For example, consider the following query:\n\nThe result of this query would be 0 indicating that this is not a valid JSON, since it has an unquoted key which is a violation of canonical JSON format:\n\nSection 8: Common Mistakes and Troubleshooting When Working With JSON in SQLite\n\nHandling JSON data in SQLite involves some common pitfalls that can be avoided with a deeper understanding of the specific mechanisms, such as the correct use of functions. Here are some key considerations.\n\nHow To Debug Syntax Errors in JSON Data in the JSON Parsing Phase of SQLite?\n\nJSON data must be formatted correctly and follow a specific standard syntax to be parsed and processed in the SQLite database. If your JSON string is improperly formatted, SQLite won't be able to interpret it, resulting in errors. For example, you may have mismatched brackets, incorrect use of quotes, or misplaced commas.\n\nSQLite provides the function for validating JSON string, as the name suggests. function returns 1 if the input is a well-formed JSON string and 0 otherwise. Here's an example:\n\nIn the case of a syntax error in the JSON string, the function can be used to identify the position in the string where the error happened:\n\nIncorrect Use of JSON Functions While Querying Against JSON Data\n\nMisuse of JSON functions is another common issue, so ensuring a solid understanding of the JSON functions and their usage in SQLite is crucial for successful data handling. For instance, using the wrong path or failing to account for the zero-based index system of JSON arrays in SQLite can lead to errors or incorrect data retrievals.\n\nIt's important to ensure you're not attempting to use BLOBs with JSON functions in SQLite because all of the JSON functions in SQLite currently throw an error if any of their arguments are BLOBs and not valid JSON as input. SQLite currently does not support any binary encoding of JSON, while this is a potential future enhancement.\n\nHow To Do JSON Validation While SQL Querying JSON Data in SQLite?\n\nThe function in SQLite is primarily used to enforce the JSON formatting of a string by adding quotes, escaping necessary characters, etc. Using the function incorrectly could result in a lack of error-catching and potential data inconsistencies.\n\nHowever, it's not designed to validate a JSON. For validating a JSON string or finding a syntax error, use the and functions as discussed previously.\n\nIn this comprehensive guide, we've journeyed through the powerful integration of JSON and SQLite, offering insight into the vast opportunities this combination provides. We started with an overview of SQLite's JSON functions along with their detailed use cases with SQL query examples.\n\nWe explored advanced querying techniques like handling hierarchical JSON data within SQLite. The journey deepened into the mechanics of decoding and managing JSON data, highlighting the usefulness of SQLite functions like and . We also addressed the value of flattening JSON data for efficient data handling.\n\nThen we moved into a significant area that is often overlooked, performance-boosting via indexing. This powerful optimization can greatly speed up query performance and enhance your SQLite experience with JSON. The new-age JSON5 extension was then discussed, bringing more flexibility to your JSON data formatting.\n\nLastly, we addressed some common mistakes and troubleshooting tips to smoothen your journey through JSON in SQLite, reinforcing the importance of correct JSON syntax and the proper use of SQLite JSON functions.\n\nRemember, learning and experimentation are the keys to unlocking the full potential of JSON in SQLite. As you apply these techniques to your projects, do share your experiences to help others on a similar journey. So, let's continue learning and pushing boundaries with JSON in SQLite. Have a good JSON use!"
