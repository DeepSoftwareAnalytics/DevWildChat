        "document": "Many rural communities across America face several obstacles in the implementation of information and communication technologies (ICTs) initiatives and struggle with the best approaches for leveraging these elements into an economic development strategy. These obstacles include: lack of quality local ICTs infrastructure, funding, inability to aggregate demand, lack of leadership, and lack of technical skills. Thus, these rural communities may be at risk of falling behind in their quality of life and their economic status if they are unable or unwilling to implement and use information technology effectively. Conversely, some rural areas have begun to promote themselves as \"ecommunities,\" successfully employing the use of ICTs as a way of addressing both economic and community development. The main purpose of this study is to identify, examine, and determine critical components of successful community ICTs implementation strategies that build community capacity and promote economic development. This dissertation addresses the key issue of how best to ensure rural citizens have the access and ability for changing access capacity into genuine 21st century opportunities. The specific research question this study seeks to answer is \"What critical factors contribute to successful ICTs implementation strategies in rural areas?\" Many of the implementation strategies and practices vary from one rural community to the next. However, regardless of the strategies used, studies show several key factors which have consistently been attributed to the success of these ICTs initiatives.

        "document": "When I first visited the rural areas of West Africa, I was struck by the simplicity and beauty of life there. But I also noticed the challenges – especially when it came to communication. In communities spread across vast landscapes, traditional methods like word of mouth or radio were the primary means of staying informed. Yet, something remarkable has been happening over the past decade: mobile technology has begun to reshape how these communities communicate, bridging gaps and opening up new possibilities.\n\nBreaking the Silence: How Mobile Technology Has Transformed Communication\n\nIn many rural areas, particularly in developing regions, physical and social isolation has been a significant barrier to communication. Mobile technology has started to break down these barriers, allowing people to connect with family, friends, and services that were previously out of reach.\n\nI remember speaking with a farmer in a small village in northern Nigeria who shared how mobile phones have transformed his business. Before, he would have to travel long distances to sell his produce, often with little knowledge of market prices. Now, with just a simple mobile phone, he can check prices, negotiate deals, and even make transactions without leaving his village. This story is not unique; across rural West Africa, mobile phones are helping to dismantle the walls of isolation that once confined these communities.\n\nInformation is power, and mobile technology is democratizing access to it. In rural areas, where literacy rates may be lower and access to formal education limited, mobile phones are becoming powerful tools for education and awareness.\n\nTake health communication, for example. In places where health infrastructure is sparse, mobile technology has allowed for the rapid dissemination of vital health information. During the COVID-19 pandemic, text messages and mobile apps became lifelines, spreading information about prevention measures, symptoms, and where to seek help. In some areas, mobile technology has even enabled remote medical consultations, a leap that was unimaginable just a few years ago.\n\nOne of the most profound impacts of mobile technology in rural areas is its ability to empower marginalized groups, particularly women. In many rural communities, traditional gender roles often limit women’s access to education, economic opportunities, and even social interactions. However, mobile phones are changing that.\n\nIn several rural areas of Nigeria, I’ve seen women who have started small businesses using their mobile phones. They connect with customers, manage their finances, and even access microloans – all through mobile platforms. This newfound access to technology has given them a voice and an avenue to participate more fully in their communities and economies.\n\nInterestingly, mobile technology is also playing a role in preserving and promoting cultural heritage. In some rural areas, mobile phones are being used to record and share traditional songs, stories, and languages that might otherwise fade away. This digital archiving ensures that these cultural treasures are passed on to future generations while also allowing them to be shared with a broader audience.\n\nDespite the remarkable progress, the journey toward full mobile integration in rural areas is not without its challenges. The digital divide – the gap between those who have access to technology and those who do not – remains a significant issue. In many rural communities, mobile phones are still considered a luxury, and access to reliable internet is often limited or non-existent.\n\nIn remote areas of countries like Sierra Leone or Liberia, connectivity can be spotty at best. Even where there is coverage, the cost of data and mobile services can be prohibitive for many families. Bridging this divide is essential if we are to fully realize the benefits of mobile technology in rural communication.\n\nAnother challenge is literacy, both traditional and digital. While mobile technology offers incredible opportunities, not everyone is equipped to take full advantage of it. In many rural areas, literacy rates are low, and digital literacy – knowing how to use mobile technology effectively – is even lower.\n\nTo address this, there needs to be a concerted effort to provide education and training, ensuring that rural populations can not only access mobile technology but also use it to its fullest potential. This might involve community workshops, school programs, or even peer-to-peer learning initiatives.\n\nThe Way Forward: Leveraging Mobile Technology for Sustainable Development\n\nTo maximize the impact of mobile technology in rural areas, collaboration between governments, NGOs, and private companies is crucial. Public-private partnerships can help expand mobile networks, make devices more affordable, and provide the necessary education and support.\n\nFor instance, mobile operators can work with local governments to expand coverage in underserved areas, while NGOs can offer training programs to boost digital literacy. Governments can play a role by providing incentives for companies to invest in rural infrastructure or by subsidizing the cost of mobile devices and data.\n\nInnovation will also be key. Mobile technology is evolving rapidly, and new solutions tailored specifically to the needs of rural communities are emerging. For example, low-cost smartphones designed for rural markets, solar-powered charging stations, and apps that work well with low bandwidth are just a few innovations that could make a significant difference.\n\nAnother area ripe for innovation is mobile banking. In regions where traditional banking infrastructure is lacking, mobile money services are already making a huge impact, allowing people to save, borrow, and transfer money with ease. Expanding these services can further empower rural communities economically.\n\nFinally, fostering local content and applications is essential. Mobile technology should not just be a tool for accessing global content; it should also be a platform for creating and sharing local knowledge and culture. Encouraging the development of apps, services, and content that reflect the needs and realities of rural communities will ensure that mobile technology remains relevant and valuable.\n\nMobile technology has already begun to transform communication in rural areas, bringing about significant social, economic, and cultural changes. While challenges remain, the potential for continued progress is immense. By addressing the barriers to access and ensuring that all communities are equipped to benefit from mobile technology, we can open up new opportunities for communication, education, and development in rural areas.\n\nAs we move forward, let’s remember the power of mobile technology to connect, empower, and transform. It’s not just about making phone calls or sending texts; it’s about building bridges between people, communities, and opportunities that were once out of reach.\n\nSalett Nogueira is an accomplished Strategic Communication Expert with over two decades of experience, including 13 years in pivotal roles at ECOWAS.

        "document": "Countries around the world are exploring ways to transition away from fossil fuels. The transition, prompted by carbon emissions that exacerbate climate change, is vast and includes renewables such as solar, wind, and hydro. But is transitioning as simple as choosing renewables for energy? What other facets must be considered in this transition? Nutifafa Yao Doumon is an IEE faculty member and an assistant professor in the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences. He and his students have been thinking about what the transition will require, what challenges lie ahead, and what could go right/wrong in the process.\n\nWhat factors should be considered in the transition to renewable energy?\n\nI recently had a similar discussion with my graduate students in MatSE 597 (Organic/Hybrid Optoelectronic & Photovoltaic Devices), a course that discusses renewable energy, sustainability, and energy transition. We agreed that meeting the energy transition is a complex challenge that requires a multifaceted approach. Though the following factors may not be exhaustive, they are crucial for the transition to renewable energy:\n\nWhat are some of the main challenges in the transition to solar energy?\n\nThe energy transition is not a simple task. It faces many multifaceted challenges, including technological, environmental, societal, economic, and geopolitical issues. Here, I will comment briefly on the technological and geopolitical aspects to give you a sense of the complexity we are dealing with.\n\nFrom a geopolitical perspective, it is crucial to acknowledge the concerns of many regions or countries in the global south. They believe the West is coercing them into adopting renewable technologies, arguing that they have not been the main contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and that transitioning to other energy sources is not a priority, especially when they have not yet reached the level of development that the West has experienced. They believe, especially in Africa, that this may stall Africa’s rise out of poverty. These opinions are thoroughly expressed in two op-eds authored separately by the ex-vice-president of Nigeria, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo in an Economist op-ed (paywall), and the president of Uganda, his excellency Yoweri K. Museveni, in a Wall Street Journal op-ed (paywall). This could be a whole debate on its own.\n\nFrom a technological perspective, the energy transition seems to be equated with transitioning entirely from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources through novel technologies. While this is an ideal scenario for the betterment of the planet, the reality could involve drastically reducing fossil fuels and significantly increasing renewable fuels. Most renewable energy technologies are not fully mature and do not yet match fossil fuels in terms of societal integration. Silicon-based solar technology, the most established, has an efficiency of 26% and a lifespan of 20-25 years. Many other solar technologies, such as organic, dye-sensitized, and perovskite solar cells, are still under investigation and not yet market-ready due to their low efficiency and instability.\n\nThe biggest challenge to solar technology is that it cannot be a standalone solution; it needs complementary storage technologies like batteries to be fully accessible 24/7. Solar installations also require significant land, often in farming communities. Mining for materials to sustain solar and battery technologies opens a new set of challenges. There are many ramifications in terms of challenges that solar power or panels face during their lifespan, including disposal or recycling of this technology.\n\nWhat opportunities exist to make the transition more just and sustainable?\n\nWe have many opportunities and lessons from our past actions and inactions to make the transition more just and sustainable. Deploying some of the renewable technologies can be region-, location-, or geography-dependent. For example, solar energy is highly efficient in hot climates, predominantly found in the global south, while wind energy is more suitable for regions with high natural wind speeds.\n\nGlobal cooperation and collective action are crucial for investing in renewable energy infrastructures and driving technology innovation and R&D geared toward making the transition just and sustainable. Our past actions have shown that raw materials and minerals mining and processing can negatively impact deprived, rural, local, or Indigenous communities. This past knowledge gives us an opportunity to do better this time. However, this will require the involvement of communities themselves, the right policies, governments, and political will.\n\nHow could these opportunities impact researchers' work?\n\nThese opportunities could open the door for research diversification and inter-/multi-disciplinary team collaboration. Investing money and time into innovation and R&D of new technology for renewable energy harvesting, conversion, and storage is vital. It is also crucial to ensure that communities appreciate the efforts and technologies that could potentially replace or be in the mix with existing fossil fuel-based assets and gadgets.\n\nTherefore, I see a considerable impact not only on how the community of researchers should approach research from an interdisciplinary and community-engagement perspective but also on how renewable technology companies and industries approach their R&D portfolios. Topical research must also involve pre- and post-technology development and deployment assessment. Researchers are becoming increasingly aware of their research’s carbon footprint, developing new and efficient work methods, and embedding sustainability in their processes.\n\nWhat could go wrong if we are not mindful of these challenges?\n\nThe danger here is friction between the global south and global north and imminent fracture on the geopolitical front. Global warming and climate change are universal threats and must be confronted together. Working together voluntarily and collectively as equals, knowing our strengths and weaknesses, is the right way forward. Otherwise, countries in the global south may resist the push toward a green energy transition, becoming immediate and/or future polluters of the planet, which contrasts with the desired outcome.\n\nOn the technological side, though it may be insignificant, there is a risk that we may fail to fully realize the technological dream and deploy all renewable energy sources in time to mitigate global warming. Finally, in the quest for these technologies, we may end up worsening environmental pollution levels, health hazards, living standards, and well-being of different communities globally.\n\nWhat could go right if we address these challenges?\n\nAlmost everything, from solving energy crises in major geographical locations through global cooperation and collective action to protecting our collective environment through equal treatment, climate justice, and mitigating global warming. A collective, well-coordinated effort can help us achieve our renewable energy and climate goals, creating a more sustainable and equitable energy landscape for future generations.\n\nNutifafa Yao Doumon is an assistant professor and Virginia S. & Philip L. Walker Jr. Faculty Fellow in the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences. With a background in physics, nanoscience, and leadership, his main interest focuses on materials for solar technologies. He conducts research into Optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices, looking at stability testing and chemical characterization of the active layer, indoor/outdoor testing of organic/perovskite photovoltaic modules, and characterization of degradation and failure modes/mechanisms."
