(Note that this was formerly called the Win32 API. The name Windows API more accurately reflects its roots in 16-bit Windows and its support on 64-bit Windows.)\n\nThe Windows UI API creates and uses windows to display output, prompt for user input, and carry out the other tasks that support interaction with the user. Most applications create at least one window.\n\nThe Diagnostics API enable you to troubleshoot application or system problems and monitor performance.\n\nThe Graphics, multimedia, audio, and video APIs enable applications to incorporate formatted text, graphics, audio, and video.\n\nThe System Services APIs give applications access to the resources of the computer and the features of the underlying operating system, such as memory, file systems, devices, processes, and threads.\n\nThe Security and Identity APIs enable password authentication at logon, discretionary protection for all sharable system objects, privileged access control, rights management, and security auditing.\n\nThe System administration interfaces enable you to install, configure, and service applications or systems.\n\nThe Networking APIs enable communication between applications over a network. You can also create and manage access to shared resources, such as directories and network printers.\n\nThe following are technologies and APIs that are outdated or have been replaced or deprecated from the Windows client and server operating systems.\nâ€¢ Microsoft UDDI SDK is now included with Microsoft BizTalk Server."

While I don't completely understand the whole technique, it seems like I should be able to do something like hook the Windows API's ReadProcessMemory() function and have my process call a function whenever something reads its memory. While I only want to do this out of curiosity, hooking into windows functions seems like it would be very useful in the prevention of hacking in online games.\n\nUnfortunately, there is a big lack of tutorials, articles etc. on this subject. I have looked over a lot of injection code but a lack of understanding is holding me back. Is what I want to do possible, and can anyone point me in the right direction?\n\nI should mention that this is my first time willingly stepping outside of OO programming, so I apologise if this makes no sense."

For more information, see Security Developer Center.\n\nThe Security Development Life Cycle (SDL) is a process that aligns a series of security-focused activities and deliverables to each phase of software development. These activities and deliverables include:\n\nFor more information about the SDL, see the Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle.\n\nConducting a threat model analysis can help you discover potential points of attack in your code. For more information about threat model analysis, see Howard, Michael and LeBlanc, David [2003], Writing Secure Code, 2d ed., ISBN 0-7356-1722-8, Microsoft Press, Redmond, Washington. (This resource may not be available in some languages and countries.)\n\nBuild and test environments should mirror the same levels of service packs and security updates of the targeted user base. We recommend that you install the latest service packs and security updates for any Microsoft platform or application that is part of your build and test environment and encourage your users to do the same for the finished application environment. For more information about service packs and security updates, see Microsoft Windows Update and Microsoft Security.\n\nYou should create applications that require the least possible privilege. Using the least possible privilege reduces the risk of malicious code compromising your computer system. For more information about running code in least possible privilege level, see Running with Special Privileges.\n\nFor more information about best practices, see the following topics."

I could just save it in some plaintext file. But it looks like from searches that there is something called DPAPI? I'm not sure what is appropriate for my use.
