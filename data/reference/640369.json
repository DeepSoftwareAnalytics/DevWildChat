        "document": "The syntax is very close to the Fortran syntax:\n\nOr you can use a loop with a condition to exit the loop:\n\nThe condition is specified in brackets and must be a logical (TRUE/FALSE).\n\nFor example, let’s loop over all the netCDF files available in the current directory:\n\nWe used the built-in NCL function which allows to make system calls i.e. any available bash statement. In our example, it returns a vector containing the names of all the netCDF files listed in the current directory.\n\nThen to access a single element, use the NCL array syntax i.e. index specified within brackets.\n\nWe used a built-in function ( ) and NCL is a very rich language containing a large number of built-in functions. It would not be possible to enumerate all of them here, so the best is to refer to the NCL documentation here.\n\nTo make your code more modular, you can define your own functions:\n\nThen you can call this function:\n• - reassignment (allow to change the shape and content of a variable)\n• - comment [can appear anywhere; text to right ; ignored]\n• - use to (im/ex)port variables via addfile(s) function(s)\n• - access/create named dimension In NCL, dimensions are ordered using row x column ordering [ie, row major], which is identical to C. By convention, dimensions are numbered from left(0) to right(n-1) where n is the total number of dimensions. NCL allows names to be assigned with dimensions. These named dimensions are essential for reordering an array. A named dimension is created by entering the variable name followed by the ! character, followed by the appropriate dimension index.\n\nIt allows to access an array using the values of its coordinates. For instance, to access T for time=2914, you can either use subscript 4 or:\n• All elements are of the same type\n• Can contain elements of differing types\n• coercion\n• implicit conversion of one type to another\n• automatic coercion when no info is lost\n• let i be integer and x be float or double\n• T(7:12,0, 45,10:20) –> 6 time indices, 1st lev,46th value of lat, 10-20 indices of lon\n• NCL does not have a built-in debugger\n• Look at the message; often describe problem/issue\n• eg: Fatal: left and right side have different sizes\n• http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/\n• numerous downloadable examples to get you going"

        "document": "This section demonstrates how empirical probabilities (return periods) can be obtained for extreme values extracted using methods described in earlier sections.\n\nReturn period indicates duration of time (typically years) which corresponds to a probability that a given value (e.g. wind speed) would be exceeded at least once within a year. This probability is called probability of exceedance and is related to return periods as where is return period.\n\nReturn periods are often incorrectly interpreted in the professional communities as \"100-year event is an event which happens only once in 100 years\", which may lead to inaccurate assessment of risks. A more holistic way of looking at this is to consider a time period within which a risk is evaluated. For example, a 100-year event with probability of exceedance in any given year of 1% would have a probability of ~39.5% to be exceeded at least once within 50 years - this is calculated using this formula:\n\nWhere \\(n\\) is number of return period blocks within a time period (50 for 50 years with retun period block of size 1 year) and \\(p\\) is 1% (100-year event).\n\nEmpirical return periods are assigned to observed extreme values using an empricial rule where extreme values are ordered and ranked from the most extreme (1) to the least extreme (n), then exceedance probabilities are calculated (see the following sub-section), and return periods are calculated as multiples of a given (typically 1 year).\n\nExtreme events extracted using BM or POT methods are assigned exceedance probabilities using the following formula:\n• r - rank of extreme value (1 to n). In rank is calculated using with , which means that extreme events of the same magnitude are assigned average of ranks these values would be assigned otherwise if ranked sequentially. For example, array of would have ranks of .\n• and - empricial plotting position parameters (see further below).\n\nIn this context \\(P\\) corresponds to a probability of exceedance of a value with rank r in a any given time period with duration \\(t/n\\) where \\(t\\) is total duration of series from which the extreme values were drawn and \\(n\\) is number of extreme events. If we measure time in years and we use Block Maxima with block size of 1 year, then the formula \\(t/n\\) becomes 1 by definition and the return period in years can be calculated as \\(1/P\\). For general rule read this tutorial section further.\n\nPlotting positions are sets of empirical coefficients defining how extreme values are assigned probabilities, which are subsequently used to plot extreme values on the probability plots.\n\nPlotting positions have nothing to do with modeling extreme event statistics in modern EVA. Historically, in time before computers became widespread, EVA was performed by plotting extreme events on probability paper (with axes scaled logarithmically and according to a specific plotting position) with the idea that a return value curve for a given model (e.g. GEVD) would be a straight line drawn through these points using a pen and a ruler. Modern EVA fits models to data by maximimizng likelihood function via methods such as MLE or MCMC (read more in other sections). This is only feasible due to the use of computers and would be prohibitively expensive to do manually. Plotting positions are presently used only to show extreme values on return value plots and to perform some goodness-of-fit tests (e.g. P-P or Q-Q plots). TL;DR: plotting positions are NOT used to fit models.\n\nAn example of plotting positions used in is the diagnostic plot where observed extreme values (black dots) are superimposed against the theoretical estimates (by fitting a distribution) as seen in the return value, Q-Q, and P-P plots.\n\nReturn periods are calculated from the exceedance probabilities using the following formula:\n• R - return period as multiple of (by default 1 year).\n• - rate of extreme events (average number of extreme events per ). Calculated as:\n• for Peaks Over Threshold, where is number of extreme events and is total duration of series from which the extreme values were drawn\n\nThe resulting return period R is, therefore, a real number representing a multiple of .\n\nWe have 2 years of data and, using of 30 days (~1 month), we extract 24 extreme events using the Block Maxima method. We then rank the values from 1 to 24 as outlined above and, using the Weibull plotting position (\\(\\alpha=0\\) and \\(\\beta=0\\)), for the most extreme value (rank 1) we get exceedance probability \\(P\\) of 1/25 or 0.04. Let's say we would like to get return period of the most extreme value (rank 1) in years ( of 1 year). First, we calculate extreme value rate \\(\\lambda\\) as / , which gives us 12 (approximately since we used 30 days for ). Now we can use the return period formula above directly as \\(R = 1 / 0.04 / 12 = 2.08\\) years.\n\nestimates empirical return periods for many plotting functions and goodness-of-fit tests behind the scenes using the Weibull plotting position. Return periods can be calculated using the function (shown only for Block Maxima; Peaks Over Threshold works identically with the only difference being the argument):\n\nThe function uses the following parameters:\n• ts - time series ( ) from which the extreme values are extracted\n• extremes_method - extreme value extraction method, must be or .\n• extremes_type - extreme value type: for above threshold (default) and for below threshold.\n• return_period_size - size of return period. Same as the argument. By default this is 1 year.\n\nThe following paramters are used only when :\n• block_size - block size, by default . Internally is converted using the function. If not provided, then it is calculated as median distance between extreme values."
