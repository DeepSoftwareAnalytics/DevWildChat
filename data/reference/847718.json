        "document": "The key is to turn on the mode! No stitching required and no need for loading the page twice.\n\nThis is practically the same code as posted by @Acumenus with slight improvements.\n\nI decided to post this anyway because I did not find an explanation about what is happening when the mode is turned off (the browser is displayed) for screenshot taking purposes. As I tested (with Chrome WebDriver), if the mode is turned on, the screenshot is saved as desired. However, if the mode is turned off, the saved screenshot has approximately the correct width and height, but the outcome varies case-by-case. Usually, the upper part of the page which is visible by the screen is saved, but the rest of the image is just plain white. There was also a case with trying to save this Stack Overflow thread by using the above link; even the upper part was not saved which interestingly now was transparent while the rest still white. The last case I noticed was only once with the given W3Schools link; there where no white parts but the upper part of the page repeated until the end, including the header.\n\nI hope this will help for many of those who for some reason are not getting the expected result as I did not see anyone explicitly explaining about the requirement of mode with this simple approach. Only when I discovered the solution to this problem myself, I found a post by @vc2279 mentioning that the window of a headless browser can be set to any size (which seems to be true for the opposite case too). Although, the solution in my post improves upon that that it does not require repeated browser/driver opening or page reloading.\n\nIf for some pages it does not work for you, I suggest trying to add before getting the size of the page. Another case would be if the page requires scrolling until the bottom to load further content, which can be solved by the method from this post:\n\nAlso, note that for some pages the content may not be in any of the top-level HTML tags like or , for example, YouTube uses tag. As a last note, I found one page that \"returned\" a screenshot still with the horizontal scrollbar, the size of the window needed manual adjustment, i.e., the image width needed to be increased by 18 pixels, like so: ."

        "document": "I managed to get the whole page, without iterations, keys or page downs or the lambda function using code from here and only changing the screen size dimensions.\n\nTrouble is, for your webpage at least, the width has to be re-adjusted (expanded) to take the picture of the entire header, and even then it doesn't take the full width and ends up looking stitched together.\n\nThe header width is problem in simple selenium-only code. (on my system):\n\nAlso, That size I the most I could make it on my machine (limited ram space left) before Pycharm wouldn't run or inform me in error message of rendering problems. But even if I could run entire page maximum, the screen shot would look like this , so I recommend you use @Libin Thomas pytest code.\n\nMy chrome (deliberately downgraded to chrome 89 as webdriver for chrome 90 doesn't exist yet or I could find), also in a very highly markedup authoritative SO thread (here, here or elsewhere - I've read so much but haven't found a simple generic solution for us) and I [mistake it? or take it? that], as one of the highly marked answers in SO says, Chrome Webdriver doesn't have a \"take whole webpage screenshot\" function yet, as you can see in the picture, but FireFox does (which I don't want to use, cant and have deleted. RAM)\n\nAfter doing all that , and a bit more, it dawned on me that I was looking at it the wrong way. ZOOM is what I needed.\n\nI did manage to get a screen shot of the whole thing, clearly, in one go, using after driver opens the page.\n\n(its helped me understand why even your first attempt, and my successful page down scrolling one, our headers appeared stretched and where narrower than the rest of the body).\n\nThe true header is huge compared to the rest, but atleast the screen shot is real and not stretched, or only the middle section of it, Its the whole thing with the real as-is header.\n\n(although probably not what you wanted).\n\nI hope I've helped in some small way, even if not the way you maybe wanted."

The Element Click command could not be completed because the element receiving the events is obscuring the element that was requested to be clicked. Thrown when an element is present in the DOM but interactions with that element will hit another element due to paint order. Thrown when trying to select an unselectable element. Thrown when an element is present on the DOM, but it is not visible, and so is not able to be interacted with. Most commonly encountered when trying to click or read text of an element that is hidden from view. Thrown when activating an IME engine has failed. Thrown when IME support is not available. This exception is thrown for every IME-related method call if IME support is not available on the machine. Navigation caused the user agent to hit a certificate warning, which is usually the result of an expired or invalid TLS certificate. The arguments passed to a command are either invalid or malformed. Thrown when attempting to add a cookie under a different domain than the current URL. The coordinates provided to an interaction’s operation are invalid. Thrown when a command could not be completed because the element is in an invalid state. This can be caused by attempting to clear an element that isn’t both editable and resettable. Thrown when the selector which is used to find an element does not return a WebElement. Currently this only happens when the selector is an xpath expression and it is either syntactically invalid (i.e. it is not a xpath expression) or the expression does not select WebElements (e.g. “count(//input)”). Occurs if the given session id is not in the list of active sessions, meaning the session either does not exist or that it’s not active. Thrown when frame or window target to be switched doesn’t exist. An error occurred while executing JavaScript supplied by the user. Thrown when the target provided to the move() method is invalid, i.e. out of document. Thrown when switching to no presented alert. This can be caused by calling an operation on the Alert() class when an alert is not yet on the screen. Thrown when the attribute of element could not be found. You may want to check if the attribute exists in the particular browser you are testing against. Some browsers may have different property names for the same property. (IE8’s .innerText vs. Firefox .textContent) No cookie matching the given path name was found amongst the associated cookies of the current browsing context’s active document. Raised when driver is not specified and cannot be located. Thrown when element could not be found. If you encounter this exception, you may want to check the following:\n• None Check your selector used in your find_by…\n• None Element may not yet be on the screen at the time of the find operation, (webpage is still loading) see selenium.webdriver.support.wait.WebDriverWait() for how to write a wait wrapper to wait for an element to appear. Thrown when frame target to be switched doesn’t exist. Thrown when trying to access the shadow root of an element when it does not have a shadow root attached. Thrown when window target to be switched doesn’t exist. To find the current set of active window handles, you can get a list of the active window handles in the following way: A new session could not be created. Thrown when a reference to an element is now “stale”. Stale means the element no longer appears on the DOM of the page. Possible causes of StaleElementReferenceException include, but not limited to:\n• None You are no longer on the same page, or the page may have refreshed since the element was located.\n• None The element may have been removed and re-added to the screen, since it was located. Such as an element being relocated. This can happen typically with a javascript framework when values are updated and the node is rebuilt.\n• None Element may have been inside an iframe or another context which was refreshed. Thrown when a command does not complete in enough time. Thrown when an unexpected alert has appeared. Usually raised when an unexpected modal is blocking the webdriver from executing commands. Thrown when a support class did not get an expected web element. The requested command matched a known URL but did not match any methods for that URL.\n\nABC’s allow custom implementations of Webdriver to be registered so that isinstance type checks will succeed.

Returns the handles of all windows within the current session.\n\nABC’s will allow custom types to be registered as a WebElement to pass type checks. Generally, all interesting operations that interact with a document will be performed through this interface. All method calls will do a freshness check to ensure that the element reference is still valid. This essentially determines whether the element is still attached to the DOM. If this test fails, then an is thrown, and all future calls to this instance will fail. Find an element given a By strategy and locator. Find elements given a By strategy and locator. Gets the given attribute or property of the element. This method will first try to return the value of a property with the given name. If a property with that name doesn’t exist, it returns the value of the attribute with the same name. If there’s no attribute with that name, is returned. Values which are considered truthy, that is equals “true” or “false”, are returned as booleans. All other non- values are returned as strings.

        "document": "Python and Selenium are often favored by QAs for automation testing purposes. Going beyond automating basic tasks, Python and Selenium can also be used to automatically take screenshots. This article will discuss how testers can go about doing exactly that.\n\nBefore proceeding, there are a few major advantages to using Python and Selenium for screenshot automation that deserve a look:\n• Provides the ability to run tests across various web browsers\n\nPrerequisites for setting up Selenium & Python for Screenshots\n\nThere are a few dependencies that must be taken care of in order to take a screenshot using Python and Selenium. They are listed below:\n• Install Python and an IDE, preferably PyCharm. It becomes easier to work with the Selenium binding that comes with Python with an IDE.\n• When using Python-Selenium, to get automated responses from web browsers it is necessary to make sure that the Selenium WebDriver is working without any errors. For a hassle-free working of Python and Selenium, make sure the webdriver is in path and matches the compatible version with the web browser.\n• Another Python package named Selenium-Screenshot is often used to take screenshots. Install the package using the pip command (the easiest way to install it).\n• To view the screenshot taken by Selenium and Selenium-Screenshot, use another python package pillow or PIL, from which testers use the Image module to open and display the screenshot.\n• Ensure the path is set correctly for all dependencies. If this is not in place, it may throw unnecessary errors while running the program.\n\nNow that we know about the dependencies, let’s focus on the actual operations.\n\nHow to take a screenshot using Python and Selenium\n\nLet’s divide the whole process into steps for clarity:\n• Take the first screenshot using Selenium WebDriver and function save_screenshot()\n• Take a screenshot using Python selenium-screenshot – Using Screenshot_Clipping from the Screenshot module, and the full_Screenshot() function.\n• View the screenshot using the Image module from the PIL package, and open() and show() functions.\n\nTo use python and selenium, install the following packages. Simply use the pip install command to install them and import the same in the program.\n\nTake the first screenshot using save_screenshot\n\nIn this example, Selenium will navigate to a specific URL (using the Chrome browser) and then take a screenshot using the save_screenshot() function. It will then display the screenshot using pillow.\n\nWhile taking the screenshot, testers need Selenium WebDriver to open a web browser automatically. Now, WebDriver may throw an error stating that the ChromeDriver needs to be in the PATH. To resolve this, simply download a Chrome Driver that is compatible with the current version and give the executable path as shown in the example.\n\nThis example uses a chrome web driver, but testers can use another web browser. Additionally, in order to interact with desktop applications instead of a web application, use one of the several python bindings built for the purpose.\n\nThe above code will open the web browser and open the URL given in the driver.get().\n\nAfter this, the next part of the code will take the screenshot and save it as a .png file.\n\nThe next line of the code will show the screenshot taken using the Selenium WebDriver.\n\nLet’s take a look at the full code below and the output the tester will receive as the screenshot.\n\nSelenium automated the task of opening the web browser and navigating to a custom URL that opened the page shown in the output. After this, using the save_screenshot() method, Selenium grabbed the following image as a screenshot.\n\nThe process here is fairly similar to the one using Python selenium-screenshot. Let’s take a look at the syntax to understand how it’s done.\n\nHere, Selenium opens a browser, navigates to a URL and then captures the screenshot using the full_Screenshot() method of the Screenshot_clipping module.\n\nUse the code below to get the full page screenshot using Selenium and Python.\n\nHere instead of just the visible screen, the driver was able to hover down to the bottom of the web page and capture a long screenshot/full length screenshot using the full_Screenshot() method in the Screenshot_Clipping module.\n\nAs the article demonstrates, taking screenshots using Selenium and Python is easy enough. Run the code outlined, and start taking screenshots quickly and effectively to streamline their automated Selenium testing."

        "document": "Selenium is a powerful tool for automating web browser actions, widely used for testing and web scraping tasks. Traditionally, setting up Selenium required downloading and configuring specific browser drivers, a process that can be time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nThe WebDriver Manager simplifies Selenium setup by automatically handling the installation and setup of the appropriate browser drivers, making it easier to get started and maintain Selenium projects.\n\nThis article explores how to leverage WebDriver Manager in Python, to streamline Selenium projects by automatically downloading, configuring, and updating the appropriate drivers for your chosen browser.\n\nWhat is WebDriver Manager for Selenium?\n\nWebDriver Manager is a Python Library that simplifies the setup of Selenium WebDriver by automatically managing browser driver binaries.\n\nTraditionally, Selenium users needed to manually download and configure drivers like ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver, or EdgeDriver, ensuring compatibility with their browser version.\n\nWebDriver Manager automates this process, detecting the browser type and version and downloading the correct driver, reducing setup complexity and minimizing issues related to driver updates. It streamlines Selenium project setup, making it easier and faster to start running tests or automating browser tasks.\n\nWebDriver Manager is a powerful tool that simplifies browser driver management for Selenium automation projects.\n\nIt automates the otherwise tedious tasks of downloading, installing, and updating WebDriver executables, enabling developers to concentrate on writing test scripts rather than handling driver configuration issues.\n\nA brief overview of how it works can be enumerated as below:\n• Automatically Detects Your Browser Version: WebDriver Manager figures out which browser and version you’re using (like Chrome or Firefox).\n• Downloads the Right Driver: It finds and downloads the correct driver, based on your browser version(for example, ChromeDriver for Chrome).\n• Keeps Drivers Updated: When your browser updates, WebDriver Manager will recognize this and download the latest driver, ensuring compatibility.\n• Streamlines Your Code: Instead of setting up driver paths manually, you can initialize the driver in just one line, making your Selenium scripts simpler and easier to maintain.\n\nThe WebDriver Manager is packed with features that make managing browser drivers easy and efficient for Selenium projects.\n\n1. Automatic Driver Detection: It detects your browser and version and then downloads the matching driver automatically.\n\nFor example, when using Chrome, WebDriver Manager automatically fetches the latest ChromeDriver if not already available.\n\n2. Auto-Updates for Driver Versions: It keeps drivers up to date by checking for the latest compatible driver whenever your browser updates.\n\nFor example, If the user updates Firefox, WebDriver Manager will fetch the latest GeckoDriver next time the script is run.\n\n3. Cross-Browser Support: WebDriver Manager supports a wide range of browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, and more.\n\nEach browser has a dedicated manager class that handles driver management seamlessly.\n\n4. Customization Options: WebDriver Manager allows advanced users to specify driver versions, set custom paths, or choose specific mirror URLs for downloading drivers.\n\nThis flexibility is especially useful in environments requiring strict control over software versions.\n\n5. Streamlined Integration: It integrates effortlessly with Selenium projects, requiring minimal code changes.\n\nWith WebDriver Manager, there’s no need to configure system paths manually or manage driver files explicitly, reducing overhead for developers.\n\nTo use WebDriver Manager in Selenium projects, follow these steps to install and configure it.\n\nIf not installed, download and install Python from python.org.\n\nIf pip is missing, install it by following these instructions.\n\nWebDriver Manager works alongside Selenium. This can be installed using:\n\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to install the WebDriver Manager:\n\nUse pip to install the WebDriver Manager package:\n\nEnsure the package is installed successfully by running:\n\n2.

Organize Tests using a testing framework like unittest or pytest to structure and run multiple test cases efficiently.\n\nRun Selenium Tests on Different Versions of Browsers\n\nWith WebDriver Manager, tests can be run on both a specific browser version and multiple versions programmatically. This section will discuss scenarios for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers.\n\nTesting on Specific and Different Versions of Chrome\n• Install the desired Chrome versions or configure the environment to use them.\n• Specify the ChromeDriver version corresponding to the target Chrome versions using ChromeDriverManager.\n\nTesting on Specific and Different Versions of Firefox\n• Install the desired Firefox versions or ensure the environment is configured for them.\n• Use GeckoDriverManager with specific driver versions to match the target Firefox versions.\n\nTesting on Specific and Different Versions of Edge\n• Install the desired Edge versions or configure the environment accordingly.\n• Use EdgeChromiumDriverManager to fetch specific EdgeDriver versions for testing.\n\nTo run the same test across multiple browsers and versions, the following code snippet can be used :\n\nManaging browser drivers is essential for Selenium-based automation testing. Two popular tools for this task are WebDriver Manager and Selenium Manager. While both simplify the process of handling browser drivers, they have distinct features and use cases.\n\nPython Selenium WebDriver Manager simplifies the management of browser drivers for Selenium-based tests. It automates the process of downloading, updating, and configuring the correct browser drivers, eliminating the need for manual handling and ensuring smooth test execution across various browsers.\n• Automatic Driver Management: WebDriver Manager automatically detects the browser type and version, downloading and configuring the correct driver for the Selenium WebDriver, ensuring compatibility without manual intervention.\n• Version Control for Cross-Browser Testing: With Python WebDriver Manager, you can specify particular driver versions to test across multiple browser versions, ensuring your application functions as expected on different browser releases.\n• Simplifies CI/CD Integration: WebDriver Manager makes it easy to integrate Selenium tests into Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines by automatically resolving and managing the appropriate driver versions for every run.\n• Cross-Platform Support: It handles driver management across various operating systems, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux, enabling consistent browser automation regardless of the platform.\n• Automatic Driver Updates: WebDriver Manager automatically updates browser drivers whenever a new version of the browser is released, ensuring your tests are always running on the latest compatible driver without needing manual updates.\n\nBrowserStack is a cloud-based platform that enables Selenium tests to be executed on real devices and browsers, providing a seamless way to conduct cross-browser and cross-platform testing.\n\nIt allows users to run automated tests on a wide variety of environments without requiring local setup or maintenance.\n\nBrowserStack’s Automate product allows seamless integration with Selenium, enabling automated tests on real browsers in the cloud. This eliminates the need to manage local testing infrastructure and provides access to a variety of browsers, versions, and devices, ensuring comprehensive test coverage.\n\nCheck out this documentation on how to Run Selenium with Python on Browserstack Automate.\n\nWith BrowserStack’s Selenium Grid, users can run tests on multiple browser versions and platforms in parallel. It offers a cloud-hosted grid, enabling tests to be distributed and executed without manual configuration, making parallel test execution efficient and faster.\n\nTo integrate Selenium tests with BrowserStack, follow these steps:\n• Sign up on BrowserStack: Create an account and retrieve the username and access key.\n• Install the BrowserStack Python package: Ensure the necessary dependencies are installed.\n• Configure WebDriver: Modify your Selenium script to use BrowserStack’s remote WebDriver, incorporating the desired capabilities, including browser, platform, and version.\n• Execute Tests: Run the tests and analyze the results directly in BrowserStack’s dashboard.\n\nFor a more detailed process, please refer to this detailed documentation Integrate Your Test Suite with BrowserStack.\n\nBenefits of executing Selenium tests on Real devices using Browserstack\n\nRunning Selenium tests on real devices ensures high-quality, real-world testing. BrowserStack offers the ability to run these tests on actual mobile devices and browsers, providing several key advantages.\n• Wide Device Coverage: Access to a diverse set of devices, screen sizes, and OS versions for comprehensive testing.\n• No Device Management: Eliminates the need for physical device procurement, maintenance, and setup.\n\nWebDriver Manager helps in test automation by eliminating the hassle of manual browser driver management. By automating driver downloads, updates, and compatibility checks, it simplifies the Selenium setup process, saving valuable time and ensuring smoother testing workflows.\n\nAdditionally, leveraging BrowserStack Automate for Selenium test execution offers the benefits of running tests on real devices and a wide array of browsers, ensuring more accurate and comprehensive testing.\n\nTogether, these tools streamline the testing process and ensure cross-browser compatibility, ultimately accelerating development and improving test coverage."

        "document": "Selenium Manager is a command-line tool implemented in Rust that provides automated driver and browser management for Selenium. Selenium bindings use this tool by default, so you do not need to download it or add anything to your code or do anything else to use it.\n\nTL;DR: Selenium Manager is the official driver manager of the Selenium project, and it is shipped out of the box with every Selenium release.\n\nSelenium uses the native support implemented by each browser to carry out the automation process. For this reason, Selenium users need to place a component called driver (chromedriver, geckodriver, msedgedriver, etc.) between the script using the Selenium API and the browser. For many years, managing these drivers was a manual process for Selenium users. This way, they had to download the required driver for a browser (chromedriver for Chrome, geckodriver for Firefox, etc.) and place it in the or export the driver path as a system property (Java, JavaScript, etc.). But this process was cumbersome and led to maintainability issues.\n\nLet’s consider an example. Imagine you manually downloaded the required chromedriver for driving your Chrome with Selenium. When you did this process, the stable version of Chrome was 113, so you downloaded chromedriver 113 and put it in your . At that moment, your Selenium script executed correctly. But the problem is that Chrome is evergreen. This name refers to Chrome’s ability to upgrade automatically and silently to the next stable version when available. This feature is excellent for end-users but potentially dangerous for browser automation. Let’s go back to the example to discover it. Your local Chrome eventually updates to version 115. And that moment, your Selenium script is broken due to the incompatibility between the manually downloaded driver (113) and the Chrome version (115). Thus, your Selenium script fails with the following error message: “session not created: This version of ChromeDriver only supports Chrome version 113”.\n\nThis problem is the primary reason for the existence of the so-called driver managers (such as WebDriverManager for Java, webdriver-manager for Python, webdriver-manager for JavaScript, WebDriverManager.Net for C#, and webdrivers for Ruby). All these projects were an inspiration and a clear sign that the community needed this feature to be built in Selenium. Thus, the Selenium project has created Selenium Manager, the official driver manager for Selenium, shipped out of the box with each Selenium release as of version 4.6.\n\nTL;DR: Selenium Manager is used by the Selenium bindings when the drivers (chromedriver, geckodriver, etc.) are unavailable.\n\nDriver management through Selenium Manager is opt-in for the Selenium bindings. Thus, users can continue managing their drivers manually (putting the driver in the or using system properties) or rely on a third-party driver manager to do it automatically. Selenium Manager only operates as a fallback: if no driver is provided, Selenium Manager will come to the rescue.\n\nSelenium Manager is a CLI (command line interface) tool implemented in Rust to allow cross-platform execution and compiled for Windows, Linux, and macOS. The Selenium Manager binaries are shipped with each Selenium release. This way, each Selenium binding language invokes Selenium Manager to carry out the automated driver and browser management explained in the following sections.\n\nTL;DR: Selenium Manager automatically discovers, downloads, and caches the drivers required by Selenium when these drivers are unavailable.\n\nThe primary feature of Selenium Manager is called automated driver management. Let’s consider an example to understand it. Suppose we want to driver Chrome with Selenium (see the doc about how to start a session with Selenium). Before the session begins, and when the driver is unavailable, Selenium Manager manages chromedriver for us. We use the term management for this feature (and not just download) since this process is broader and implies different steps:\n• Browser version discovery. Selenium Manager discovers the browser version (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) installed in the machine that executes Selenium. This step uses shell commands (e.g., ).\n• Driver version discovery. With the discovered browser version, the proper driver version is resolved. For this step, the online metadata/endpoints maintained by the browser vendors (e.g., chromedriver, geckodriver, or msedgedriver) are used.\n• Driver download. The driver URL is obtained with the resolved driver version; with that URL, the driver artifact is downloaded, uncompressed, and stored locally.\n• Driver cache. Uncompressed driver binaries are stored in a local cache folder ( ). The next time the same driver is required, it will be used from there if the driver is already in the cache.\n\nTL;DR: Selenium Manager automatically discovers, downloads, and caches the browsers driven with Selenium (Chrome, Firefox, and Edge) when these browsers are not installed in the local system.\n\nAs of Selenium 4.11.0, Selenium Manager also implements automated browser management. With this feature, Selenium Manager allows us to discover, download, and cache the different browser releases, making them seamlessly available for Selenium. Internally, Selenium Manager uses an equivalent management procedure explained in the section before, but this time, for browser releases.\n\nThe browser automatically managed by Selenium Manager are:\n• Chrome. Based on Chrome for Testing (CfT), as of Selenium 4.11.0.\n• Firefox. Based on public Firefox releases, as of Selenium 4.12.0.\n• Edge. Based on Edge downloads, as of Selenium 4.14.0.\n\nLet’s consider again the typical example of driving Chrome with Selenium. And this time, suppose Chrome is not installed on the local machine when starting a new session). In that case, the current stable CfT release will be discovered, downloaded, and cached (in ) by Selenium Manager.\n\nBut there is more. In addition to the stable browser version, Selenium Manager also allows downloading older browser versions (in the case of CfT, starting in version 113, the first version published as CfT). To set a browser version with Selenium, we use a browser option called browserVersion.\n\nLet’s consider another simple example. Suppose we set to using Chrome options. In this case, Selenium Manager will check if Chrome 114 is already installed. If it is, it will be used. If not, Selenium Manager will manage (i.e., discover, download, and cache) CfT 114. And in either case, the chromedriver is also managed. Finally, Selenium will start Chrome to be driven programmatically, as usual.\n\nBut there is even more. In addition to fixed browser versions (e.g., , , , etc.), we can use the following labels for :\n• : Version in development at this moment.\n\nWhen these labels are specified, Selenium Manager first checks if a given browser is already installed ( , , etc.), and when it is not detected, the browser is automatically managed.\n\nAutomated Edge management by Selenium Manager in Windows is different from other browsers. Both Chrome and Firefox (and Edge in macOS and Linux) are downloaded automatically to the local cache ( ) by Selenium Manager. Nevertheless, the same cannot be done for Edge in Windows. The reason is that the Edge installer for Windows is distributed as a Microsoft Installer (MSI) file, designed to be executed with administrator rights. This way, when Edge is attempted to be installed with Selenium Manager in Windows with a non-administrator session, a warning message will be displayed by Selenium Manager as follows:\n\nTherefore, administrator permissions are required to install Edge in Windows automatically through Selenium Manager, and Edge is eventually installed in the usual program files folder (e.g., ).\n\nSelenium Manager will report anonymised usage statistics to Plausible. This allows the Selenium team to understand more about how Selenium is being used so that we can better focus our development efforts. The data being collected is:\n\nSelenium Manager sends these data to Plausible once a day. This period is based on the TTL value (see configuration).\n\nData collection is on by default. To disable it, set the environment variable to . You may also disable data collection in the configuration file (see below) by setting .\n\nTL;DR: Selenium Manager should work silently and transparently for most users. Nevertheless, there are scenarios (e.g., to specify a custom cache path or setup globally a proxy) where custom configuration can be required.\n\nSelenium Manager is a CLI tool. Therefore, under the hood, the Selenium bindings call Selenium Manager by invoking shell commands. Like any other CLI tool, arguments can be used to specify specific capabilities in Selenium Manager. The different arguments supported by Selenium Manager can be checked by running the following command:\n\nIn addition to CLI arguments, Selenium Manager allows two additional mechanisms for configuration:\n• Configuration file. Selenium Manager uses a file called located in the Selenium cache (by default, at ) for custom configuration values. This TOML file contains a key-value collection used for custom configuration.\n• Environmental variables. Each configuration key has its equivalence in environmental variables by converting each key name to uppercase, replacing the dash symbol ( ) with an underscore ( ), and adding the prefix .\n\nThe configuration file is honored by Selenium Manager when it is present, and the corresponding CLI parameter is not specified. Besides, the environmental variables are used when neither of the previous options (CLI arguments and configuration file) is specified. In other words, the order of preference for Selenium Manager custom configuration is as follows:\n\nNotice that the Selenium bindings use the CLI arguments to specify configuration values, which in turn, are defined in each binding using browser options.\n\nThe following table summarizes all the supported arguments supported by Selenium Manager and their correspondence key in the configuration file and environment variables.\n\nIn addition to the configuration keys specified in the table before, there are some special cases, namely:\n• Browser version. In addition to , we can use the specific configuration keys to specify custom versions per supported browser. This way, the keys , , , etc., are supported. The same applies to environment variables (i.e., , , , etc.).\n• Driver version. Following the same pattern, we can use , , , etc. (in the configuration file), and , , , etc. (as environment variables).\n• Browser path. Following the same pattern, we can use , , , etc. (in the configuration file), and , , , etc. (as environment variables). The Selenium bindings also allow to specify a custom location of the browser path using options, namely: Chrome), Edge, or Firefox.\n• Driver mirror. Following the same pattern, we can use , , , etc. (in the configuration file), and , , , etc. (as environment variables).\n• Browser mirror. Following the same pattern, we can use , , , etc. (in the configuration file), and , , , etc. (as environment variables).\n\nTL;DR: The drivers and browsers managed by Selenium Manager are stored in a local folder ( ).\n\nThe cache in Selenium Manager is a local folder ( by default) in which the downloaded assets (drivers and browsers) are stored. For the sake of performance, when a driver or browser is already in the cache (i.e., there is a cache hint), Selenium Manager uses it from there.\n\nIn addition to the downloaded drivers and browsers, two additional files live in the cache’s root:\n• Configuration file ( ). This file is optional and, as explained in the previous section, allows to store custom configuration values for Selenium Manager. This file is maintained by the end-user and read by Selenium Manager.\n• Metadata file ( ). This file contains versions discovered by Selenium Manger making network requests (e.g., using the CfT JSON endpoints) and the time-to-live (TTL) in which they are valid. Selenium Manager automatically maintains this file.\n\nThe TTL in Selenium Manager is inspired by the TTL for DNS, a well-known mechanism that refers to how long some values are cached before they are automatically refreshed. In the case of Selenium Manager, these values are the versions found by making network requests for driver and browser version discovery. By default, the TTL is seconds (i.e., 1 hour) and can be tuned using configuration values or disabled by setting this configuration value to .\n\nThe TTL mechanism is a way to improve the overall performance of Selenium. It is based on the fact that the discovered driver and browser versions (e.g., the proper chromedriver version for Chrome 115 is 115.0.5790.170) will likely remain the same in the short term. Therefore, the discovered versions are written in the metadata file and read from there instead of making the same consecutive network request. This way, during the driver version discovery (step 2 of the automated driver management process previously introduced), Selenium Manager first reads the file metadata. When a fresh resolution (i.e., a driver/browser version valid during a TTL) is found, that version is used (saving some time in making a new network request). If not found or the TTL has expired, a network request is made, and the result is stored in the metadata file.\n\nLet’s consider an example. A Selenium binding asks Selenium Manager to resolve chromedriver. Selenium Manager detects that Chrome 115 is installed, so it makes a network request to the CfT endpoints to discover the proper chromedriver version (115.0.5790.170, at that moment). This version is stored in the metadata file and considered valid during the next hour (TTL). If Selenium Manager is asked to resolve chromedriver during that time (which is likely to happen in the execution of a test suite), the chromedriver version is discovered by reading the metadata file instead of making a new request to the CfT endpoints. After one hour, the chromedriver version stored in the cache will be considered as stale, and Selenium Manager will refresh it by making a new network request to the corresponding endpoint.\n\nSelenium Manager includes two additional arguments two handle the cache, namely:\n• : To remove the cache folder (equivalent to the environment variable ).\n• : To remove the metadata file (equivalent to the environment variable ).\n\nSelenium Manager follows the same versioning schema as Selenium. Nevertheless, we use the major version 0 for Selenium Manager releases because it is still in beta. For example, the Selenium Manager binaries shipped with Selenium 4.12.0 corresponds to version 0.4.12.\n\nFor most users, direct interaction with Selenium Manager is not required since the Selenium bindings use it internally. Nevertheless, if you want to play with Selenium Manager or use it for your use case involving driver or browser management, you can get the Selenium Manager binaries in different ways:\n• From the Selenium repository. The Selenium Manager source code is stored in the main Selenium repo under the folder rust. Moreover, you can find the compiled versions for Windows, Linux, and macOS in the Selenium Manager Artifacts repo. The stable Selenium Manager binaries (i.e., those distributed in the latest stable Selenium version) are linked in this file.\n• From the build workflow. Selenium Manager is compiled using a GitHub Actions workflow. This workflow creates binaries for Windows, Linux, and macOS. You can download these binaries from these workflow executions.\n• From the cache. As of version 4.15.0 of the Selenium Java bindings, the Selenium Manager binary is extracted and copied to the cache folder. For instance, the Selenium Manager binary shipped with Selenium 4.15.0 is stored in the folder ).\n\nLet’s consider a typical example: we want to manage chromedriver automatically. For that, we invoke Selenium Manager as follows (notice that the flag is optional, but it helps us to understand what Selenium Manager is doing):\n\nIn this case, the local Chrome (in Windows) is detected by Selenium Manager. Then, using its version and the CfT endpoints, the proper chromedriver version (115, in this example) is downloaded to the local cache. Finally, Selenium Manager provides two results: i) the driver path (downloaded) and ii) the browser path (local).\n\nLet’s consider another example. Now we want to use Chrome beta. Therefore, we invoke Selenium Manager specifying that version label as follows (notice that the CfT beta is discovered, downloaded, and stored in the local cache):\n\nSelenium Manager allows you to configure the drivers automatically when setting up Selenium Grid. To that aim, you need to include the argument in the command to start Selenium Grid. For more details, visit the Selenium Grid starting page.\n\nMoreover, Selenium Manager also allows managing Selenium Grid releases automatically. For that, the argument is used as follows:\n\nAfter this command, Selenium Manager discovers the latest version of Selenium Grid, storing the in the local cache.\n\nOptionally, the argument allows to specify a Selenium Grid version ( ).\n\nSelenium Manager requests remote endpoints (like Chrome for Testing (CfT), among others) to discover and download drivers and browsers from online repositories. When this operation is done in a corporate environment with a proxy or firewall, it might lead to connectivity problems like the following:\n\nWhen that happens, consider the following solutions:\n• Use the proxy capabilities of Selenium (see documentation). Alternatively, use the environment variable to set the proxy URL or use the configuration file (see configuration).\n• Review your network setup to enable the remote requests and downloads required by Selenium Manager.\n\nIf you are using a Linux package manager (Anaconda, snap, etc) that requires a specific driver be used for your browsers, you’ll need to either specify the driver location, the browser location, or both, depending on the requirements.\n\nSelenium supports all five architectures managed by Google’s Chrome for Testing, and all six drivers provided for Microsoft Edge.\n\nEach release of the Selenium bindings comes with three separate Selenium Manager binaries — one for Linux, Windows, and Mac.\n• The Mac version supports both x64 and aarch64 (Intel and Apple).\n• The Windows version should work for both x86 and x64 (32-bit and 64-bit OS).\n• The Linux version has only been verified to work for x64.\n\nReasons for not supporting more architectures:\n• Neither Chrome for Testing nor Microsoft Edge supports additional architectures, so Selenium Manager would need to manage something unofficial for it to work.\n• We currently build the binaries from existing GitHub actions runners, which do not support these architectures\n• Any additional architectures would get distributed with all Selenium releases, increasing the total build size\n\nIf you are running Linux on arm64/aarch64, 32-bit architecture, or a Raspberry Pi, Selenium Manager will not work for you. The biggest issue for people is that they used to get custom-built drivers and put them on PATH and have them work. Now that Selenium Manager is responsible for locating drivers on PATH, this approach no longer works, and users need to use a class and set the location directly. There are a number of advantages to having Selenium Manager look for drivers on PATH instead of managing that logic in each of the bindings, so that’s currently a trade-off we are comfortable with.\n\nHowever, as of Selenium 4.13.0, the Selenium bindings allow locating the Selenium Manager binary using an environment variable called . If this variable is set, the bindings will use its value as the Selenium Manager path in the local filesystem. This feature will allow users to provide a custom compilation of Selenium Manager, for instance, if the default binaries (compiled for Windows, Linux, and macOS) are incompatible with a given system (e.g., ARM64 in Linux).\n\nWhen automatically managing browsers in Linux, Selenium Manager relies on the releases published by the browser vendors (i.e., Chrome, Firefox, and Edge). These releases are portable in most cases. Nevertheless, there might be cases in which existing libraries are required. In Linux, this problem might be experienced when trying to run Firefox, e.g., as follows:\n\nIf that happens, the solution is to install that library, for instance, as follows:\n\nA similar issue might happen when trying to execute Chrome for Testing in Linux:\n\nIn this case, the library to be installed is the following:\n\nUsing an environment variable for the driver path\n\nIt’s possible to use an environment variable to specify the driver path without using Selenium Manager. The following environment variables are supported:\n\nFor example, to specify the path to the chromedriver, you can set the environment variable to the path of the chromedriver executable. The following bindings allow you to specify the driver path using an environment variable:\n\nThis feature is available in the Selenium Ruby binding starting from version 4.25.0 and in the Python binding from version 4.26.0.\n\nIn order to build your own custom Selenium Manager that works in an architecture we don’t currently support, you can utilize the following steps:\n• Set the following environment variable for the driver path\n• Put the driver you want in a location on your system PATH\n• Selenium will now use the built Selenium Manager to locate the manually downloaded driver on PATH\n\nYou can trace the work in progress in the Selenium Manager project dashboard. Moreover, you can check the new features shipped with each Selenium Manager release in its changelog file."
