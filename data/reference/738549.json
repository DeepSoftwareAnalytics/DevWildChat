For the sake of simplicity and maintainability, you want as few things to sit between the user's mouse-click and the actual method being executed.\n\nYou can store the object in the 's property and then reference it in the Click event handler, but that results in code that's got some inherent weak points:\n\nThat's a lot of casting and null-reference checking. And the really weak thing about this code is that if it turns out that is null, or contains something other than a object, you don't really know where to look to find out where the problem is occurring.\n\nContrast it with code like this:\n\nWhen you're maintaining this code, you don't know how that method is implemented, but at least you know where to look for it - in . And when you do, you'll see something like this:\n\nWell, that's interesting. Following the thread, how does that dictionary get populated? You find that in another method in MyClass:\n\nThis approach solves a number of problems: it gives you a simple way of handling the 's Click event properly, which is what you asked for. But it also isolates the not-always-trivial process of creating the in the first place. It reduces the amount of code you'll have to move around if you refactor your form and move the to another form. And it reduces the number of things that your form class needs to know about, which is generally a good thing.\n\nAlso, it's testable. Generally, the only way to test code in a UI event handler is through the UI. This approach lets you isolate all of the logic surrounding this part of the UI in something that you can unit test; the only thing you can't write a unit test for is a single line of code in the form.\n\nI should point out that the other approach people have been suggesting - subclassing - is perfectly fine too. You put the logic I put in the method in the class's constructor, make the instance a private property of the class, and expose a Click method that calls the method of . Pretty much the only reason I don't like it is that it still leaves you with a fair amount of code in your form that you can't really unit test:"

        "document": "Best Practices for Implementing the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern\n\nThe Event-based Asynchronous Pattern provides you with an effective way to expose asynchronous behavior in classes, with familiar event and delegate semantics. To implement Event-based Asynchronous Pattern, you need to follow some specific behavioral requirements. The following sections describe requirements and guidelines you should consider when you implement a class that follows the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern.\n\nFor an overview, see Implementing the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern.\n\nIf you implement the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern, you must provide a number of guarantees to ensure that your class will behave properly and clients of your class can rely on such behavior.\n\nAlways invoke the MethodNameCompleted event handler when you have successful completion, an error, or a cancellation. Applications should never encounter a situation where they remain idle and completion never occurs. One exception to this rule is if the asynchronous operation itself is designed so that it never completes.\n\nFor each separate MethodNameAsync method, apply the following design requirements:\n• None Define a MethodNameCompleted event on the same class as the method.\n• None Define an EventArgs class and accompanying delegate for the MethodNameCompleted event that derives from the AsyncCompletedEventArgs class. The default class name should be of the form MethodNameCompletedEventArgs.\n• None Ensure that the EventArgs class is specific to the return values of the MethodName method. When you use the EventArgs class, you should never require developers to cast the result. The following code example shows good and bad implementation of this design requirement respectively.\n• None Do not define an EventArgs class for returning methods that return . Instead, use an instance of the AsyncCompletedEventArgs class.\n• None Ensure that you always raise the MethodNameCompleted event. This event should be raised on successful completion, on an error, or on cancellation. Applications should never encounter a situation where they remain idle and completion never occurs.\n• None Ensure that you catch any exceptions that occur in the asynchronous operation and assign the caught exception to the Error property.\n• None If there was an error completing the task, the results should not be accessible. When the Error property is not , ensure that accessing any property in the EventArgs structure raises an exception. Use the RaiseExceptionIfNecessary method to perform this verification.\n• None Model a time out as an error. When a time out occurs, raise the MethodNameCompleted event and assign a TimeoutException to the Error property.\n• None If your class supports multiple concurrent invocations, ensure that the MethodNameCompleted event contains the appropriate object.\n• None Ensure that the MethodNameCompleted event is raised on the appropriate thread and at the appropriate time in the application lifecycle. For more information, see the Threading and Contexts section.\n• None If your class supports multiple concurrent invocations, enable the developer to track each invocation separately by defining the MethodNameAsync overload that takes an object-valued state parameter, or task ID, called . This parameter should always be the last parameter in the MethodNameAsync method's signature.\n• None If your class defines the MethodNameAsync overload that takes an object-valued state parameter, or task ID, be sure to track the lifetime of the operation with that task ID, and be sure to provide it back into the completion handler. There are helper classes available to assist. For more information on concurrency management, see How to: Implement a Component That Supports the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern.\n• None If your class defines the MethodNameAsync method without the state parameter, and it does not support multiple concurrent invocations, ensure that any attempt to invoke MethodNameAsync before the prior MethodNameAsync invocation has completed raises an InvalidOperationException.\n• None In general, do not raise an exception if the MethodNameAsync method without the parameter is invoked multiple times so that there are multiple outstanding operations. You can raise an exception when your class explicitly cannot handle that situation, but assume that developers can handle these multiple indistinguishable callbacks\n• None If there was an error during execution of the asynchronous operation, the results should not be accessible. Ensure that accessing any property in the AsyncCompletedEventArgs when Error is not raises the exception referenced by Error. The AsyncCompletedEventArgs class provides the RaiseExceptionIfNecessary method for this purpose.\n• None Ensure that any attempt to access the result raises an InvalidOperationException stating that the operation was canceled. Use the AsyncCompletedEventArgs.RaiseExceptionIfNecessary method to perform this verification.\n• None Support progress reporting, if possible. This enables developers to provide a better application user experience when they use your class.\n• None If you implement a ProgressChanged or MethodNameProgressChanged event, ensure that there are no such events raised for a particular asynchronous operation after that operation's MethodNameCompleted event has been raised.\n• None If the standard ProgressChangedEventArgs is being populated, ensure that the ProgressPercentage can always be interpreted as a percentage. The percentage does not need to be accurate, but it should represent a percentage. If your progress reporting metric must be something other than a percentage, derive a class from the ProgressChangedEventArgs class and leave ProgressPercentage at 0. Avoid using a reporting metric other than a percentage.\n• None Ensure that the event is raised on the appropriate thread and at the appropriate time in the application lifecycle. For more information, see the Threading and Contexts section.\n• None Do not expose an property if your class supports multiple concurrent invocations. For example, XML Web service proxies do not expose an property because they support multiple concurrent invocations of asynchronous methods.\n• None The property should return after the MethodNameAsync method has been called and before the MethodNameCompleted event has been raised. Otherwise it should return . The BackgroundWorker and WebClient components are examples of classes that expose an property.\n• None Support cancellation, if possible. This enables developers to provide a better application user experience when they use your class.\n• None In the case of cancellation, set the Cancelled flag in the AsyncCompletedEventArgs object.\n• None Ensure that any attempt to access the result raises an InvalidOperationException stating that the operation was canceled. Use the AsyncCompletedEventArgs.RaiseExceptionIfNecessary method to perform this verification.\n• None Ensure that calls to a cancellation method always return successfully, and never raise an exception. In general, a client is not notified as to whether an operation is truly cancelable at any given time, and is not notified as to whether a previously issued cancellation has succeeded. However, the application will always be given notification when a cancellation succeeded, because the application takes part in the completion status.\n• None Raise the MethodNameCompleted event when the operation is canceled.\n• Catch any exceptions that occur in the asynchronous operation and set the value of the AsyncCompletedEventArgs.Error property to that exception.\n\nFor correct operation of your class, it is critical that the client's event handlers are invoked on the proper thread or context for the given application model, including ASP.NET and Windows Forms applications. Two important helper classes are provided to ensure that your asynchronous class behaves correctly under any application model: AsyncOperation and AsyncOperationManager.\n\nAsyncOperationManager provides one method, CreateOperation, which returns an AsyncOperation. Your MethodNameAsync method calls CreateOperation and your class uses the returned AsyncOperation to track the lifetime of the asynchronous task.\n\nTo report progress, incremental results, and completion to the client, call the Post and OperationCompleted methods on the AsyncOperation. AsyncOperation is responsible for marshalling calls to the client's event handlers to the proper thread or context.\n\nYou can circumvent these rules if you explicitly want to go against the policy of the application model, but still benefit from the other advantages of using the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern. For example, you may want a class operating in Windows Forms to be free threaded. You can create a free threaded class, as long as developers understand the implied restrictions. Console applications do not synchronize the execution of Post calls. This can cause events to be raised out of order. If you wish to have serialized execution of Post calls, implement and install a System.Threading.SynchronizationContext class.\n\nFor more information about using AsyncOperation and AsyncOperationManager to enable your asynchronous operations, see How to: Implement a Component That Supports the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern.\n• None Ideally, each method invocation should be independent of others. You should avoid coupling invocations with shared resources. If resources are to be shared among invocations, you will need to provide a proper synchronization mechanism in your implementation.\n• None Designs that require the client to implement synchronization are discouraged. For example, you could have an asynchronous method that receives a global static object as a parameter; multiple concurrent invocations of such a method could result in data corruption or deadlocks.\n• None If you implement a method with the multiple-invocation overload ( in the signature), your class will need to manage a collection of user states, or task IDs, and their corresponding pending operations. This collection should be protected with regions, because the various invocations add and remove objects in the collection.\n• None Consider reusing classes where feasible and appropriate. In this case, the naming is not consistent with the method name, because a given delegate and EventArgs type are not tied to a single method. However, forcing developers to cast the value retrieved from a property on the EventArgs is never acceptable.\n• None If you are authoring a class that derives from Component, do not implement and install your own SynchronizationContext class. Application models, not components, control the SynchronizationContext that is used.\n• None When you use multithreading of any sort, you potentially expose yourself to very serious and complex bugs. Before implementing any solution that uses multithreading, see Managed Threading Best Practices.\n• Deciding When to Implement the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern\n• Best Practices for Implementing the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern\n• How to: Use Components That Support the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern\n• How to: Implement a Component That Supports the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern"

        "document": "There are a lot of moving parts that may affect the success of your C# project. For example, what if you didn’t allocate time for managing technical debt? Better be ready to do a substantial rewrite just to untangle those dependencies. Maybe you closed your eyes to poor code quality? Well, say “hi” to unexpected bugs, security vulnerabilities, and increased maintenance costs. Was there slack on performance optimization? Then welcome to slow app response times and dissatisfied customers. All of these headaches could be, and should be, easily averted with a comprehensive code review process in place.\n\nIn this article, we’ll walk you through the essential processes of conducting an in-depth code review for a C# project. By following this Redwerk-approved checklist, you can ensure that your codebase remains clean, efficient, and future-proof.\n\nIn C# applications, verifying functionality means that you’re confirming the software implements the required features correctly, and interacts as expected.

        "document": "The following code example creates a ListView control with three ListViewItem objects specified and three ListViewItem.ListViewSubItem objects specified for each item. The example also creates ColumnHeader objects to display the subitems in details view. Two ImageList objects are also created in the code example to provide images for the ListViewItem objects. These ImageList objects are added to the LargeImageList and SmallImageList properties. The example uses the following properties in creating the ListView control:\n\nThis example requires that you have added the code to a Form and call the method created in the example from the constructor or another method on the form. The example also requires that images named , , , and are located in the root directory of drive C.\n\nA ListView control allows you to display a list of items with item text and, optionally, an icon to identify the type of item. For example, the Windows Explorer list of files is similar in appearance to a ListView control. It displays a list of the files and folders currently selected in the tree. Each file and folder displays an icon associated with it to help identify the type of file or folder. The ListViewItem class represents an item within a ListView control. The items that are displayed in the list can be shown in one of five different views. Items can be displayed as large icons, as small icons, or as small icons in a vertical list. Items can also have subitems which contain information that is related to the parent item. The details view allows you to display the item and its subitems in a grid with column headers that identify the information being displayed in a subitem. The tile view, which has limited availability as described below, allows you to display the item and its subitems as a tile that contains a large icon next to the textual information. ListView supports single or multiple selection. The multiple selection feature lets the user select from a list of items in a way similar to a ListBox control. Additionally, the user can activate selected items to perform a task. For example, you could use a ListView control to display a list of files that the application can then open and utilize. The user can select the files to open and then double-click them to activate the items and open the files in the application. The ListView can also display check boxes, using the CheckBoxes property, to allow the user to check the items that they want to perform an action on. You can use the ListView control in a variety of ways. The control can be used to display information from an application, a database, or a text file. The ListView can also be used to obtain information from the user, such as selecting a set of files to process.\n\nListView provides a large number of properties that provide flexibility in appearance and behavior. The View property allows you to change the way in which items are displayed. The LargeImageList, SmallImageList, and StateImageList properties allow you to specify the ImageList objects that contain the images displayed for items and, in the case of the StateImageList, the check boxes that are displayed when the CheckBoxes property is set to . To determine which items are checked, you can use the CheckedItems property to access the ListView.CheckedListViewItemCollection collection. The Columns property allows access to the ListView.ColumnHeaderCollection, which stores the column headers that are displayed when the View property of the control is set to Details. Items are added and removed from the ListView through the Items property. The Items property allows you to access the ListView.ListViewItemCollection of the control, which provides methods for manipulating the items in the control. If you want to allow the user to edit the text of an item, you can use the LabelEdit property. When your control contains a large number of items, it is often easier for the user to see them in a sorted list. You can use the Sorting property to sort the items alphabetically. You can also completely customize the appearance of a ListView control. To do this, set the OwnerDraw property to and handle one or more of the following events: DrawItem, DrawSubItem, DrawColumnHeader.\n\nMany of the properties of the ListView control are used when the View property of the control is set to Details. The AllowColumnReorder property allows the user of your ListView control to reconfigure the order of columns at run time. The FullRowSelect property allows an item and its subitems to be selected instead of just the item. To display gridlines in the details view to identify the boundaries of items and subitems in the ListView, you can use the GridLines property. The HeaderStyle property allows you to specify the type of column headers to display.\n\nA ListView control can operate in virtual mode, where ListViewItem objects are generated dynamically instead of being stored in the Items collection. This can be useful for dealing with very large lists or lists whose contents frequently change. To enable Virtual mode, set the VirtualMode property to and handle the RetrieveVirtualItem, CacheVirtualItems, and SearchForVirtualItem events.\n\nIn addition to the many properties that are available for a ListView control, there are methods and events that your application can use to provide additional capabilities to the ListView. The BeginUpdate and EndUpdate methods allow you to improve performance when you add many items to a ListView by preventing the control from repainting every time that an item is added. If your ListView control is displaying items and subitems, you may want to provide functionality when the user right-clicks a subitem. To determine the item whose subitem is being clicked, you can use the GetItemAt method. When performing validation of the items after the user has edited them, you may want to display a specific item to the user to change. The EnsureVisible method can be called to ensure that the specific item is in the visible area of the control.\n\nIf the LabelEdit property set to , you can perform tasks such as validating the text being edited before and after the text changed by creating an event handler for the BeforeLabelEdit and AfterLabelEdit events. To perform tasks such as opening a file or displaying a dialog box to edit an item displayed in a ListView, you can create an event handler for the ItemActivate event. If you allow the user to sort the items in a ListView when they click a column header, you can create an event handler for the ColumnClick event to perform the sorting. When the CheckBoxes property is set to , you can determine when a change in an item's check state has occurred by handling the ItemCheck event.\n\nYou can also set a background image for the ListView with the BackgroundImage property. Your application must have the STAThreadAttribute on its method to correctly display the background image for the ListView control. In addition, if a ListView control with a background image is hosted in Internet Explorer, specify comctl32.dll version 6.0 as a dependent assembly in the application manifest file to ensure the background image is properly displayed.\n\nWindows XP and Windows Server 2003 provide three features that enhance the ListView control when your application calls the Application.EnableVisualStyles method: tile view, grouping, and the insertion mark.\n\nThe tile view lets you balance graphical and textual information by displaying item and subitem text next to large icons. Set the View property to View.Tile to enable this behavior.\n\nThe grouping feature lets you visually group items into related categories. Use the Groups property to add ListViewGroup objects to the ListView control when you want to enable this feature. To temporarily disable the feature, set the ShowGroups property to .\n\nThe insertion mark feature lets you provide drag-and-drop item repositioning with visual feedback to indicate drop locations. Use the ListViewInsertionMark object retrieved through the InsertionMark property to display the insertion mark.\n\nThese features are available only under Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. On earlier operating systems, the code that relate to these features has no effect, the tile view appears as the large icon view, and the insertion mark and groups do not display. In some cases, you might want to include code that determines whether these features are available, and provide alternate functionality when they are unavailable. These features are provided by the same library that provides the operating system themes feature. To check for the availability of this library, call the FeatureSupport.IsPresent(Object) method overload and pass in the OSFeature.Themes value.\n\nThe following table shows some of the ListView members and the views they are valid in."
