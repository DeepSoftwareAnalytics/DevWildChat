So here's my question: How do they do it? Both the execution in SFM and the planning. How do you know which way to move the head? How do you make a convincing idle body? Again, both the theory and how one would achieve in in SFM."

Because the SFM uses the same assets as the game, anything that exists in the game can be used in the movie, and vice versa. By utilizing the hardware rendering power of a modern gaming PC, the SFM allows storytellers to work in a what-you-see-is-what-you-get environment so they can iterate in the context of what it will feel like for the final audience."
