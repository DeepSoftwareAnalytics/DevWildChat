        "document": "Struggling with the Fibonacci sequence in C#? Need a detailed, comprehensive guide to walk you through it? You’re at the right place! We’ll unravel the intricate world of Fibonacci in C#, studying its various facets, from the basic understanding to its practical applications and performances tweaks. Ready to dive right in?\n\nWhat’s all this fuss about the Fibonacci series, you ask? Why should you care, particularly as a C# developer?\n\nWhat Is The Fibonacci Series?\n\nThe Fibonacci series is an arithmetic sequence Commencing with 0 and 1, the subsequent numbers in the series are formed by adding the preceding two. So, it goes like 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on. Named after Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, more fondly known as Fibonacci, this sequence isn’t mere math wizardry – it’s intricately entwined with nature and aesthetics.\n\nBut you’re here for the coding part, right? Let’s get to it!\n\nThe underlying formula for any number n in the Fibonacci sequence is a recurrence relation:\n\nSimple enough, huh? Let’s decipher this formula in C# terms and solve this puzzle together.\n\nWhat does it mean? Let’s say is a box. This box is the new number you get in the Fibonacci sequence. But here’s the thing. You only get what’s in this box (meaning you only get the new number), if you add what’s inside the two preceding boxes ( and ).\n\nIf you’ve missed that, here’s an easier explanation. Suppose you have an empty box . You have been told to fill this box with some candy. But how many candies to put inside it? You look at the boxes that came before it – the box and the box . You count the candies inside them and put the same total amount of candy in your new box . That’s pretty much the formula. Each new box amount (or each new number in the sequence) is just the total of the candy (or the total of the numbers) from the previous two boxes.\n\nIn programming, understanding the principles behind the code can add depth to your knowledge. With C#, Fibonacci sequence generation becomes a playground of algorithms and problem-solving techniques. Let’s dive in to see how we can programmatically generate this magical sequence!\n\nIn generating the Fibonacci sequence using C#, it all boils down to understanding the mechanics behind the sequence itself. A Fibonacci sequence is formed by adding the two preceding numbers to generate the next one. An easy peasy lemon squeezy concept, right? Let’s see the basic Fibonacci C# code:\n\nThis function, , is the heart of our Fibonacci sequence generator. If is less than 2, it means we’re just at the very beginning of the sequence (where values are 0 and 1), so we return as it is. For any greater than 1, the method calls itself twice, with the arguments and . The results of these two recursive calls are added together, producing the -th Fibonacci number.\n\nCool, right? Now you have a Fibonacci sequence generator right in your code editor! But isn’t recursion a bit of a slowcoach? It’s time to address this turtle in the room and see how we can spitball this code into a speed demon.\n\nRemember that one kid in the class that always did things differently but still got the job done? That’s iteration for you! It hosts an alternative approach to recursion when it comes to generating a Fibonacci sequence. Let’s put this iteration approach into action and see how we can tweak our previous function:\n\nFor every iteration in this loop, we’re essentially doing three things:\n• We store the value of in (which holds the current Fibonacci number).\n• We assign the next number in the sequence ( ) to .\n• We calculate and store the newest Fibonacci number in by summing up the old values of and .\n\nAt the end of the loop, contains the -th Fibonacci number, which we duly return. Now, we’ve got a super-efficient and memory-friendly way to generate the Fibonacci sequence!\n\nRemember, in the programming world, there’s no one-size-fits-all. If you’re looking for raw speed and aren’t overly concerned with memory, use iteration. If memory efficiency is key, and you’re okay with some extra computation, recursion is the way to go.\n\nSome may call it ‘memoization,’ others may call it ‘caching’ — it doesn’t matter! This simple yet powerful technique can be a gamechanger when it comes to calculating Fibonacci numbers, especially for larger inputs.\n\nWhy? Because recursive or iterative methods tend to do a lot of repetitive work when calculating higher Fibonacci values (i.e., calculating the same Fibonacci numbers again and again).\n\nLet’s see how we can utilize dynamic programming to make our Fibonacci generator faster:\n\nIn this function, we’re caching previously calculated Fibonacci numbers using a dictionary . Whenever a Fibonacci number is to be calculated, we first check whether we’ve already calculated it. If yes, we simply return it from the dictionary. If not, we calculate it recursively (as we did earlier), store it in the dictionary for future reference, and then return it.\n\nHence, we’re avoiding unnecessary calculations, which makes our function faster, especially for large inputs!\n\nNo wonder Santa makes a list and checks it twice. It saves him a lot of work, just like our function does by checking its dictionary!\n\nDeveloping a simple Fibonacci sequence in C# involves using a for loop to iteratively generate the sequence. Here’s a quick glance at how you could do it:\n\nThis method receives an integer parameter , representing how many numbers from the sequence you want to print. It uses two helper variables, and , to generate the next Fibonacci numbers.\n\nEver wondered about the relation between Fibonacci series and .NET? As a .NET developer, understanding this link and mastering its implementation can greatly benefit you.\n\nThe .NET framework provides us with a powerful toolset to implement complex mathematical sequences like Fibonacci. From using basic recursion strategies to more advanced parallel computing and caching techniques, .NET is your trusty arsenal for efficient Fibonacci sequence computation.\n\nStay with me; the real action is yet to unfold!\n\nDiving Deeper into Fibonacci Series in C#\n\nDipping your toes into the pool and getting a feel of cool recursion waves is nice, but completely diving in gives an exhilarating experience! Let’s take the plunge together and get a hang of some advanced Fibonacci jargon.\n\nThe highlights of this recursion show are increasing simplicity and decreasing redundancies. We already saw the basic idea behind Recursive function in C#. Now, let’s look at a little more complex but efficient implementation. Can a function remain its own oracle? Let’s find out:\n\nThis method uses recursion to calculate the th Fibonacci number. For each greater than one, it recursively calls the method twice, simulating our ‘n = (n – 1) + (n – 2)’ Fibonacci relation. Despite its simplicity, it’s not efficient for large inputs due to its high overhead of redundant computations. It’s like repeatedly calculating the sum of 2 + 2 for different arithmetic operations.\n\nBut don’t lose heart! We have an ace up our sleeves: memoization and tail recursion. These strategies will boost your function’s performance and make it ready for larger Fibonacci tangoes. Let’s take the plunge!\n\nAdvanced Fibonacci Series in C# Using Recursion\n\nStoring previous results to avoid re-calculations (memoization) and reducing the function’s memory footprint and potential stack overflow risk (tail recursion) are two great tools for creating an optimal Fibonacci recursion function in C#.\n\nMeet Memoization, the superhero that saves the day by storing the results of expensive recursive function calls and reusing them when needed. Here’s how we can bring it into play:\n\nIn this function, we employ an array to store previously calculated Fibonacci numbers. This little trick drastically reduces the time complexity as it bypasses redundant calculations.\n\nNext in our toolbox is Tail Recursion, where the recursive call is the last operation in the function. This technique allows some compilers or interpreters to optimize away the creation of a new stack frame as we can reuse the current stack frame for the recursive call.\n\nThis function’s tail recursive nature lies in the fact that the recursive call is the last operation performed in the function. As a result, the function’s call stack remains constant, making the method very space-efficient.\n\nPractical Applications of Fibonacci Net in C#\n\nGot your head around the Fibonacci sequence and its implementation in C#? Great! But you might be wondering: how does this help me in practical terms? Why should I, as a developer, bother learning this? Truth is, the Fibonacci sequence holds fascinating applications across a spectrum of real-world scenarios in computing.\n\nFibonacci sequences are often found in computer graphics and image effects algorithms for their efficiency and aesthetic properties. For instance, in creating spirals, a key element in Nature-inspired design or procedural generation of flora in games:\n\nThis function draws a set of Fibonacci spirals, useful in simulating attractive natural phenomena like the growth of plants, the formation of galaxies, and more. This application can significantly boost your graphic design or game development projects.\n\nAnother prevalent use of the Fibonacci sequence is in the implementation of Fibonacci Heaps, a data structure for priority queue operations. These find widespread usage in network design, operations research, and resource allocation problems.\n\nAbove is a rudimentary initiation of a binomial heap – an advanced topic, indeed, but one where the Fibonacci series plays a crucial role. If you find yourself working in systems or networking, understanding this application can prove quite beneficial.\n\nEver thought of how those ‘old-timey’ 8-bit video games managed to show a range of colors with a limited palette? The secret is a method called dithering, and Fibonacci plays a pivotal role in some algorithms:\n\nThe code above showcases a simplified version of a dithering algorithm using a Fibonacci-like error diffusion. For each pixel, it diffuses the error (difference between the intended and actual color value) to the following two pixels in a 3:3 ratio, akin to the Fibonacci numbers 1:2.\n\nThese examples are just the tip of the iceberg concerning the practical applications of the Fibonacci sequence, particularly in .NET. From animations and image processing to even obscure use-cases like lossless data compression and cryptography, the Fibonacci sequence, implemented in C#, can be a trusty tool in your toolbox.\n\nImproving the Performance of Fibonacci C# Code\n\nHigh-performing algorithms are at the heart of efficient coding. Who doesn’t like snappy, responsive applications? To that end, one of the biggest culprits hampering your C# program can be inefficiently computed Fibonacci sequences.\n\nLet’s delve deeper into top performance best practices in the world of Fibonacci calculations.\n\nThe performance of our Fibonacci number calculations normally depends on two critical factors, which are:\n• Time complexity: This is the computational complexity that describes the amount of processing time an algorithm takes.\n• Space complexity: This is the amount of working storage space/memory needed by an algorithm to process the data and produce a result.\n\nIn the case of basic Fibonacci implementation in C#, both time and space complexity are quite high. Recursive methods, although cleaner in code form, can have an exorbitant time complexity, especially for larger numbers. This is due to redundant calculations being performed multiple times for lower Fibonacci numbers.\n\nQuick tip: Using .NET’s class, you can easily measure and compare the execution times of different methods!\n\nOne cool way to enhance your Fibonacci function’s performance is by using a technique called ‘Memoization’. Memoization involves storing the results of complex function calls and reusing them when needed, without reperforming the entire calculation.\n\nHave a look at this improved Fibonacci calculator using memoization:\n\nIn this code, is our storehouse of computed Fibonacci numbers. When is called, it first checks if we have the requested Fibonacci number at hand (in the dictionary). If it’s there, it throws it back right away. Else, it calculates these, stores them for future sightings, and then returns the value.\n\nIn this improved version of Fibonacci calculator, the time complexity has been finely tuned and reduced. In the initial method, Fibonacci of any number had a time complexity of O(2^n), which fits into an ‘exponential time complexity’ category. Very performance-friendly, isn’t it?\n\nBut using memoization, our new Fibonacci calculator now has a time complexity of O(n), which is drastically better!\n\nHere’s a simple illustration. Imagine trying to find the 20th Fibonacci number using both methods:\n• The initial one will require approximately 2^20 or about 1,048,576 computations!\n• The revised one will need a mere 20 computations!\n\nIf you’re looking to amp up your Fibonacci calculator even further, why not harness the power of parallel processing? Using .NET’s built-in classes like , you can split the workload between your system’s cores, making calculations even faster!\n\nIn this example, we are asynchronously splitting the responsibility of calculating and between two tasks. We then wait for both tasks to be finished, add their results, cache it, and return the result.\n\nAs we delve deeper into C# Fibonacci recursion, now is the perfect time to learn about optimizing our recursive functions. Consider this section like a careful walk through a winding path, where we will explore each turn thoughtfully.\n\nTo enhance the efficiency of our recursive functions, we focus on two crucial aspects—resilient base conditions and well-strategized recursive calls. Remember, efficient base cases prevent unnecessary recursive calls, thereby optimizing our function’s performance.\n\nLet’s try to light this up first with recursion using memoization. Memoization is an optimization technique that speeds up applications by storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again.\n\nIn this code snippet, we are creating a dictionary to store already computed Fibonacci numbers. This approach prevents our method from performing redundant calculations by storing previously calculated results. We significantly increase our function’s performance and reduce its time complexity from exponential to linear.\n\nNow, let’s venture into another significant performance optimization technique, fast doubling. Fast doubling is an optimization concept that expedites Fibonacci calculations and improves run-time complexity.\n\nThe above function may look slightly complex, but bear with me! This function computes the nth and (n+1)th Fibonacci numbers simultaneously. Here, is a bitwise operation signifying that the value of b is shifted one place to the left, equivalent to multiplying b by 2. We also use bitwise AND to check if the number is odd.\n\nStep by step, we are calculating , , , and , each of which is a vital piece of the puzzle in determining the Fibonacci numbers. Essentially, we split the problem into two halves and recursively calculate the partial solutions. This approach amplifies our calculation efficiency and reduces the time complexity to a logarithmic order—a considerable performance enhancement!\n\nOptimization and performance enhancement isn’t limited to the code’s mechanics. Sometimes, understanding the infrastructure that our software is running on can give us a significant performance boost. For example, utilizing parallel computing capabilities of multicore processors using Parallel.For in C# can supercharge the computation of larger Fibonacci sequences, particularly on server-grade hardware.\n\nThe Pros and Cons of Fibonacci Sequence Recursion\n\nHere’s a good news-bad news angle on Fibonacci recursion. Don’t fret; nothing too extreme. Let’s break it down!\n\nRecursion, although notorious for its intricacy, can be a silver bullet in certain scenarios. Here’s a taste of recursion’s helpful side:\n• Simplicity: Recursion breaks down the problem into solvable chunks, making complex problems look less daunting. Take our recursive Fibonacci function; it’s surprisingly straightforward, isn’t it?\n\nThis function reduces the problem to 2 smaller subproblems. We continue this trend until we reach the base case, allowing for a clean solution.\n• Code Readability: Recursive implementations often result in cleaner, more readable code. The control flows naturally as the recursion unfolds, making for snappier bug fixing, quicker iterations, and joyful reading.\n• Problem Suitability: Some problems naturally lend themselves to recursion. Fibonacci is such a problem. By mapping directly on the mathematical definition, the recursive solution looks virtually identical to the mathematical formula!\n\nEvery rose has its thorns, right? Now let’s examine the recursive rose’s thorns:\n• Performance: Recursion can deteriorate performance, especially in languages that don’t natively support tail recursion, like C#. Each recursive call adds a new layer to the call stack, damaging both memory and time efficiency.\n\nIn this code snippet, each function call creates two new calls. The entire Fibonacci sequence is calculated twice, leading to an exponential time complexity. Imagine this on a large scale – chaos!\n• Risk of Stack Overflow: The more recursive the code, the deeper the call stack, the higher the chance of a stack overflow. Imagine your digital dominos toppling over!\n\nHowever, keep in mind that every con has a workaround. Adopt smart strategies, like adding memoization, tail recursion, or even switching to iterative solutions when necessary, and you’ll lessen, if not completely eliminate, these drawbacks.\n\nConcluding Thoughts on Fibonacci in C#\n\nAnd there you have it!

        "document": "We will look at possible solutions for generating the Fibonacci sequence in C#.\n\nFibonacci is a number sequence that starts with 0, 1, 1 and then the following number is the addition of the two preceding numbers:\n\nWe will also look into the keyword and how to use it to generate the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nYou will see how you can use the most popular benchmarking library, BenchmarkDotNet, to observe the performance of a given solution and compare it to other solutions.\n\nAll solutions can be found on the following GitHub repository. I have been using Visual Studio 2022, but in general, you should be able also to use any .NET C# IDE of your choice.\n\nI encourage you to develop your solutions and challenge the ones I listed here. The goal is to play with the different mechanics C# offers you to find other solutions to this problem.\n\nThe solution is just two nested for-loops, where the outer loop iterates until the desired is reached. The inner loop iterates backwards, starting at the current index ( ) and ending at the index that is two places before it. This adds the last two numbers in the list together and stores the result in the variable.\n\nThe second solution only differs in terms of its inner loop. is used.\n\nThe third solution makes use of the and Methods.\n\nThe idea is to reverse the list and skip the first or second item.\n\nSolution 4 is slightly different. It doesn’t reverse the list. Instead, it uses the to skip the desired number of items.\n\nSolution 5 is almost the same as four. It reduced the number of variables but made the code a bit harder to read.\n\nSolution 6: Trying Something Different – Yield (1)\n\nUsing feels like magic if it is not yet part of your toolbox.\n\nIn the example provided, the method is an iterator method that returns an . It uses the return statement to yield a sequence of integers to the caller.\n\nAs you see, is called directly from within the loop to get the following Fibonacci number.\n\nWhat You Should Know About Yield\n\nMost things we saw before are probably already in your muscle memory, or you intuitively get what it does. Regarding the yield keyword, it makes sense to develop a mental model despite its use not being as intuitive as the other presented solutions.\n\nis used either with or to implement so-called iterator methods.\n\nTo have a mental model of how it works when using . You may think of it as being just streaming.\n\nLet us have a look at all relevant interfaces:\n\nSo both interfaces depend on IEnumerator, It’s time to look at that interface as well!\n\nI removed some of the code and comments from the interfaces that do not help explain the case. If you want to see the complete code, just hit “Go to definition” from within Visual Studio or the IDE of your choice.\n\nThe key takeaways when looking at those interfaces are the following:\n• Everyone implementing an iterator method with the help of and, therefore also, must implement the method and, therefore, cannot be stateless but rather hold its internal state respectively position in this “streamed” list.\n• adds the syntactic sugar to hide that state machine from you, so to say, another abstraction to your code that makes it shorter and boils it down to something elegant.\n\nAlso, it is worth pointing out the close relationship between and .\n\nEssentially, both concepts hide some of the complexity that can be seen again when we know what the compiler does behind the scenes with your iterator method.\n\nIn terms of a loop: This is not exactly what the compiler does, but it’s instead an example of what the code might look like if it compiles:\n\nWhy should I care about it when it’s less intuitive and more complex to read than other techniques?\n\nThe answer probably doesn’t surprise you: It is another tool in your toolbox. The more tools you know, the better.\n\nA picture says more than thousands of words. So here is an illustration of how you can think of a traditional method of aggregating a list of payload items and returning it:\n\nAs you can see in the illustration. The whole list is generated during that single method call, and the items are added to a .\n\nHere, we see what it looks like when streaming the data with :\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no need for a . The method gets called every time the caller wants a new item. The data is streamed and not aggregated as a list.\n\nSolution 7: Trying Something Different – Yield (2)\n\nJust a change to the calling method of solution 6 to try to make the code faster:\n\nAn array list is an array that can hold any object as an item. You can also say it is not statically typed. Therefore, you must “unbox” the value to the correct data type.\n\nThe value in this example gets unboxed, which means it gets copied from a reference of the hap onto a value type of the stack. This is not beneficial to our performance, as we can see later in the results.\n\nPlease note that was introduced before there existed generic Lists. Generic lists are better because they do not involve boxing and unboxing, which adds overhead (e.g. ) when accessing an item on the list.\n\nThe array is the most straightforward solution I can think of. You define an array whose size is known during compile time ( is a variable that is defined as on the class level).\n\nis a way to address consecutive memory. For an in-depth overview of the keyword, I recommend an article on the ndepend blog: Improve C# code performance with Span<T>.\n\nThe following code eliminates the need for the helper variable:\n\nSuppose you want to know how to set up a solution with BenchmarkDotNet. In that case, I recommend you clone the repository (matthiasjost/FibonacciSequence) that belongs to this article.\n\nI will quickly summarize the key takeaways with the related code snippets here. This is not a step-by-step guide but an overview. I recommend reading A Step by Step Guide to Benchmarking in .NET by Philippe Vaillancourt to learn how to have it in your solution step by step.\n\nAlso, don’t forget to look at the official BenchmarkDotNet Homepage: benchmarkdotnet.org\n\nWhere Are The Relevant Source Code Parts To Execute And Configure BenchmarkDotNet\n\nA .NET Console application with a unique “startup” code is required to run your benchmarks:\n\nis the class that is instantiated to run the benchmark.\n\nEvery method that has the decorator will get executed during the benchmark.\n\nAlso, you can set the baseline:\n\nThe baseline defines which method will be defined with a ratio of 1.00 whereas other methods get their respective factor depending on their execution time.\n\nBenchmarkDotNet is going to show you a table in the console with these columns:\n• Mean: Arithmetic mean of all measurements\n\nBuild the Release version of the console project. An attached debugger might affect your results!\n\nThen, execute the executable from Windows Explorer or your Console.\n\nYou will notice a lot of output in the console window.\n\n\n\nFor every benchmark execution, a version of your benchmark gets built and automatically created in the folder of your benchmark project. See this example output:\n\nThe benchmark will start in a particular way: In its default configuration, your code will not run once but multiple times. You will also notice some output during this phase:\n\nBenchmarkDotNet executes the benchmark multiple times. What you will find interesting is what it takes to have a reliable benchmark; I am going to quote the GitHub Readme:\n\nSo, there is more to benchmarking than just starting a timer to summarize this.\n\nThis is the result table of the console application output:\n\nThe following table focuses on the ratio of the different solutions and highlights the differences between the solutions:\n\nYou can also go to Charts for BenchmarkDotNet (chartbenchmark.net) and paste the result table from your console there to get a visualisation of your results:\n\nAs you have noticed, we have been using in all the examples. We do this because a regular wouldn’t be large enough, and your additions would lead to an overflow. In most cases, you wouldn’t even notice when you only write unit tests against a few low numbers.\n\nYou can use the keyword to ensure an integer does not overflow, and if it does, an exception is thrown. See also the docs: checked and unchecked statements\n\nTo get a sense of how large the Fibonacci number is when the sequence length is 1000 (which we used for our benchmarks). Here it is (209 digits):\n\nPlease note you shouldn’t be using but int in most cases. BigIntegers can hold arbitrarily large numbers but will significantly negatively impact the performance.\n\nFeel free to lower the sequence length to speed up the total benchmark duration.\n\nWe saw different solutions for generating the Fibonacci number sequence in C#. Then we learned about the keyword and how to use it. Finally, we used the BenchmarkDotNet library to compare the solutions.\n\nDoes any of the results surprise you?\n\nHave you found a faster solution to this problem?\n\nLet me know!\n• GitHub repository with Visual Studio 2022 solution for this article: matthiasjost/FibonacciSequence\n• Philippe Vaillancourt‘s blog article about Benchmark.NET, including a YouTube video: A Step by Step Guide to Benchmarking in .NET\n• I was inspired to write this article comparing different solutions in C# and F#: Fibonacci Sequences with Kotlin, C#, and F# by Khalid Abuhakmeh.\n• Steven Giesel‘s illustrations inspired me for the ones in this article.

        "document": "You can store multiple variables of the same type in an array data structure. You declare an array by specifying the type of its elements. If you want the array to store elements of any type, you can specify as its type. In the unified type system of C#, all types, predefined and user-defined, reference types and value types, inherit directly or indirectly from Object.\n\nAn array is a reference type, so the array can be a nullable reference type. The element types might be reference types, so an array can be declared to hold nullable reference types. The following example declarations show the different syntax used to declare the nullability of the array or the elements:\n\nUninitialized elements in an array are set to the default value for that type:\n\nAn array has the following properties:\n• An array can be single-dimensional, multidimensional, or jagged.\n• The number of dimensions are set when an array variable is declared. The length of each dimension is established when the array instance is created. These values can't be changed during the lifetime of the instance.\n• A jagged array is an array of arrays, and each member array has the default value of .\n• Arrays are zero indexed: an array with elements is indexed from to .\n• Array elements can be of any type, including an array type.\n• Array types are reference types derived from the abstract base type Array. All arrays implement IList and IEnumerable. You can use the foreach statement to iterate through an array. Single-dimensional arrays also implement IList<T> and IEnumerable<T>.\n\nThe elements of an array can be initialized to known values when the array is created. Beginning with C# 12, all of the collection types can be initialized using a Collection expression. Elements that aren't initialized are set to the default value. The default value is the 0-bit pattern. All reference types (including non-nullable types), have the values . All value types have the 0-bit patterns. That means the Nullable<T>.HasValue property is and the Nullable<T>.Value property is undefined. In the .NET implementation, the property throws an exception.\n\nThe following example creates single-dimensional, multidimensional, and jagged arrays:\n\nA single-dimensional array is a sequence of like elements. You access an element via its index. The index is its ordinal position in the sequence. The first element in the array is at index . You create a single-dimensional array using the new operator specifying the array element type and the number of elements. The following example declares and initializes single-dimensional arrays:\n\nThe first declaration declares an uninitialized array of five integers, from to . The elements of the array are initialized to the default value of the element type, for integers. The second declaration declares an array of strings and initializes all seven values of that array. A series of statements prints all the elements of the array. For single-dimensional arrays, the statement processes elements in increasing index order, starting with index 0 and ending with index .\n\nYou can pass an initialized single-dimensional array to a method. In the following example, an array of strings is initialized and passed as an argument to a method for strings. The method displays the elements of the array. Next, the method reverses the array elements, and then the method modifies the first three elements of the array. After each method returns, the method shows that passing an array by value doesn't prevent changes to the array elements.\n\nArrays can have more than one dimension. For example, the following declarations create four arrays. Two arrays have have two dimensions. Two arrays have three dimensions. The first two declarations declare the length of each dimension, but don't initialize the values of the array. The second two declarations use an initializer to set the values of each element in the multidimensional array.\n\nFor multi-dimensional arrays, elements are traversed such that the indices of the rightmost dimension are incremented first, then the next left dimension, and so on, to the leftmost index. The following example enumerates both a 2D and a 3D array:\n\nIn a 2D array, you can think of the left index as the row and the right index as the column.\n\nHowever, with multidimensional arrays, using a nested for loop gives you more control over the order in which to process the array elements:\n\nYou pass an initialized multidimensional array to a method in the same way that you pass a one-dimensional array. The following code shows a partial declaration of a print method that accepts a two-dimensional array as its argument. You can initialize and pass a new array in one step, as is shown in the following example. In the following example, a two-dimensional array of integers is initialized and passed to the method. The method displays the elements of the array.\n\nA jagged array is an array whose elements are arrays, possibly of different sizes. A jagged array is sometimes called an \"array of arrays.\" Its elements are reference types and are initialized to . The following examples show how to declare, initialize, and access jagged arrays. The first example, , is declared in one statement. Each contained array is created in subsequent statements. The second example, is declared and initialized in one statement. It's possible to mix jagged and multidimensional arrays. The final example, , is a declaration and initialization of a single-dimensional jagged array that contains three two-dimensional array elements of different sizes.\n\nA jagged array's elements must be initialized before you can use them. Each of the elements is itself an array. It's also possible to use initializers to fill the array elements with values. When you use initializers, you don't need the array size.\n\nThis example builds an array whose elements are themselves arrays. Each one of the array elements has a different size.\n\nYou can create an implicitly typed array in which the type of the array instance is inferred from the elements specified in the array initializer. The rules for any implicitly typed variable also apply to implicitly typed arrays. For more information, see Implicitly Typed Local Variables.\n\nThe following examples show how to create an implicitly typed array:\n\nIn the previous example, notice that with implicitly typed arrays, no square brackets are used on the left side of the initialization statement. Also, jagged arrays are initialized by using just like single-dimensional arrays.\n\nWhen you create an anonymous type that contains an array, the array must be implicitly typed in the type's object initializer. In the following example, is an implicitly typed array of anonymous types, each of which contains an array named . The keyword isn't used inside the object initializers."

        "document": "An array is a data structure that contains a number of variables that are accessed through computed indices. The variables contained in an array, also called the elements of the array, are all of the same type, and this type is called the element type of the array.\n\nAn array has a rank that determines the number of indices associated with each array element. The rank of an array is also referred to as the dimensions of the array. An array with a rank of one is called a single-dimensional array. An array with a rank greater than one is called a multi-dimensional array. Specific sized multi-dimensional arrays are often referred to as two-dimensional arrays, three-dimensional arrays, and so on. Each dimension of an array has an associated length that is an integral number greater than or equal to zero. The dimension lengths are not part of the type of the array, but rather are established when an instance of the array type is created at run-time. The length of a dimension determines the valid range of indices for that dimension: For a dimension of length , indices can range from to inclusive. The total number of elements in an array is the product of the lengths of each dimension in the array. If one or more of the dimensions of an array have a length of zero, the array is said to be empty.\n\nThe element type of an array can itself be an array type (§17.2.1). Such arrays of arrays are distinct from multi-dimensional arrays and can be used to represent “jagged arrays”.\n\nEvery array type is a reference type (§8.2). The element type of an array can be any type, including value types and array types.\n\nThe grammar productions for array types are provided in §8.2.1.\n\nAn array type is written as a non_array_type followed by one or more rank_specifiers.\n\nA non_array_type is any type that is not itself an array_type.\n\nThe rank of an array type is given by the leftmost rank_specifier in the array_type: A rank_specifier indicates that the array is an array with a rank of one plus the number of “ ” tokens in the rank_specifier.\n\nThe element type of an array type is the type that results from deleting the leftmost rank_specifier:\n• An array type of the form is an array with rank and a non-array element type .\n• An array type of the form is an array with rank and an element type .\n\nIn effect, the rank_specifiers are read from left to right before the final non-array element type.\n\nAt run-time, a value of an array type can be or a reference to an instance of that array type.\n\nThe type is the abstract base type of all array types. An implicit reference conversion (§10.2.8) exists from any array type to and to any interface type implemented by . An explicit reference conversion (§10.3.5) exists from and any interface type implemented by to any array type. is not itself an array_type. Rather, it is a class_type from which all array_types are derived.\n\nAt run-time, a value of type can be or a reference to an instance of any array type.\n\nA single-dimensional array implements the interface ( for short) and its base interfaces. Accordingly, there is an implicit conversion from to and its base interfaces. In addition, if there is an implicit reference conversion from to then implements and there is an implicit reference conversion from to and its base interfaces (§10.2.8). If there is an explicit reference conversion from to then there is an explicit reference conversion from to and its base interfaces (§10.3.5).\n\nSimilarly, a single-dimensional array also implements the interface ( for short) and its base interfaces. Accordingly, there is an implicit conversion from to and its base interfaces. In addition, if there is an implicit reference conversion from to then implements and there is an implicit reference conversion from to and its base interfaces (§10.2.8). If there is an explicit reference conversion from to then there is an explicit reference conversion from to and its base interfaces (§10.3.5).\n\nWhenever there is an implicit or explicit reference conversion from to , there is also an explicit reference conversion from and its base interfaces to (§10.3.5).\n\nWhen an array type implements , some of the members of the implemented interface may throw exceptions. The precise behavior of the implementation of the interface is beyond the scope of this specification.\n\nArray instances are created by array_creation_expressions (§12.8.17.4) or by field or local variable declarations that include an array_initializer (§17.7). Array instances can also be created implicitly as part of evaluating an argument list involving a parameter array (§15.6.2.4).\n\nWhen an array instance is created, the rank and length of each dimension are established and then remain constant for the entire lifetime of the instance. In other words, it is not possible to change the rank of an existing array instance, nor is it possible to resize its dimensions.\n\nAn array instance is always of an array type. The type is an abstract type that cannot be instantiated.\n\nElements of arrays created by array_creation_expressions are always initialized to their default value (§9.3).\n\nArray elements are accessed using element_access expressions (§12.8.12.2) of the form , where is an expression of an array type and each is an expression of type , , , , or can be implicitly converted to one or more of these types. The result of an array element access is a variable, namely the array element selected by the indices.\n\nThe elements of an array can be enumerated using a statement (§13.9.5).\n\nEvery array type inherits the members declared by the type.\n\nFor any two reference_types and , if an implicit reference conversion (§10.2.8) or explicit reference conversion (§10.3.5) exists from to , then the same reference conversion also exists from the array type to the array type , where is any given rank_specifier (but the same for both array types). This relationship is known as array covariance. Array covariance, in particular, means that a value of an array type might actually be a reference to an instance of an array type , provided an implicit reference conversion exists from to .\n\nBecause of array covariance, assignments to elements of reference type arrays include a run-time check which ensures that the value being assigned to the array element is actually of a permitted type (§12.21.2).\n\nArray covariance specifically does not extend to arrays of value_types. For example, no conversion exists that permits an to be treated as an .\n\nArray initializers may be specified in field declarations (§15.5), local variable declarations (§13.6.2), and array creation expressions (§12.8.17.4):\n\nAn array initializer consists of a sequence of variable initializers, enclosed by “ ” and “ ” tokens and separated by “ ” tokens. Each variable initializer is an expression or, in the case of a multi-dimensional array, a nested array initializer.\n\nThe context in which an array initializer is used determines the type of the array being initialized. In an array creation expression, the array type immediately precedes the initializer, or is inferred from the expressions in the array initializer. In a field or variable declaration, the array type is the type of the field or variable being declared. When an array initializer is used in a field or variable declaration,\n\nit is simply shorthand for an equivalent array creation expression:\n\nFor a single-dimensional array, the array initializer shall consist of a sequence of expressions, each having an implicit conversion to the element type of the array (§10.2). The expressions initialize array elements in increasing order, starting with the element at index zero. The number of expressions in the array initializer determines the length of the array instance being created.\n\nFor a multi-dimensional array, the array initializer shall have as many levels of nesting as there are dimensions in the array. The outermost nesting level corresponds to the leftmost dimension and the innermost nesting level corresponds to the rightmost dimension. The length of each dimension of the array is determined by the number of elements at the corresponding nesting level in the array initializer. For each nested array initializer, the number of elements shall be the same as the other array initializers at the same level.\n\nIf a dimension other than the rightmost is given with length zero, the subsequent dimensions are assumed to also have length zero.\n\nWhen an array creation expression includes both explicit dimension lengths and an array initializer, the lengths shall be constant expressions and the number of elements at each nesting level shall match the corresponding dimension length."
