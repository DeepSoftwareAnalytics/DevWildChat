        "document": "It is common to represent binary data or numbers using the hexadecimal notation. Effectively, we use a base-16 representation where the first 10 digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and where the following digits are A, B, C, D, E, F, with the added complexity that we can use either lower or upper case (A or a).\n\nWe sometimes want to convert strings of hexadecimal characters into a numerical value. For simplicity, let us assume that we have sequences of four character. This is a common use case due to unicode escape sequences in C, JavaScript, C# and so forth.\n\nEach character is represented as a byte value using its corresponding ASCII code point. So ‘0’ becomes 48, ‘1’ is 49, ‘A’ is 65 and so forth.\n\nThe most efficient approach I have found is to simply rely on memoization. Build a 256-byte array where 48 (or ‘0’) is mapped to 0, 65 (or ‘A’) is mapped to 10 and so forth. As an extra feature, map all disallowed values to -1 so we can detect them. Then just lookup the four values and combine them.\n\nWhat else could you do?\n\nYou could replace the table lookup with a fancy mathematical function:\n\nHow do they compare? I implemented both of these and I find that the table lookup approach is more than twice as fast when the function is called frequently. I report the number of instructions and the number of cycles to parse 4-character sequences on a Skylake processor (code compiled with GNU GCC 8).\n\nI am still frustrated by the cost of this operation. Using 4 cycles to convert 4 characters to a number feels like too much of an expense.\n\nMy source code is available (run it under Linux).\n\nFurther reading: Fast hex number string to int by Johnny Lee; Using PEXT to convert from hexadecimal ASCII to number by Mula."

        "document": "Natural language processing (NLP) is now at the forefront of technological innovation. The world is getting wrapped up in GPTs, Bards, and Anthropics. These deep-learning transformers are incredibly powerful but are only a small subset of the entire NLP field, which has been going on for over six decades.\n\nWith NLP, you can translate languages, extract emotion and sentiment from large volumes of text, and even generate human-like responses for chatbots. NLP's versatility and adaptability make it a cornerstone in the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence.\n\nHere, we want to take you through a practical guide to implementing some NLP tasks like Sentiment Analysis, Emotion detection, and Question detection with the help of Python, Hex, and HuggingFace.\n\nLike any machine learning task, language data must go through a series of steps to achieve the desired state needed for the model building. This text preprocessing has several stages, with these as the most common:\n• None Tokenization: This involves breaking down text into smaller elements like words or characters, known as tokens, which are easier for deep learning models to process. While there are various methods and tools for tokenization, such as NLTK, SpaCy, BERT Tokenizer, SentencePiece, and Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), challenges can arise due to complexity, ambiguity, and special characters.\n• None Text Processing and Normalization: After tokenization, unnecessary elements like special characters, stop words, and punctuations are removed to clean the text. Additionally, converting all text to lowercase aids in readability. The cleaned text is then subjected to stemming and lemmatization to normalize it to its base or dictionary form. Finally, the text is converted into numerical vectors through vectorization using methods like Bag of Words, TfIDF, Word2Vec, and GloVe, making it understandable to machine learning and deep learning models.\n• None Part-of-speech tagging. Part of speech tagging is a necessary stage for different NLP-based models. POS tags different words in the text to different parts of speech, such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives. This way, it helps uncover the syntactical meaning of text.\n\nWhat can you do with NLP? Truthfully, a lot. New models and paradigms are being deployed every day. However, the core NLP tasks remain the same.\n\nSentiment analysis evaluates text, often product or service reviews, to categorize sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral. This process is vital for organizations, as it helps gauge customer satisfaction with their offerings. Companies across various sectors, including sales, finance, and healthcare, can understand and improve user experiences by analyzing large volumes of customer feedback.\n\nIn recent years, question-answering systems have become increasingly popular in AI development. Instead of browsing the internet and sifting through numerous links for information, these systems provide direct answers to queries. Advanced models like ChatGPT and Bard exemplify this technology. Trained on extensive text data, they can respond to questions with accuracy and relevance that sometimes surpasses human capabilities.\n\nMachine translation is the automated process of translating text from one language to another. With the vast number of languages worldwide, overcoming language barriers is challenging. AI-driven machine translation, using statistical, rule-based, hybrid, and neural machine translation techniques, is revolutionizing this field. The advent of large language models marks a significant advancement in efficient and accurate machine translation.\n\nWith businesses often dealing with vast amounts of unstructured text data, extracting meaningful insights can be daunting for human analysts. Text summarization addresses this challenge by condensing large text volumes into concise, relevant summaries. This technology enables a quick and efficient understanding of data, assisting businesses in determining its utility and relevance.\n\nThese use cases are just the tip of the iceberg; plenty of other NLP use cases are being applied daily across multiple businesses.\n\nMost NLP algorithms rely on rule-based systems, where, at some point, a human has to define different rules about language for the algorithm to use.\n\nThese can work well for simple examples, but language is rarely straightforward. For example, “Great, I am late again for the class” initially has a negative sentiment, but looking at the word great there is a high chance that rule-based models will classify it as positive.\n\nThe big breakthrough for NLP has been the rise of deep-learning models. Developers have deployed CNN, RNN, and its variants (LSTM and GRU) that perform well on complex tasks like text classification, generation, and sentiment analysis.\n\nThere are a couple of issues with these models, though:\n• None They fail to capture the long-term dependencies in text.\n• None They struggle to identify the context of words in a long sentence chain.\n\nIn the past few years, the attention mechanism has been the core insight into mitigating these problems due to its ability to capture long-term dependencies and the context of words in the sentence. Combining multiple components like encoder, decoder, self-attention, and positional encoding helps it achieve better results on NLP tasks. Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Bard, and Grok work on this concept.\n\nIt is resource-heavy to train the LLMs as you need vast amounts of data. A simple model with 1 Billion parameters takes around 80 GB of memory (with 32-bit full precision) for parameters, optimizers, gradients, activations, and temp memory. Usually, you use the existing pre-trained model directly on your data (works for most cases) or try to fine-tune them on your specific data using PEFT, but this also requires good computational infrastructure.\n\nIn this article, you will see how to utilize the existing models to test them on your custom dataset. We will use a platform called HuggingFace that contains many model architectures for NLP, computer vision, and other machine-learning tasks. This platform allows users to build, train, and deploy ML models with the help of existing open-source models. You can check a list of pre-train NLP models from HuggingFace here.\n\nLet’s implement Sentiment Analysis, Emotion Detection, and Question Detection with the help of Python, Hex, and HuggingFace. This section will use the Python 3.11 language, Hex as a development environment, and HuggingFace to use different trained models.\n\nLet’s start with installing the necessary dependencies with PIP as follows:\n\nOnce the dependencies are installed, you can import them to the Hex environment as follows:\n\nFor this article, we will use the Amazon reviews dataset that is stored in the Snowflake warehouse. Hex provides connectors for different cold storage, databases, and warehouses to load and store the data. You can also upload the file-based dataset to Hex workspace. You can use the simple SQL statement to fetch the data from the warehouse and the result will be the loaded dataset in the DataFrame.\n\nAs you can see the dataset contains different columns for , , and .\n\nHere are the models we are going to use:\n• None We are going to use is a sentiment analysis model that classifies the user reviews into negative, positive, and neutral classes.\n• None An emotion detection model that predicts the emotions wrapped in a text.\n• None Finally, we will use a question detection system that will help us identify if the given text is a statement or a question posted by the user.\n\nWe will create a list of three models (from HuggingFace) so that we can run them together on the text data.\n\nNext, we will iterate over each model name and load the model using the package.\n\nNext, we will create a single function that will accept the text string and will apply all the models to make predictions.\n\nIn the above function, we are making predictions with the help of three different models and mapping the results based on the models. Finally, we are returning a list that comprises three different predictions corresponding to three different models.\n\nFor HuggingFace models, you just need to pass the raw text to the models and they will apply all the preprocessing steps to convert data into the necessary format for making predictions.\n\nHex provides an interactive environment where you can provide the variable values. Reading the value of the variable will look something like this:\n\nLet’s use the above function to make predictions on the text data.\n\nYou can use the beauty of Hex to present the results in appealing visuals as follows:\n\nNow let’s make predictions over the entire dataset and store the results back to the original dataframe for further exploration.\n\nRunning this code chunk will take a lot of time to complete as there are multiple rows of data. Once done the dataset will look like this:\n\nWe will drop the duplicate data from this to remove the data redundancy.\n\nNow, let’s check the aggregate results of these predicted columns with the help of a simple SQL command:\n\nAs you can see in the above image, the results make perfect sense.\n\nNow let’s explore the individual products in the dataset. Since the product name is not given, we have no idea what each product is. To fix this, we will use a method called Term-frequency Inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) to extract possible topics, or themes from our reviews.\n\nLet’s first select the top 200 products from the dataset using the following SQL statement.\n\nThen using Hex, you can select the product ID and then filter out the data for that product.\n\nFor the selected product, you can check the ratio of negative and positive sentiments and emotions associated with the product.\n\nTo identify the name of the product from the existing reviews, you use the TF-IDF. This method gives the count of each term in the document and conveys its importance. Generally, in a clean text, a high occurrence of words represents high importance. These words in a corpus (collection of documents) are referred to as a gram. The collection of two words is a bi-gram, a combination of 4 words is a quad-gram, and similarly, the collection of N words is an N-gram. We may extract information about the potential product from the reviews by applying TF-IDF across all of them.\n\nSince we are not using any HuggingFace model for this, you need to write the code to clean the text. General cleaning steps are:\n• None Removing the emojis from the text.\n• None Removing unwanted information such as stopwords, special characters, user mentions, hashtags, and punctuation as they can increase the complexity of the analysis.\n• None Removing the words that are in other languages. Focusing on one language will give us the exact information that we want as the other language words will have almost negligible occurrence.\n• None Apply lemmatization and stemming to bring the words to their original form in the corpus.\n\nThe code for all these methods looks like this:\n\nNow, you can apply this pipeline to the product DataFrame that we have filtered above for specific product IDs.\n\nNow it’s time to create a method to perform the TF-IDF on the cleaned dataset.\n\nThe defines the gram count that you can define as per your document (1, 2, 3, …..). Let’s apply this method to the text to get the frequency count of N-grams in the dataset.\n\nThis is it, you can now get the most valuable text (combination) for a product which can be used to identify the product.\n\nYou have seen the basics of NLP and some of the most popular use cases in NLP. You have also seen the evolution of models used for the same. Now it is time for you to train, model, and deploy your own AI-super agent to take over the world."

A main property of proper encryption is that there is no statistically significant relation between original content and encrypted content. The statistic properties of encrypted content are similar to random data instead and thus provide absolutely no value as a feature in machine learning.\n\nThere are a few information which can be used though, like\n• size of encrypted payload which is similar to the size of original payload but not not exactly the same\n• timing and direction of data, which also reflect the timing and direction of the original data\n• some meta information from the TLS handshake, like server name (SNI), certificate information (up to TLS 1.2), TLS client fingerprint (JA3), chosen cipher ...\n\nThere are actually lots of publications about this topic."

        "document": "For humans, pattern recognition is a cognitive process in the brain. We can effortlessly match the information we see with the data stored in our memories. We can instantly differentiate between an image of a flower and an animal or identify a familiar face while scrolling Instagram. But have you ever wondered how new technologies like Alexa or Google Image Search work? Isn’t it intriguing and exciting to see Alexa acknowledge you by name when you say Techniques for finding patterns in different forms of data have undergone substantial development over the past decades.\n\nNow let’s have a quick look at the pros and cons of the pattern recognition technique. ✅ Pattern recognition helps to solve classification scenarios like biometric detection problems, and classification of nodules into tumourous/non-tumourous cells in medical imaging. ✅ Pattern recognition is useful for object detection, especially for identifying distant and hidden objects, or ones visible at different angles than in the input data. AI models can make nuanced observations and correlate multiple patterns across vast amounts of data, which is one of the most valuable applications of pattern recognition. ✅ Pattern recognition is adept at summarizing all feature vectors and data patterns, which enables it to forecast stock prices and make accurate extrapolated predictions in general. ❌ Pattern recognition tends to be data-hungry. In other words, much training data is required to train neural networks for pattern analysis. Storing such huge amounts of data may further limit pattern recognition applications. ❌ Issues with data quality. Training data for machine learning algorithms should come from reliable sources. It should be free from bias and noise that hamper inherent pattern identification and decision-making capabilities of the neural network. ❌ Long training time. Identified patterns are not only hard to analyze but also take a lot of time to gather data, preprocess it, and train the model. Pattern recognition has a number of more and less known applications across various industries. Predicting future stock values is one of the most challenging tasks. Initially, linear and decision machine learning models were used, but now deep learning models are used as well. Many traders use chart patterns, combined with other pattern recognition algorithms involving deep learning and LSTM, to make their trading decisions and do stock market forecasting. Pro Tip: check out AI for Financial Statements to learn more about recent applications of this technology. Pattern recognition serves as a way of describing data by highlighting its distinct features, which are themselves patterns. It's used to analyze available user data and segment it by selected features. Google Analytics is one prominent source of such features. Data collected by Google Analytics can be related to what a customer intends to buy when they visit a particular website, the number of people who viewed a post, and whether they had any interaction with the content, such as clicks. Reviewing transaction data could help in the identification of behavioral segmentation patterns within website visits and e-commerce transactions. Many OTT platforms and e-commerce companies rely on complex AI engines that analyze patterns of user behaviors to personalize their offerings. Netflix's \"You might also like\" and Amazon's \"People also buy\" are examples of this. Pattern recognition is a way of identifying the building blocks in text, like words, grammar, and the pattern it follows. This is used in grammar checkers, machine translations, content categorization, and more. In the business world, text processing is used a lot to improve customer service. Pattern recognition systems look for helpful information in customer feedback and product reviews. This includes things like the keywords used, how the customer feels, and what they want. This is important for things like competitor and market analysis. We can learn about what people think of a company, where they are located, and more. Example of scanned and annotated text Optical character recognition , or OCR, is a technology that allows you to convert scanned documents, screenshots, and other digital images into editable and searchable electronic files. OCR saves time and increases efficiency by eliminating the need for manual data entry. To perform OCR, digital images are first segmented and processed to detect optical patterns. These patterns are then classified as letters, numbers, symbols, etc. In the banking sector, OCR is also used in signature verification. Every chatbot works by using a machine learning algorithm to classify the text based on the inherent pattern of the sentence and produce a suitable response. The curator of the system is responsible for mapping all possible patterns to the set of possible responses. This brute force technique using natural language processing as the core is another excellent example of pattern recognition applications. In images, pattern recognition can be used to find edges, lines, and shapes. This is used in image processing, computer vision, and more. One of the most common issues in medical imaging concerns poor quality, which makes it hard for radiologists to interpret the images. To overcome this, computer vision techniques are used in biomedical imaging to detect the presence of tumors or identify the onset of diseases. This computer-aided diagnosis is done by observing meaningful features and abnormalities in the patterns that may be hidden from humans. These pattern recognition techniques, coupled with image processing , are also used in drug development. For example, DNA sequencing played a major role in the development of the Covid vaccine. Pro Tip: Check out this ultimate guide to medical imaging annotation . Image processing and computer vision used by search engines and e-commerce marketplaces rely on pattern recognition techniques to support image search. This works in the same way as an alphanumeric search query, but with images instead. Image metadata and additional textual hints increase the efficiency of the results and help to better filter the options based on the context. For example, such technologies are widely applied by Google and Amazon. Pro Tip: To learn more about ways to enhance the learning of computer vision tasks, have a look at this introductory guide to contrastive learning . Pattern recognition is used in voice-activated devices to identify patterns in speech. This allows devices like car navigation systems, Alexa, and voice search engines to understand and respond to commands. Speech recognition techniques are also used in text-to-voice and voice-to-text apps like Google Assistant. This allows people with visual impairments to hear and send back the text. Voice assistants for businesses (like e-ecommerce) also use these techniques to provide around-the-clock support to millions of website and mobile app users. Automatic speech recognition is a technology that can listen and respond to commands, saving people from having to type long commands. Automatic captioning is another technology that converts speech to text and then displays the text on a screen. This can be seen on YouTube or Facebook when subtitles are automatically generated for videos. Additionally, pattern recognition helps identify music that has been copied from another artist. By looking at the waveforms and amplitudes of the sound, experts can see if one piece of music is similar to another. This can help solve copyright issues for musicians. Pattern recognition can be used to solve security concerns, for example by detecting civil unrest via social media. A lot of data is generated on social networks every minute, and AI can help turn this data into useful information by detecting patterns. For example, Facebook uses pattern recognition to detect fake profiles created using other people’s profile photos. Computer networks have intrusion detection systems that analyze the pattern of data and incoming traffic. Depending on the pattern of the data, it can judge any abnormalities or intrusion in the system and help prevent attacks on secure networks. Pattern recognition technology is used in big data analysis to find combinations of inherent patterns that occur together frequently or rarely. This information forms the feature set for the data and helps in the prediction of unseen data. There is an endless number of possibilities as pattern recognition is getting more futuristic and intelligent with a great impact on human life. The future of pattern recognition applications lies in the domain of image processing, like medical diagnosis, object detection, computer vision, natural language processing, like handwriting recognition , and many more."

        "document": "Pattern is everything around in this digital world. A pattern can either be seen physically or it can be observed mathematically by applying algorithms.\n\nExample: The colors on the clothes, speech pattern, etc. In computer science, a pattern is represented using vector feature values. \n\nWhat is Pattern Recognition? \n\nPattern recognition is the process of recognizing patterns by using a machine learning algorithm. Pattern recognition can be defined as the classification of data based on knowledge already gained or on statistical information extracted from patterns and/or their representation. One of the important aspects of pattern recognition is its application potential.\n\nExamples: Speech recognition, speaker identification, multimedia document recognition (MDR), automatic medical diagnosis. \n\nIn a typical pattern recognition application, the raw data is processed and converted into a form that is amenable for a machine to use. Pattern recognition involves the classification and cluster of patterns.\n• In classification, an appropriate class label is assigned to a pattern based on an abstraction that is generated using a set of training patterns or domain knowledge. Classification is used in supervised learning.\n• Clustering generated a partition of the data which helps decision making, the specific decision-making activity of interest to us. Clustering is used in unsupervised learning.\n\nFeatures may be represented as continuous, discrete, or discrete binary variables. A feature is a function of one or more measurements, computed so that it quantifies some significant characteristics of the object.\n\nExample: consider our face then eyes, ears, nose, etc are features of the face. \n\nA set of features that are taken together, forms the features vector.\n\nExample: In the above example of a face, if all the features (eyes, ears, nose, etc) are taken together then the sequence is a feature vector([eyes, ears, nose]). The feature vector is the sequence of a feature represented as a d-dimensional column vector. In the case of speech, MFCC (Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficient) is the spectral feature of the speech. The sequence of the first 13 features forms a feature vector. \n\nPattern recognition possesses the following features:\n• Accurately recognize shapes and objects from different angles\n• Identify patterns and objects even when partly hidden\n• Recognize patterns quickly with ease, and with automaticity.\n\nTraining and Learning in Pattern Recognition \n\nLearning is a phenomenon through which a system gets trained and becomes adaptable to give results in an accurate manner. Learning is the most important phase as to how well the system performs on the data provided to the system depends on which algorithms are used on the data. The entire dataset is divided into two categories, one which is used in training the model i.e. Training set, and the other that is used in testing the model after training, i.e. Testing set.\n• Training set: \n\nThe training set is used to build a model. It consists of the set of images that are used to train the system. Training rules and algorithms are used to give relevant information on how to associate input data with output decisions. The system is trained by applying these algorithms to the dataset, all the relevant information is extracted from the data, and results are obtained. Generally, 80% of the data of the dataset is taken for training data.\n• Testing set: \n\nTesting data is used to test the system. It is the set of data that is used to verify whether the system is producing the correct output after being trained or not. Generally, 20% of the data of the dataset is used for testing. Testing data is used to measure the accuracy of the system. For example, a system that identifies which category a particular flower belongs to is able to identify seven categories of flowers correctly out of ten and the rest of others wrong, then the accuracy is 70 %\n\n\n\nReal-time Examples and Explanations: \n\nA pattern is a physical object or an abstract notion. While talking about the classes of animals, a description of an animal would be a pattern. While talking about various types of balls, then a description of a ball is a pattern. In the case balls considered as pattern, the classes could be football, cricket ball, table tennis ball, etc. Given a new pattern, the class of the pattern is to be determined. The choice of attributes and representation of patterns is a very important step in pattern classification. A good representation is one that makes use of discriminating attributes and also reduces the computational burden in pattern classification.\n\nAn obvious representation of a pattern will be a vector. Each element of the vector can represent one attribute of the pattern. The first element of the vector will contain the value of the first attribute for the pattern being considered.\n\nExample: While representing spherical objects, (25, 1) may be represented as a spherical object with 25 units of weight and 1 unit diameter. The class label can form a part of the vector. If spherical objects belong to class 1, the vector would be (25, 1, 1), where the first element represents the weight of the object, the second element, the diameter of the object and the third element represents the class of the object. \n\nAdvantages:\n• It is useful for cloth pattern recognition for visually impaired blind people.\n• We can recognize particular objects from different angles.\n• The syntactic pattern recognition approach is complex to implement and it is a very slow process.\n• Sometimes to get better accuracy, a larger dataset is required.\n• It cannot explain why a particular object is recognized. \n\nExample: my face vs my friend’s face.\n• Image processing, segmentation, and analysis \n\nPattern recognition is used to give human recognition intelligence to machines that are required in image processing.\n• Computer vision \n\nPattern recognition is used to extract meaningful features from given image/video samples and is used in computer vision for various applications like biological and biomedical imaging.\n• Seismic analysis \n\nThe pattern recognition approach is used for the discovery, imaging, and interpretation of temporal patterns in seismic array recordings. Statistical pattern recognition is implemented and used in different types of seismic analysis models.\n• Radar signal classification/analysis \n\nPattern recognition and signal processing methods are used in various applications of radar signal classifications like AP mine detection and identification.\n• Speech recognition \n\nThe greatest success in speech recognition has been obtained using pattern recognition paradigms. It is used in various algorithms of speech recognition which tries to avoid the problems of using a phoneme level of description and treats larger units such as words as pattern\n• Fingerprint identification \n\nFingerprint recognition technology is a dominant technology in the biometric market. A number of recognition methods have been used to perform fingerprint matching out of which pattern recognition approaches are widely used.\n\nImagine we have a dataset containing information about apples and oranges. The features of each fruit are its color (red or yellow) and its shape (round or oval). We can represent each fruit using a list of strings, e.g. [‘red’, ’round’] for a red, round fruit.\n\nOur goal is to write a function that can predict whether a given fruit is an apple or an orange. To do this, we will use a simple pattern recognition algorithm called k-nearest neighbors (k-NN).\n\nHere is the function in Python:"
