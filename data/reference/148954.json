It maintains the document's appearance across different platforms and devices.\n\nWhile PDF remains more widespread, OFD has gained traction in specific sectors, such as government offices. It is because of its strong security features and commitment to strict standards.

        "document": "I don't have macOS Catalina to confirm, but I believe the first occurrence of this Preview PDF/A feature arrived in macOS Big Sur.\n\nYou can open a PDF in Preview, and then from the File menu, select Export… On that new panel, you set Format to PDF and then select the now present Create PDF/A. I strongly suggest appending the filename with _pdfa.pdf (so it is obvious in the Finder), and then saving it. Optionally, you can also select Create Linearized PDF which is another name for Fast Web View. This is the only place in Preview where you have this capability.\n\nThe PDF/A standard does not allow images or artwork in the PDF. Preview presently only saves this as a PDF/A-2b, and Preview has no means to inform you that it is a PDF/A-2b document when reopened in that application. When opened in the current Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, a blue banner appears across the top of the PDF, and the Adobe application will provide this information:\n\nThe key takeaway here is . That means that the PDF must be verified by a third-party conformance tool such as Adobe Acrobat Pro DC, or veraPDF. There are several other online sites that claim to do this, but you need to upload the PDF and that is not a good idea if it contains corporate sensitive or personal information.\n\nWhat I have described is the only means to create an unverified PDF/A document using Apple products. I don't recommend it as it is forward fragile with future operating system updates, but in June 2021, I wrote a GUI AppleScript to do the above export to PDF/A in Preview. It worked reliably then and took a long time to debug. I just ran it on macOS 11.6.3 with a single-page text-based PDF and it broke. Apple has changed something in the layout of Preview's internal structure since last June. This is the false promise of doing GUI scripting as it will eventually break.\n\nWhatever Apple is doing in Preview to export to PDF/A does not appear to be present in the public developer frameworks, or I cannot find it.\n\nThe free LibreOffice Writer (currently 7.3) allows one on its Export to PDF panel to select PDF/A-1b, 2b, 3b, and PDF/UA-1 export standards. Once you select something there, it remains selected, and using the LibreOffice command-line tool to export to PDF remembers that panel's last settings.\n\nHowever, opening a PDF in LibreOffice Draw does not grant you access to this panel, so you cannot transform an existing PDF into one of the PDF/A formats. One can open a PDF in Affinity Designer and then export it to (unverified) PDF/A, and PDF/X formats. The following syntax will transform other types of documents to a PDF/A-3b and PDF/UA-1 based on the following command line, and write (in this case), foo.pdf in the same filesystem location:\n\nYou would again, still need to open this in Adobe Acrobat Reader DC to confirm it has these standards hints awaiting actual PDF/A, and PDF/UA verification.﻿\n\nAnd finally, if one has the optional Ghostscript installed via a package manager, one can transform existing PDF documents (again without artwork or images) into PDF/A-1, and PDF/A-2 documents. Stackoverflow has examples of this approach."

        "document": "The shift towards digital documentation is evident, with 80% of academic journals now available in e-format and 72% of organizations embracing paperless strategies. This trend has led to a significant increase in PDF conversions, making it the preferred format for distributing unmodifiable files.\n\nHowever, the transition to digital documentation, while convenient, is not without its challenges. Issues such as formatting loss, inaccuracies in optical character recognition (OCR), and compatibility problems can arise.\n\nIn this article, we will address these common challenges head-on, presenting detailed solutions and guiding you through the selection of the right conversion tools to overcome these obstacles. Let's dive in.\n\nHere are some of the most prevalent issues:\n\n1. Loss of formatting and layout integrity: Maintaining the original formatting and layout of a document during conversion can be tricky. Elements such as fonts, spacing, and images may not translate accurately, leading to a distorted final output. This can be particularly problematic for documents with intricate designs or specialized formatting requirements. \n\n\n\n2. Issues with character recognition (OCR) accuracy: OCR technology is essential for converting scanned docs or images into editable text. Yet, accuracy may suffer due to factors like poor image quality, non-standard fonts, or skewed text. This leads to errors or misinterpretations in the converted text, impacting the document's quality and usability.\n\n3. Compatibility issues with different file formats: Some file conversion tools struggle with handling various file types, leading to compatibility issues when converting PDFs to editable file types like Word or Excel. This can result in formatting problems, data loss, or file damage. Choose conversion tools that support multiple formats to prevent these issues.\n\n4. Handling complex or encrypted PDFs: Complex PDFs, such as those containing interactive elements, multimedia content, or advanced formatting, pose unique challenges during conversion. Similarly, encrypted PDFs, which are protected with passwords or encryption algorithms, may require specialized tools or permissions to convert successfully. Failure to handle these complexities properly can result in data loss or compromised document integrity.\n\nWhen it comes to selecting the right conversion tools, several options are available, each with its own set of features and capabilities. Let's do a quick PDF software comparison and look closely at some of the most popular choices:\n• None Adobe Acrobat: Adobe Acrobat is one of the most widely used PDF tools, offering comprehensive features for creating, editing, and converting files. It provides robust conversion capabilities with options to preserve formatting and layout integrity. However, it's pricey, especially for occasional users, and some find its advanced features hard to grasp.\n• None Smallpdf: Smallpdf is a user-friendly digital platform with various PDF features like conversion, compression, and editing. It has a simple interface and supports many file formats. It's great for individuals or small businesses looking for an easy and affordable tool. Keep in mind, though, that the free version has limits on file size and quantity.\n• None PDFelement: This is another popular PDF software that offers advanced features for editing, conversion, and collaboration. It provides accurate OCR technology for converting scanned documents and supports batch conversion for efficient processing. Though it has drawbacks, like struggles with large files and a free version that's somewhat limited, its benefits still make it a good choice for a PDF reader.\n• None Lumin: Lumin is a cloud-based editor and converter known for its intuitive interface and seamless conversion process. It offers features to edit, annotate, share, and PDF files. Users can equally create fillable forms, add e-signatures, collaborate, split, and safely with Lumin. Lumin is a cloud-based editor and converter known for its intuitive interface and seamless conversion process. It offers features to edit, annotate, share, and PDF files. Users can equally create fillable forms, add e-signatures, collaborate, split, andsafely with Lumin.\n\nIts user-friendly interface makes it accessible to a wide audience. It supports various file formats and is particularly adept at handling complex PDFs. Lumin is an excellent choice for users seeking a straightforward and accessible solution for PDF conversion.\n• None Nitro Pro: Nitro is loved for its simplicity, perfect for PDF conversions and edits, making work smoother. It's affordable and dependable, like Adobe, but cheaper. However, some users report problems converting PDFs to Word, like table formatting issues. Slow conversion times are also reported, causing workflow disruptions. Plus, initially, the interface was challenging, requiring time to learn and navigate effectively.\n• None Google PDF Converter: Easily accessible to anyone with an internet connection, Google PDF Converter is a free online tool. It offers basic conversion features, enabling users to convert PDFs to Word or JPEG formats. However, it may have limitations compared to advanced software, and it might face challenges with complex files or maintaining formatting integrity. Nonetheless, it's a handy option to protect PDF files.\n• None iLovePDF: iLovePDF is an online platform dedicated to helping you manage PDF files and offering a range of tools for editing, merging, and converting documents. Its easy interface and fast speed make it great for quick conversions. Plus, it has mobile apps for easy access anywhere. However, you can't convert multiple docs simultaneously; you must do it one by one. Also, it might not convert image-heavy PDFs as expected sometimes.\n\nAs you explore these options, consider factors such as your specific conversion needs, ease of use, compatibility with different file formats, budget constraints, and user preferences. Finding the one that aligns with your needs will contribute to smoother and more accurate conversions for all your PDF files.\n\nConverting PDFs efficiently requires a systematic approach. Follow these steps to navigate through the process smoothly:\n\nStep 1: Installing and setting up the conversion tool: Before you begin, ensure that you have the necessary software installed on your device. If you're using an online tool like Lumin, simply navigate to the website and create an account if needed. For desktop applications, follow the installation instructions provided by the software provider.\n\nStep 2: Selecting PDF files for conversion: With the tool open, navigate to the 'File' or 'Add Files' option. Choose the PDF files you wish to convert by browsing through your device's directories. Lumin allows you to select multiple files simultaneously for batch processing, saving you time and effort.\n\nStep 3: Configuring conversion options (e.g., output format, resolution, OCR settings): Before initiating the conversion, customize the settings according to your requirements. Specify the output format desired, such as Word, Excel, or HTML. Remember to adjust settings like resolution, compression level, and OCR when needed. For example, turning on OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is important for converting scanned docs into editable text.\n\nStep 4: Executing the conversion process: Once you've configured everything, start the conversion process. Just click 'Convert' or 'Start' in the app. Depending on the PDF size and complexity, it might take a while. Be patient and let the tool finish smoothly. Monitor the progress to ensure everything is proceeding smoothly.\n\nStep 5: Reviewing the converted files for accuracy and making adjustments if necessary: Once the conversion is completed, review the converted files to ensure accuracy and quality. Check for any formatting discrepancies, text errors, or missing elements. Compare the converted document with the original PDF to identify any discrepancies. If necessary, make adjustments using the editing tools provided by the conversion software.\n\nNavigating PDF conversion challenges demands the right tools and a systematic approach. Understanding common issues like formatting loss and OCR inaccuracies is key. By choosing suitable conversion software and following step-by-step procedures, users can ensure smooth and accurate transformations.\n\nWith the right approach, converting PDFs becomes a streamlined process, enabling efficient, error-free sharing and editing across various platforms and formats.

        "document": "The versatility and convenience of a web-based PDF format converter certainly cannot be disputed. According to Research and Markets, the projected valuation of the worldwide PDF editor market stands at $2.44 billion in 2023, with growth anticipated to reach $3.6 billion by 2028. \n\nAn online PDF converter offers many advantages, simplifying the process of transforming PDF documents into various formats, especially if they’re offered as a single comprehensive suite, like MobiPDF. With MobiPDF, you can edit, convert, organize, protect, and fill out PDF documents all in one place with great speed and efficiency thanks to the streamlined and Office-like user interface.\n\nOkay, so what is the good and ugly side of using a free PDF converter online? Let’s investigate!\n\n Based on the CommonCrawl database, the MIME type detection reveals that PDF is the second most prevalent file format on the web, surpassing the popularity of JPEG, PNG, or GIF files and trailing only behind HTML and XHTML.\n\n This is great news for every online PDF converter which is hard to beat when it comes to availability. Accessible at all hours, these digital tools allow you to transform to PDF any file at any time and place and generally feature simplified controls. This round-the-clock availability is especially beneficial for people working across different time zones or facing tight deadlines (we’ve all filled those shoes before, haven’t we?).\n\n Another clear benefit of online PDF converters is that they eliminate the hassle of software installations and purchases. Today, anyone with a working internet connection, regardless of their technical proficiency or financial means, can harness the power of online conversion, allowing you, me, and the neighbors upstairs to efficiently manage and organize PDFs.\n\nWith an online converter, you can seamlessly transform PDFs into diverse file types, including Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, and image files such as JPEG or PNG. You can also go the other way around, for instance convert image file to PDF. This will help you avoid any annoying compatibility roadblocks that could otherwise crop up during a cross-platform collaboration – for example when you want to share your work with a friend or colleague, but they don’t have that particular software installed or you want to use Excel formulas but can’t because your data is encoded in a PDF file format.\n\n Most online PDF conversion services are free to use while offering all the fundamental features that you can expect. This cost-effectiveness is especially welcome for all the frugal students out there embarking on human services degrees, small enterprises with budget constraints, or individuals carefully managing their finances. Even premium PDF format converter alternatives offering more advanced functionalities tend to be pretty easygoing on the wallet. This way, you could tailor your conversion experience to your specific requirements and budget constraints, which is always a plus on our list.\n\n Want to do more than just convert PDF to Word? Check out our pricing plans for MobiPDF and supercharge your workflow with a professional editor at your side.\n\nWhether you are converting PDF to image or to Excel, such tools allow you to transform individual files at neck-breaking speeds or even capitalize on the power of batch processing, or in other words – to convert multiple documents simultaneously – therefore saving you precious time and boosting your efficiency to sky-high levels.\n\n Most image to PDF converter tools and other similar options also incorporate valuable cloud-based storage solutions into their offerings (like MobiPDF does with its proprietary MobiDrive). This innovation allows you to securely preserve your converted files in the digital cloud, therefore saving precious storage space on your machine.\n\n Beyond the mere storage benefits, this approach guarantees ubiquitous access to your documents, irrespective of your physical location or device, and also provides better data security and disaster recovery capabilities. For instance, you could safeguard your files against local hardware failures, since everything will be backed into the cloud, allowing you to make an epic comeback even in the worst-case scenario.\n\n\n\nWhile online PDF conversion services offer remarkable convenience and flexibility, their downsides, ranging from potential privacy concerns to formatting issues, should definitely not be ignored. Here’s the full list of things to keep in mind as you browse the web for PDF tools.\n\n Privacy and security are primary concerns when using online PDF conversion services. According to IT Governance research, there were 73 publicly disclosed security incidents, resulting in the compromise of a total of 79,729,271 records.\n\n So, is it safe to convert PDF files online? It really comes down to avoiding providers who are known for not prioritizing user protection, opting to sell your data instead. Therefore, reviewing the service's privacy policy and data usage should be your jerk-knee reaction. Some platforms may collect user data for advertising or other purposes, so be aware of how your information is handled and do your research thoroughly. Ideally, you should land on a trustworthy service that can also password-protect a PDF file.\n\n Don’t get cyberbullied. Keep your PDF files safe around the clock with passwords, encryption, and digital signatures.\n\nWhile online converters are convenient, they may lack advanced features that are often included in dedicated on-premise software, such as an unlimited number of conversions or OCR support. You might also experience formatting issues or limitations in editing capabilities for complex documents. Taking this into account, it’s always a good idea to check your documents for any traces of complex formatting before using a web-based PDF to Word converter or a similar service.\n\n With online converters, everything works great until it doesn’t. If you're in an area with poor connectivity or facing server downtime on the service provider's end, it could disrupt your workflow. Most dedicated PDF tools, MobiPDF included, offer you an offline mode, taking your internet provider out of the equation and ensuring an uninterrupted workflow.\n\n Sometimes, online converters could stop working before they’ve even started due to built-in restrictions. So, why does PDF conversion fail when we need it most? Well, online converters often come with limitations on file size (typically 10MB), especially for free users. They also typically won’t be able to handle HTML or image files which often feature quite a few graphical elements and fonts.\n\n Additionally, the conversion process can sometimes lead to quality loss or compression of images and graphics since it’s either been intentionally downgraded to make you pay for better options or is simply badly coded to begin with.\n\nWhen choosing online PDF conversion services, it's important to think carefully about what you really need. While these tools make it infinitely easier to do things like turn a simple PDF into Word documents, you should be careful with files featuring complex formatting or sensitive information. In those cases, it's better to use dedicated software like MobiPDF which has strong security features and also doesn’t degrade the formatting or quality of the output file.\n\n\n\nAnother good rule of thumb is to choose tool makers who have a good history of keeping users’ information private and secure. Look at what other people have said about them, and check their policies to be sure they will protect your private information while performing the service.\n\n Online PDF conversion services offer a range of benefits, including convenience, format compatibility, and cost-effectiveness. However, it's crucial to be aware of their limitations, such as potential privacy and security risks, limited functionality, and heavy reliance on web connectivity.\n\n Ultimately, choosing an appropriate free online PDF converter should first and foremost align with your needs and concerns. By weighing the pros and cons we’ve just mentioned above, you can hopefully make an informed choice to enhance your workflow while safeguarding your data.\n\n And if you don’t have the time or patience to search for a solution, test drive MobiPDF with a 14-day trial – we’re confident you won’t regret it!"

If the layout changes, keep hunting.\n\nCheck for the displacement of headers and footers, numbers on tables, page numbers, image placement, and spacing between paragraphs. Other problems may include combining columns for Excel documents, which is frustrating and time-consuming to re-edit.\n\nYou can try a free online PDF converter like Sizle that will completely maintain the format and resolution of your document.\n\nA PDF converter with fast processing power is crucial for efficiency. In most cases, any PDF converter on your desktop or mobile phone works as fast as your device. The higher your computer’s processing power and configuration, the better the conversion speeds will be.\n\nHowever, online PDF converters work as fast as the software server’s performance, your internet speed, and the size of your file. Fortunately, you can increase the conversion speed by compressing your PDF document.\n\nTo do this:\n• Drag and drop the document to be compressed or import from your drive.\n• Open the converter and upload the compressed PDF for conversion.\n\nIf you are using a PDF converter saved on your computer, the risk of losing the document or breaching critical information is significantly lowered. However, these applications and documents consume storage space. A great alternative is an online PDF converter.\n\nThere are hundreds of free online PDF converters, but not all are safe to use. It’s essential to consider the security of your email and documents when you register for a free online PDF converter. Work with a PDF converter with a credible reputation, reviews, and great user experience.\n\nCheck if the site supports automatic deletion of files or manual deletion. Also, check if the site has SSL encryption for your files. SSL encryption ensures that all your files and personal information are safe. You can also limit the PDF converter’s access to your files.\n\nYou can choose a site that doesn’t require registration or email submission for one-time use. However, work with a reputable online converter if you are converting critical personal information, business contracts, legal files, or financial documents.\n\nAs earlier mentioned, when you work with desktop software, you have to save the documents on your device. Fortunately, working with an online PDF converter is a great way to use cloud storage. You have to register to access cloud storage in most cases, but the benefits outweigh any downsides.\n\nWith cloud-based applications, you can access your files online no matter where you are, upload documents on the move and convert and share access online. Cloud storage also preserves your files outside the device, which means that even if you lose a device, you can keep your documents intact.\n\nWorking on the cloud also saves your work as your edit. Instead of hitting the save button every time you edit, the application automatically saves the changes. If you log out suddenly, you can return to the exact position you left off. In short, having an online PDF converter ensures efficiency.\n\nAlso, cloud-based applications are automatically up-to-date. You don’t have to download the updates to your device or miss critical security patches. Instead, the developer takes care of the updates and security, and you can focus on your work.\n\nIf you are working on a project with a team, it’s best to select a PDF converter that supports teams. For example, Sizle supports two users in the free version and more than ten users, depending on your monthly subscription. Sizle is more than a PDF converter. It’s a secure document collaboration tool that supports conversions from many file formats. Multiple users can upload and convert documents, track changes, and share files. Also, you can share documents with individuals and companies and see when those files are opened and engaged with.\n\nCollaboration ensures efficiency and speed when working on a project. For example, instead of downloading each PDF file and sending it to individual emails, you can give the recipient access to the documents online. You can also work on multiple documents from different geographical locations without affecting work quality or deadlines.\n\nSometimes, you need to convert several files into PDFs or combine and merge PDF documents a single PDF file. Batch conversion saves time because you don’t have to wait for each file to convert before selecting another. Check if your PDF converter allows you to convert multiple files from multiple cloud drives and saving to different drives once done.\n\nMultitasking on an online PDF converter can happen on multiple tabs. If you need to open several tabs, check if it affects the processing speed. Overall, multitasking can save you the time required to upload, convert and download documents.\n\nWhen working with offline or desktop software, compatibility is critical. The software needs to be compatible with your device, either Mac or Windows, among other device requirements.\n\n Fortunately, with Sizle, a free online PDF converter, you don’t have to worry about compatibility. You can upload and convert files wherever you are as long as you are connected to the internet.\n\nOnline PDF converters are easy to access on smartphones, tabs, and desktop computers. You can enjoy a seamless experience across all devices without worrying about your processing speeds, storage, or any other compatibility issues.\n\nWhen selecting a PDF converter, choose one that integrates with other apps, especially cloud drives like Dropbox and Google Drive. A seamless cloud experience improves efficiency when transferring documents across applications and devices. Suppose you select a PDF converter that you cannot integrate with Google Drive or OneDrive. In this case, you might download the document to your device, then upload it to the application on your desktop or online.\n\nAfter converting the file to PDF, you have to download it and then go to a different application to share it. As you can imagine, this process is challenging and time-wasting. For example, when you save a file on Google Drive, you can access it through Sizle, import it for conversion, and save it once again in your Google Drive.\n\nYou can also create documents on Sizle and share them with multiple recipients. There is no need to move through numerous applications when you can do it on one platform.\n\nWhile there are many free PDF converters on the internet, few have a great user experience. A simple, clean and professional application makes it easy to manage your documents. The features and instructions should be easy to read and access on the interface.\n\nSizle has a neat and straightforward interface for novice and experienced users.\n\nYou can access your:\n\nYou can access all of this on a single screen. There are also shortcuts for activity and the latest document, making it easy to navigate files, especially during collaboration.\n\n SIzle’s powerful, user-friendly interface makes it easy to share documents on the platform with clients and customers without affecting your brand image.\n\nWith the Sizle PDF converter, you can enjoy PDF conversion to any editable format and vice versa.
