        "document": "Use the Video Player componentA functional part of a GameObject. A GameObject can contain any number of components. Unity has many built-in components, and you can create your own by writing scripts that inherit from MonoBehaviour. More info\n\nSee in Glossary to attach video files to GameObjectsThe fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. More info\n\nSee in Glossary, and play them on the GameObject’s TextureAn image used when rendering a GameObject, Sprite, or UI element. Textures are often applied to the surface of a mesh to give it visual detail. More info\n\nSee in Glossary at run time.\n\nThe screenshot below shows a Video Player component attached to a spherical GameObject.\n\nBy default, the Material Property of a Video Player component is set to a GameObject’s main texture, which means that when the Video Player component is attached to a GameObject that has a Renderer, it automatically assigns itself to the Texture on that Renderer (because this is the main Texture for the GameObject). Here, the GameObject has a MeshThe main graphics primitive of Unity. Meshes make up a large part of your 3D worlds. Unity supports triangulated or Quadrangulated polygon meshes. Nurbs, Nurms, Subdiv surfaces must be converted to polygons. More info\n\nSee in Glossary Renderer component, so the Video Player automatically assigns it to the Renderer field, which means the Video Clip plays on the Mesh RendererA mesh component that takes the geometry from the Mesh Filter and renders it at the position defined by the object’s Transform component. More info\n\nSee in Glossary’s Texture.\n\nYou can also set a specific target for the video to play on, including:\n• None A CameraA component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a texture. More info\n\nSee in Glossary plane\n• None A Render TextureA special type of Texture that is created and updated at runtime. To use them, first create a new Render Texture and designate one of your Cameras to render into it. Then you can use the Render Texture in a Material just like a regular Texture. More info\n\nSee in Glossary\n• None A MaterialAn asset that defines how a surface should be rendered. More info\n\nSee in Glossary Texture parameter\n\nChoose the source type of your video. Select the Video Clip to assign to the Video Player component. This isn’t supported on the Web platform. Enter the URL (for example, http:// or file://) of the video you want to assign to the Video Player. Set the clock source that the Video Player component uses to update its timing. Use the same clock source that processes audio. Use the same clock source as the game clock. This clock source is affected by the time scaling and capture frame rate settings. Use the same clock source as the game clock but without being affected by time scaling or capture frame rate. Play On Awake \n\n Set this to true to make an Audio Source start playing on awake More info Play the video when the Scene \n\n A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. More info launches. Clear it if you want to trigger the video playback at another point during runtime. Trigger it via scripting with the command. Wait for the first frame of the source video to be ready for display before the game starts. Clear it to keep the video time in sync with the rest of the game, which might cause the first few frames to be discarded. Loop the source video when it reaches its end. Clear it to stop playing the video when it reaches the end. When you enable this option, and the Video Player component detects drift between the playback position and the game clock, the Video Player skips ahead. When you disable this option, the Video Player doesn’t correct for drift and systematically plays all frames. Set a multiplier for the playback speed, as a value between 0 and 10. This is set to 1 (normal speed) by default. If the field is set to 2, the video plays at two times its normal speed. Choose how the video will render. Render the video on the Camera’s far plane. Render the video on the Camera’s near plane. Render the video into a selected Texture property of a GameObject through its Renderer’s Material. Render the video into the VideoPlayer.texture Scripting API property. You must use scripting to assign the Texture to its intended destination. Set the global transparency level to add to the source video. This allows elements behind the plane to be visible through it. For more information about alpha channels, refer to video transparency support. Choose the layout of 3D content in the source video. Video has 3D content where the left eye occupies the left half and right eye occupies the right half of video frames. Video has 3D content where the left eye occupies the upper half and right eye occupies the lower half of video frames. Define the Render Texture where the Video Player component renders its images. Aspect Ratio \n\n The relationship of an image’s proportional dimensions, such as its width and height. Set the aspect ratio of the images that fill the Camera Near Plane, Camera Far Plane, or Render Texture when the corresponding Render Mode is used. No scaling is used. The video is centered on the destination rectangle. Scale the source to fit the destination rectangle vertically, cropping the left and right sides or leaving black areas on each side if necessary. The source aspect ratio is preserved. Scale the source to fit the destination rectangle horizontally, cropping the top and bottom regions or leaving black areas above and below if needed. The source aspect ratio is preserved. Scale the source to fit the destination rectangle without having to crop. Leaves black areas on the left and right or above and below as needed. The source aspect ratio is preserved. Scale the source to fit the destination rectangle without leaving black areas on the left and right or above and below, cropping as required. The source aspect ratio is preserved. Scale both horizontally or vertically to fit the destination rectangle. The source aspect ratio isn’t preserved. Select the Renderer where the Video Player component renders its images. When set to None, the Renderer on the same GameObject as the Video Player component is used. When you enable this option, the Video Player component selects the Renderer’s main texture automatically. When you disable this option, you can set the Material Property option manually. The name of the Material Texture property that receives the Video Player component images. Define how the source’s audio tracks are output. Audio samples are sent to selected audio sources \n\n A component which plays back an Audio Clip in the scene to an audio listener or through an audio mixer. More info , enabling Unity’s audio processing to be applied. Audio samples are sent directly to the audio output hardware, bypassing Unity’s audio processing. Audio samples are sent to the associated AudioSampleProvider. The number of audio tracks in the video.\n\n\n\nOnly shown when Source is URL. When Source is Video Clip, the number of tracks is determined by examining the video file. Enable the associated audio track to use for playback. This must be set prior to playback.\n\n\n\nThe text to the left of the checkbox provides information about the audio track, specifically the track number, language, and number of channels.\n\n\n\nWhen the source is a URL, this information is only available during playback.\n\n\n\nThis property only appears if your source is a Video Clip that has an audio track (or tracks), or your source is a URL (allowing you to indicate how many tracks are expected from the URL during playback). The audio source through which the audio track is played. The targeted audio source can also play Audio Clips.\n\n\n\nThe audio source’s playback controls ( and in scripting API) don’t apply to the video source’s audio track.\n\n\n\nThis property only appears when the Audio Output Mode is set to Audio Source. Mute the associated audio track. In Audio Source mode, the audio source’s control is used.\n\n\n\nThis property only appears when the Audio Output Mode is set to Direct. Volume of the associated audio track. In Audio Source mode, the audio source’s volume is used.\n\n\n\nThis property only appears when the Audio Output Mode is set to Direct.\n\nThe following script demonstrates a few of the Video Player component’s features."
