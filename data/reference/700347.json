To install this on macOS or Ubuntu 18.04, follow the steps in How to Install Node.js and Create a Local Development Environment on macOS or the Installing Using a PPA section of How To Install Node.js on Ubuntu 18.04.\n• A new React project set up with Create React App by following the How to Set up a React Project with Create React App tutorial.\n• It will also help to have a basic understanding of JavaScript, which you can find in the How To Code in JavaScript series, along with a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.\n\nThis tutorial was verified with Node.js v16.13.1, npm v8.1.4, v17.0.2, and v0.24.0.\n\nIn this section, you will add Axios to a React project you created following the How to Set up a React Project with Create React App tutorial.\n\nTo add Axios to the project, open your terminal and change directories into your project:\n\nThen run this command to install Axios:\n\nNext, you will need to import Axios into the file you want to use it in.\n\nIn this example, you create a new component and import Axios into it to send a request.\n\nInside your React project, you will need to create a new component named .\n\nFirst, create a new subdirectory in the directory:\n\nIn this directory, create and add the following code to the component:\n\nFirst, you import React and Axios so that both can be used in the component. Then you hook into the lifecycle hook and perform a request.\n\nYou use with a URL from an API endpoint to get a promise which returns a response object. Inside the response object, there is data that is then assigned the value of .\n\nYou can also get other information about the request, such as the status code under or more information inside of .\n\nAdd this component to your :\n\nView the application in the browser.

        "document": "React is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces, and it works seamlessly with various data-fetching tools. Among these tools, Axios stands out as one of the easiest and most efficient libraries for making HTTP requests in React.\n\nIn this article, we’ll explore how to use Axios in a React application, making requests, handling responses, and handling errors.\n\nAxios is a promise-based HTTP client for JavaScript, which is used to make HTTP requests to fetch or send data to a server. It simplifies the process of handling requests by providing a cleaner API, better error handling, and support for features like request/response interceptors, cancellation, and more. It is also fully compatible with modern browsers and can be used in both the browser and NodeJS environments.\n• None Works in both NodeJS and browsers.\n• None Allows easy handling of timeouts and cancellation of requests.\n• None Supports making GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and other HTTP requests.\n\nBefore you install Axios your React project app should be ready to install this library.\n\nBefore we start making HTTP requests with Axios, you need to install it. If you’re starting a new React project, create one first using create-react-app (if you haven’t already).\n\nTo install Axios, run the following command in your React project’s root directory:\n\nIn your React component, import Axios at the top\n\nInstall Axios library using the command given below\n\nLet’s start by looking at the two most common HTTP methods you’ll use: GET and POST.\n\nA GET request is used to retrieve data from an API. Here’s how to use Axios to fetch data from an API endpoint.\n• State Management: The component uses useState to manage three states: data (stores fetched data), loading (tracks if the data is still loading), and error (handles any error that occurs during the data fetch).\n• Data Fetching with Axios: Inside the useEffect hook, an API request is made using axios.get to fetch posts from the URL https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts. The response is stored in data, and loading is set to false when the fetch completes.\n• Conditional Rendering: If data is still loading, it displays “Loading…”. If an error occurs, it displays the error message. Otherwise, it renders a list of post titles from the fetched data.\n\nPOST requests are used to send data to the server. Let’s see how you can use Axios to send data via a POST request.\n• State Management: The component uses useState to manage the title, body, and responseMessage states, which store the user input and the response message from the API.\n• Form Handling and POST Request: On form submission (handleSubmit), a new post object is created with the title and body, and a POST request is made using axios.post to send the data to the API.\n• Response Handling: After the request, if successful, a success message is shown (“Post created successfully!”); if there’s an error, it displays an error message (“Error creating post”).\n\nError handling is an important part of working with HTTP requests. In the above examples, we used .catch() to handle any errors that occur during the request. However, Axios provides several ways to manage errors more efficiently:\n\nError Object: Axios provides an error object containing useful information such as the response status, error message, and more. We can access it like this:\n\nYou can use status codes to handle specific error cases, such as redirecting the user if a 401 Unauthorized error occurs, or showing a different message for a 404 Not Found error.\n\nBest Practices for Using Axios in React\n• Use Axios with async/await: For cleaner code, consider using async/await with Axios.\n• Use Axios Instances: For scalability and easier configuration, you can create Axios instances that can be reused across components.\n• Handle Loading States: Always handle loading and error states in your UI so users have feedback while waiting for data.\n\nWhen you send a request to the server, you receive a response object from the server with the properties given below…\n• data: You receive data from the server in payload form. This data is returned in form and parse back into a JavaScript object to you.\n• status: You get the HTTP code returned from the server.\n• headers: All the headers are sent back by the server.\n\nYou will get an error object if there will be a problem with the request. Promise will be rejected with an error object with the properties given\n\nAxios is a powerful and easy-to-use HTTP client that simplifies making API requests in React applications. With its built-in features like automatic JSON parsing, request and response interceptors, and error handling, Axios is an excellent choice for handling HTTP requests in your React projects."

        "document": "When developing a React application that interacts with a Spring backend, using Axios for HTTP requests can streamline your code and enhance its maintainability. Here are some best practices to follow, including common pitfalls and how to avoid them.\n\nBest Practice: Instead, configure a base URL and create an Axios instance to avoid repetition and make your code more manageable.\n\nUse the instance for requests:\n• This practice helps avoid the redundancy of writing the full URL in every request, making the code cleaner and easier to refactor if the base URL changes.\n• In production, the base URL will likely change from localhost to a real domain. Having a single place to change the base URL minimizes errors and simplifies the deployment process.\n\nBest Practice: Create a service layer to manage API interactions, enhancing reusability and organization.\n\nUse the service layer in your components:\n• Centralizing API logic keeps your components cleaner and focuses them on UI logic. It also makes API calls reusable across different components.\n• In a large application, this practice ensures that any changes to API calls (like adding headers or changing endpoints) need to be made in one place, reducing the risk of bugs.\n\nBest Practice: Create a centralized error handling mechanism to handle different types of errors consistently.\n• In production, it ensures that users receive meaningful error messages and that errors are logged appropriately for debugging.\n\nBest Practice: Use async/await for cleaner and more readable asynchronous code.\n• This reduces the likelihood of nesting multiple .then calls, which can lead to harder-to-read and error-prone code.\n\nBest Practice: Use request interceptors to add common configurations like authentication tokens.\n• This helps in managing headers like authorization tokens centrally, ensuring all requests carry necessary headers without repetition.\n• In production, it simplifies adding or changing request configurations, ensuring all requests are uniformly managed.\n\nIf your application requires HTTP instead of HTTPS, such as during local development, you can configure Axios accordingly.\n\nBest Practice: Explicitly set the httpsAgent option to false when creating an Axios instance.\n• Disabling HTTPS is useful in a local development environment where setting up HTTPS can be cumbersome and unnecessary.\n• This practice should only be used in non-production environments. For production, always use HTTPS to ensure the security of data transmission.\n\nBy following these best practices, you ensure that your Axios requests in a React application interacting with a Spring backend are efficient, maintainable, and scalable. This approach helps in managing API calls effectively, making the codebase cleaner and more professional."

        "document": "Majorly busy listening to songs, scrolling Reddit and reading other’s articles. And yeah, also a senior frontend engineer with 4+ years of experience, crafting performant and stunning UI using React, Next.js, JavaScript, TailwindCSS, TypeScript.\n\nHowever, as applications grow in complexity, it becomes necessary to organize code and adopt best practices for maintainability, scalability, and readability. In this blog post, we will explore a separation of concerns approach in React using Axios. We will demonstrate how to structure your code by leveraging abstraction layering and modularization techniques.\n\nBut before we dive into the details, let's briefly discuss Axios and its benefits.\n\nAxios is a popular JavaScript library that simplifies making HTTP requests. It provides an easy-to-use API for performing GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and other types of HTTP requests. Axios supports promises, allowing you to handle asynchronous operations elegantly using async/await syntax.\n\nSome key benefits of using Axios include:\n\nAxios provides a simple and intuitive API for making HTTP requests, making it easy to get started.\n• Promise-based: Axios leverages JavaScript promises, enabling you to handle asynchronous operations in a more readable and efficient manner.\n• Interceptors: Axios allows you to intercept requests and responses, enabling you to modify or handle them globally.\n\nNow that we have a basic understanding of Axios let's explore how to structure your code using separation of concerns.\n\nSeparation of concerns is a software design principle that encourages splitting a program into distinct sections, each responsible for a specific aspect of functionality. In the context of React applications, this principle helps in organizing code, improving code maintainability, and making it easier to understand and modify.\n\nWhen using Axios in a React project, it's beneficial to separate the concerns related to API requests and data management from the components themselves. This separation promotes code reusability, modularity, and testability.\n\nTo achieve this, we can follow a three-layered architecture consisting of:\n\nThe service layer encapsulates the logic for making API requests using Axios. It abstracts away the details of API endpoints, request configurations, and error handling. This layer allows us to centralize API-related code and reuse it throughout the application.\n\nHere's an example of how a service layer using Axios can be implemented:\n\nBy centralizing API logic in the service layer, we can easily reuse these methods throughout the application, avoiding duplication and promoting code consistency.\n\nThe data layer acts as an intermediary between the components and the service layer. Its primary responsibility is to manage data retrieval, transformation, and caching.\n\nIn this layer, we consume the API service methods from the service layer and adapt the responses to suit the needs of our components. Additionally, we can implement caching strategies or handle complex data transformations specific to our application requirements.\n\nHere's an example of a data layer module that interacts with the service layer:\n\nIn this example, we consume the fetchUsers and createUser methods from the service layer and return the transformed data to the components. We handle any potential errors within the data layer, allowing the components to focus solely on rendering and user interactions.\n\nThe component layer is responsible for rendering the UI and handling user interactions. It consumes data from the data layer and updates the data when required.\n\nComponents should be kept as lean as possible, with minimal business logic. They should mainly focus on rendering the UI, handling user input, and triggering actions when necessary.\n\nHere's an example of how a component can consume data from the data layer:\n\nIn this example, the UserList component uses the getUsers function from the data layer to fetch a list of users. It then renders the list of users and provides a button to add a new user, which calls the addUser function from the data layer.\n\nBy separating concerns and following the three-layered architecture, we achieve cleaner, more maintainable, and testable code. Changes to the API service or data layer won't affect the components, making it easier to refactor and scale the application.\n\nBest Practices for Using Axios in React\n\nNow that we have established the three-layered architecture and separation of concerns, let's delve deeper into some best practices and techniques for using Axios in your React applications.\n\nIn modern web applications, making POST requests is a common requirement for sending data to the server. Axios makes it straightforward to handle POST requests using its post method.\n\nIn this example, we use Axios to send a POST request to the server with the data object as the request payload. The post method returns a promise, and we use await to handle the asynchronous response.\n\nTo use Axios in your React components, you need to import it. Make sure you have installed Axios as a dependency in your project before importing it.\n\nBy importing Axios directly into the components where you need it, you ensure that each component can handle its own data requests independently.\n\nTo leverage the full power of Axios, take advantage of JavaScript's async/await syntax when making API requests. This allows you to write cleaner and more readable code for handling asynchronous operations.\n\nBy using async/await, you can avoid callback hell and write synchronous-looking code while still handling asynchronous operations gracefully.\n\nAxios allows you to create custom instances with specific configurations. This can be beneficial when you need different base URLs or headers for different parts of your application.\n\nWith this custom instance, you can use the customAxios object to perform API requests, and it will automatically use the specified configuration.\n\nAxios allows you to intercept requests and responses using interceptors. This is useful for performing actions like adding headers to all requests or handling errors globally.\n\nWith interceptors, you can perform actions like adding authentication headers or handling common errors across all API requests.\n\nAxios provides specific error objects for different types of errors that can occur during an API request. Handle errors gracefully to provide a better user experience.\n\nBy differentiating between different error types, you can provide more informative error messages and handle issues appropriately.\n\nIn some cases, you might want to cancel an ongoing API request, especially if the user navigates away from a component before the request is completed. Axios supports request cancellation using the CancelToken.\n\nBy canceling ongoing requests, you can prevent unnecessary data fetching and improve the performance of your application.\n\nIn React, when using useEffect for making API requests or other side effects, it's essential to clean up after the component is unmounted. Otherwise, it may lead to memory leaks or unexpected behavior.\n\nBy using the isMounted variable, we ensure that the state is only updated when the component is still mounted, preventing potential memory leaks.\n\nWhile testing React components that use Axios, you may want to mock the API calls to isolate component testing from external dependencies.\n\nBy using jest.mock('axios'), we mock the Axios module, and by using axios.get.mockResolvedValueOnce, we set the mock response for the API call. This way, the component can be tested without making actual API requests.\n\nTo further enhance code modularity and reusability, you can create custom hooks that wrap Axios calls and manage the API logic.\n\nWith this custom hook, you can easily reuse the API call logic in multiple components, reducing redundancy and promoting code consistency.\n\nBy leveraging custom hooks, you can create a reusable interface for making API requests and handling responses.\n\nWhile Axios provides an excellent foundation for handling API requests, it's worth exploring additional tools and libraries that can enhance your development experience.

If you're building apps that need to communicate with servers (and let's face it, who isn't?), you've probably encountered the challenge of managing API requests. But worry not; Axios is here to save the day! This superhero of HTTP clients for JavaScript is promise-based, super flexible, and packed with features that make API management a breeze. Let's explore why Axios is the perfect replacement for and how it can boost your confidence in writing cleaner and more effective code.\n• None An In-Depth Guide for Front-End Development with React\n• None 7 Best React State Management Libraries for Any Project Size\n• None Top 6 Best React Component Libraries for Your Projects\n\nWhat Makes Axios the Perfect Replacement for ?\n\nThe API is a standard go-to when handling HTTP requests in JavaScript. But let's be honest, can be a bit… bare-bones. Here's why Axios is often a better choice.\n\nEase of Use and Simplicity\n\nWith , you have to handle response parsing manually, which can become cumbersome. Axios, on the other hand, automatically transforms JSON data. Here's a quick comparison:\n\nIt's clear to see that Axios offers a concise way to handle HTTP requests, reducing redundant code. It returns promises for better asynchronous code readability, improving web development efficiency.\n\nAxios, superior to , streamlines HTTP requests with built-in features like automatic JSON data transformation, request and response interceptors, robust error handling, and default configuration settings. While both support request cancellation via , Axios simplifies API management with its flexible API.\n\nThe table below highlights the key differences between Axios and , showcasing why Axios is often the better choice for managing API requests in JavaScript applications:\n\nAxios allows you to create instances with custom configurations, ensuring consistent and clean API calls throughout your application.\n\nWith this setup, every request you make with this instance will have the same base URL, timeout, and headers.\n\nInterceptors in Axios act like the secret agents of your HTTP requests, allowing you to intercept and modify requests and responses. This is perfect for adding authentication tokens or handling specific status codes globally.\n\nAxios supports for request cancellation, making it easier and more aligned with modern JavaScript practices.\n\nThis functionality is handy for scenarios where you might need to cancel outdated or unnecessary API calls, improving the overall performance and responsiveness of your React application.\n\nRefer to the flowchart below to further illustrate how request cancellation works in Axios using AbortController. This diagram visualizes the process, from creating the and making the request with the controller's signal to handling both the successful completion and the cancellation of the request.\n\nAre you tired of repeating yourself? Set up default configurations in Axios to maintain consistency and reduce redundancy in your code.\n\nWith these defaults, your API requests will always be configured correctly, reducing boilerplate code and streamlining your development process.\n\nSetting up a custom Axios instance helps maintain consistency across your application.\n\nInterceptors are perfect for handling tasks like adding authentication tokens to every request or managing global response scenarios.\n\nStructure your API calls into service modules for better maintainability.\n\nLet's integrate Axios with a backend API, focusing on authentication and token management. Suppose we have an authentication endpoint that returns a token, and we need to refresh this token periodically.\n\nIn this example, we set up two crucial interceptors to manage token authentication effectively:\n• Request Interceptor: This interceptor checks for a stored token in the local storage and, if found, injects it into the Authorization header of every outgoing request. This ensures that all API calls made through this Axios instance are authenticated without requiring manual intervention for each request.\n• Response Interceptor: This interceptor handles cases where the server responds with a 401 Unauthorized error. When such an error occurs, and if a refresh token exists, the interceptor attempts to refresh the access token by calling a separate API endpoint. If the token refresh is successful, the new token is stored in local storage, and the original request is retried with the new token. This automatic token refresh mechanism ensures seamless authentication without user intervention, providing a smoother user experience.\n\nBy incorporating these interceptors, you can ensure that your API requests remain authenticated and handle token expiration gracefully. This setup reduces the need for repetitive code and makes your application more robust and secure.\n\n>> You may be interested in React coding topics:\n• None The Best React Design Patterns with Code Examples\n\nAnd there you have it!
