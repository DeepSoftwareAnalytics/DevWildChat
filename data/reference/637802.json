        "document": "This feature is well established and works across many devices and browser versions. It’s been available across browsers since July 2015 . * Some parts of this feature may have varying levels of support.\n\nThe method of the interface repeatedly calls a function or executes a code snippet, with a fixed time delay between each call. This method returns an interval ID which uniquely identifies the interval, so you can remove it later by calling .\n\nA to be executed every milliseconds. The first execution happens after milliseconds. An optional syntax allows you to include a string instead of a function, which is compiled and executed every milliseconds. This syntax is not recommended for the same reasons that make using a security risk. The time, in milliseconds (thousandths of a second), the timer should delay in between executions of the specified function or code. Defaults to 0 if not specified. See Delay restrictions below for details on the permitted range of values. Additional arguments which are passed through to the function specified by func once the timer expires.\n\nThe returned is a numeric, non-zero value which identifies the timer created by the call to ; this value can be passed to to cancel the interval. It may be helpful to be aware that and share the same pool of IDs, and that and can technically be used interchangeably. For clarity, however, you should try to always match them to avoid confusion when maintaining your code. Note: The argument is converted to a signed 32-bit integer. This effectively limits to 2147483647 ms, roughly 24.8 days, since it's specified as a signed integer in the IDL.\n\nCode executed by runs in a separate execution context than the function from which it was called. As a consequence, the keyword for the called function is set to the (or ) object, it is not the same as the value for the function that called . See the following example (which uses instead of – the problem, in fact, is the same for both timers): myArray = [\"zero\", \"one\", \"two\"]; myArray.myMethod = function (sProperty) { alert(arguments.length > 0 ? this[sProperty] : this); }; myArray.myMethod(); // prints \"zero,one,two\" myArray.myMethod(1); // prints \"one\" setTimeout(myArray.myMethod, 1000); // prints \"[object Window]\" after 1 second setTimeout(myArray.myMethod, 1500, \"1\"); // prints \"undefined\" after 1.5 seconds // Passing the 'this' object with .call won't work // because this will change the value of this inside setTimeout itself // while we want to change the value of this inside myArray.myMethod. // In fact, it will be an error because setTimeout code expects this to be the window object: setTimeout.call(myArray, myArray.myMethod, 2000); // error: \"NS_ERROR_XPC_BAD_OP_ON_WN_PROTO: Illegal operation on WrappedNative prototype object\" setTimeout.call(myArray, myArray.myMethod, 2500, 2); // same error As you can see there are no ways to pass the object to the callback function in the legacy JavaScript.\n\nAll modern JavaScript runtimes (in browsers and elsewhere) support arrow functions, with lexical — allowing us to write if we're inside the method. If you need to support IE, use the method, which lets you specify the value that should be used as for all calls to a given function. That lets you easily bypass problems where it's unclear what will be, depending on the context from which your function was called.\n\nThe function is commonly used to set a delay for functions that are executed again and again, such as animations. You can cancel the interval using . If you wish to have your function called once after the specified delay, use .\n\nIt's possible for intervals to be nested; that is, the callback for can in turn call to start another interval running, even though the first one is still going. To mitigate the potential impact this can have on performance, once intervals are nested beyond five levels deep, the browser will automatically enforce a 4 ms minimum value for the interval. Attempts to specify a value less than 4 ms in deeply-nested calls to will be pinned to 4 ms. Browsers may enforce even more stringent minimum values for the interval under some circumstances, although these should not be common. Note also that the actual amount of time that elapses between calls to the callback may be longer than the given ; see Reasons for delays longer than specified for examples.\n\nEnsure that execution duration is shorter than interval frequency If there is a possibility that your logic could take longer to execute than the interval time, it is recommended that you recursively call a named function using . For example, if using to poll a remote server every 5 seconds, network latency, an unresponsive server, and a host of other issues could prevent the request from completing in its allotted time. As such, you may find yourself with queued up XHR requests that won't necessarily return in order. In these cases, a recursive pattern is preferred: In the above snippet, a named function is declared and is immediately executed. is recursively called inside after the logic has completed executing. While this pattern does not guarantee execution on a fixed interval, it does guarantee that the previous interval has completed before recursing."

        "document": "We may decide to execute a function not right now, but at a certain time later. That’s called “scheduling a call”.\n\nThere are two methods for it:\n• allows us to run a function once after the interval of time.\n• allows us to run a function repeatedly, starting after the interval of time, then repeating continuously at that interval.\n\nThese methods are not a part of JavaScript specification. But most environments have the internal scheduler and provide these methods. In particular, they are supported in all browsers and Node.js.\n\nFor instance, this code calls after one second:\n\nIf the first argument is a string, then JavaScript creates a function from it.\n\nSo, this will also work:\n\nBut using strings is not recommended, use arrow functions instead of them, like this:\n\nA call to returns a “timer identifier” that we can use to cancel the execution.\n\nIn the code below, we schedule the function and then cancel it (changed our mind). As a result, nothing happens:\n\nAs we can see from output, in a browser the timer identifier is a number. In other environments, this can be something else. For instance, Node.js returns a timer object with additional methods.\n\nAgain, there is no universal specification for these methods, so that’s fine.\n\nFor browsers, timers are described in the timers section of HTML Living Standard.\n\nThe method has the same syntax as :\n\nAll arguments have the same meaning. But unlike it runs the function not only once, but regularly after the given interval of time.\n\nTo stop further calls, we should call .\n\nThe following example will show the message every 2 seconds. After 5 seconds, the output is stopped:\n\nThere are two ways of running something regularly.\n\nOne is . The other one is a nested , like this:\n\nThe above schedules the next call right at the end of the current one .\n\nThe nested is a more flexible method than . This way the next call may be scheduled differently, depending on the results of the current one.\n\nFor instance, we need to write a service that sends a request to the server every 5 seconds asking for data, but in case the server is overloaded, it should increase the interval to 10, 20, 40 seconds…\n\nAnd if the functions that we’re scheduling are CPU-hungry, then we can measure the time taken by the execution and plan the next call sooner or later.\n\nNested allows to set the delay between the executions more precisely than .\n\nLet’s compare two code fragments. The first one uses :\n\nThe second one uses nested :\n\nFor the internal scheduler will run every 100ms:\n\nThe real delay between calls for is less than in the code!\n\nThat’s normal, because the time taken by ’s execution “consumes” a part of the interval.\n\nIt is possible that ’s execution turns out to be longer than we expected and takes more than 100ms.\n\nIn this case the engine waits for to complete, then checks the scheduler and if the time is up, runs it again immediately.\n\nIn the edge case, if the function always executes longer than ms, then the calls will happen without a pause at all.\n\nAnd here is the picture for the nested :\n\nThe nested guarantees the fixed delay (here 100ms).\n\nThat’s because a new call is planned at the end of the previous one.\n\nThere’s a special use case: , or just .\n\nThis schedules the execution of as soon as possible. But the scheduler will invoke it only after the currently executing script is complete.\n\nSo the function is scheduled to run “right after” the current script.\n\nFor instance, this outputs “Hello”, then immediately “World”:\n\nThe first line “puts the call into calendar after 0ms”. But the scheduler will only “check the calendar” after the current script is complete, so is first, and – after it.\n\nThere are also advanced browser-related use cases of zero-delay timeout, that we’ll discuss in the chapter Event loop: microtasks and macrotasks.\n\nZero delay is in fact not zero (in a browser) In the browser, there’s a limitation of how often nested timers can run. The HTML Living Standard says: “after five nested timers, the interval is forced to be at least 4 milliseconds.”. Let’s demonstrate what it means with the example below. The call in it re-schedules itself with zero delay. Each call remembers the real time from the previous one in the array. What do the real delays look like? Let’s see: let start = Date.now(); let times = []; setTimeout(function run() { times.push(Date.now() - start); // remember delay from the previous call if (start + 100 < Date.now()) alert(times); // show the delays after 100ms else setTimeout(run); // else re-schedule }); // an example of the output: // 1,1,1,1,9,15,20,24,30,35,40,45,50,55,59,64,70,75,80,85,90,95,100 First timers run immediately (just as written in the spec), and then we see . The 4+ ms obligatory delay between invocations comes into play. The similar thing happens if we use instead of : runs few times with zero-delay, and afterwards with 4+ ms delay. That limitation comes from ancient times and many scripts rely on it, so it exists for historical reasons. For server-side JavaScript, that limitation does not exist, and there exist other ways to schedule an immediate asynchronous job, like setImmediate for Node.js. So this note is browser-specific.\n• Methods and allow us to run the once/regularly after milliseconds.\n• To cancel the execution, we should call with the value returned by .\n• Nested calls are a more flexible alternative to , allowing us to set the time between executions more precisely.\n• Zero delay scheduling with (the same as ) is used to schedule the call “as soon as possible, but after the current script is complete”.\n• The browser limits the minimal delay for five or more nested calls of or for (after 5th call) to 4ms. That’s for historical reasons.\n\nPlease note that all scheduling methods do not guarantee the exact delay.\n\nFor example, the in-browser timer may slow down for a lot of reasons:\n• The browser tab is in the background mode.\n• The laptop is on battery saving mode.\n\nAll that may increase the minimal timer resolution (the minimal delay) to 300ms or even 1000ms depending on the browser and OS-level performance settings."

        "document": "In this article, we'll explain what asynchronous programming is, why we need it, and briefly discuss some of the ways asynchronous functions have historically been implemented in JavaScript.\n• To gain familiarity with what asynchronous JavaScript is, how it differs from synchronous JavaScript, and why we need it.\n• What synchronous programming is, and why it can sometimes be problematic.\n• How asynchronous programming aims to solve these problems.\n• Event handlers and callback functions, and how they relate to asynchronous programming. Asynchronous programming is a technique that enables your program to start a potentially long-running task and still be able to be responsive to other events while that task runs, rather than having to wait until that task has finished. Once that task has finished, your program is presented with the result. Many functions provided by browsers, especially the most interesting ones, can potentially take a long time, and therefore, are asynchronous. For example:\n• Asking a user to select files using So even though you may not have to implement your own asynchronous functions very often, you are very likely to need to use them correctly. In this article, we'll start by looking at the problem with long-running synchronous functions, which make asynchronous programming a necessity.\n\nConsider the following code: const name = \"Miriam\"; const greeting = `Hello, my name is ${name}!`; console.log(greeting); // \"Hello, my name is Miriam!\"\n• Declares another string called , which uses .\n• Outputs the greeting to the JavaScript console. We should note here that the browser effectively steps through the program one line at a time, in the order we wrote it. At each point, the browser waits for the line to finish its work before going on to the next line. It has to do this because each line depends on the work done in the preceding lines. That makes this a synchronous program. It would still be synchronous even if we called a separate function, like this: function makeGreeting(name) { return `Hello, my name is ${name}!`; } const name = \"Miriam\"; const greeting = makeGreeting(name); console.log(greeting); // \"Hello, my name is Miriam!\" Here, is a synchronous function because the caller has to wait for the function to finish its work and return a value before the caller can continue.\n\nThe next example is just like the last one, except we added a text box for you to type in. This time, click \"Generate primes\", and try typing in the text box immediately after. You'll find that while our function is running, our program is completely unresponsive: you can't type anything, click anything, or do anything else. <label for=\"quota\">Number of primes:</label> <input type=\"text\" id=\"quota\" name=\"quota\" value=\"1000000\" /> <button id=\"generate\">Generate primes</button> <button id=\"reload\">Reload</button> <textarea id=\"user-input\" rows=\"5\" cols=\"62\"> Try typing in here immediately after pressing \"Generate primes\" </textarea> <div id=\"output\"></div> const MAX_PRIME = 1000000; function isPrime(n) { for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(n); i++) { if (n % i === 0) { return false; } } return n > 1; } const random = (max) => Math.floor(Math.random() * max); function generatePrimes(quota) { const primes = []; while (primes.length < quota) { const candidate = random(MAX_PRIME); if (isPrime(candidate)) { primes.push(candidate); } } return primes; } const quota = document.querySelector(\"#quota\"); const output = document.querySelector(\"#output\"); document.querySelector(\"#generate\").addEventListener(\"click\", () => { const primes = generatePrimes(quota.value); output.textContent = `Finished generating ${quota.value} primes!`; }); document.querySelector(\"#reload\").addEventListener(\"click\", () => { document.location.reload(); }); The reason for this is that this JavaScript program is single-threaded. A thread is a sequence of instructions that a program follows. Because the program consists of a single thread, it can only do one thing at a time: so if it is waiting for our long-running synchronous call to return, it can't do anything else. What we need is a way for our program to:\n• Have that function start the operation and return immediately, so that our program can still be responsive to other events.\n• Have the function execute the operation in a way that does not block the main thread, for example by starting a new thread.\n• Notify us with the result of the operation when it eventually completes. That's precisely what asynchronous functions enable us to do. The rest of this module explains how they are implemented in JavaScript.\n\nThe description we just saw of asynchronous functions might remind you of event handlers, and if it does, you'd be right. Event handlers are really a form of asynchronous programming: you provide a function (the event handler) that will be called, not right away, but whenever the event happens. If \"the event\" is \"the asynchronous operation has completed\", then that event could be used to notify the caller about the result of an asynchronous function call. Some early asynchronous APIs used events in just this way. The API enables you to make HTTP requests to a remote server using JavaScript. Since this can take a long time, it's an asynchronous API, and you get notified about the progress and eventual completion of a request by attaching event listeners to the object. The following example shows this in action. Press \"Click to start request\" to send a request. We create a new and listen for its event. The handler logs a \"Finished!\" message along with the status code. After adding the event listener we send the request. Note that after this, we can log \"Started XHR request\": that is, our program can continue to run while the request is going on, and our event handler will be called when the request is complete. const log = document.querySelector(\".event-log\"); document.querySelector(\"#xhr\").addEventListener(\"click\", () => { log.textContent = \"\"; const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.addEventListener(\"loadend\", () => { log.textContent = `${log.textContent}Finished with status: ${xhr.status}`; }); xhr.open( \"GET\", \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/content/main/files/en-us/_wikihistory.json\", ); xhr.send(); log.textContent = `${log.textContent}Started XHR request\n\n`; }); document.querySelector(\"#reload\").addEventListener(\"click\", () => { log.textContent = \"\"; document.location.reload(); }); This is an event handler just the same as handlers for user actions such as the user clicking a button. This time, however, the event is a change in the state of an object.\n\nAn event handler is a particular type of callback. A callback is just a function that's passed into another function, with the expectation that the callback will be called at the appropriate time. As we just saw, callbacks used to be the main way asynchronous functions were implemented in JavaScript. However, callback-based code can get hard to understand when the callback itself has to call functions that accept a callback. This is a common situation if you need to perform some operation that breaks down into a series of asynchronous functions. For example, consider the following: Here we have a single operation that's split into three steps, where each step depends on the last step. In our example, the first step adds 1 to the input, the second adds 2, and the third adds 3. Starting with an input of 0, the end result is 6 (0 + 1 + 2 + 3). As a synchronous program, this is very straightforward. But what if we implemented the steps using callbacks? Because we have to call callbacks inside callbacks, we get a deeply nested function, which is much harder to read and debug. This is sometimes called \"callback hell\" or the \"pyramid of doom\" (because the indentation looks like a pyramid on its side). When we nest callbacks like this, it can also get very hard to handle errors: often you have to handle errors at each level of the \"pyramid\", instead of having error handling only once at the top level. For these reasons, most modern asynchronous APIs don't use callbacks. Instead, the foundation of asynchronous programming in JavaScript is the , and that's the subject of the next article."

        "document": "State management is the process of managing data in software applications. It reduces complexity when dealing with large amounts of data and states, and improves the performance of applications by optimizing the code. This article will explain what state management is, the benefits of using it, and the common libraries available. It will also give advice on setting up and using state management, debugging issues and best practices.\n\nState management is the process of storing data in an object or array in order to easily control and manipulate it. Its purpose is to make it easier to manage the data flow between different components and states within a web application. State management provides a unified way to manage complex data through a single source of truth. This makes it easier to debug and maintain code, as well as improve application performance.\n\nState management can also be used to store user preferences and settings, allowing for a more personalized experience. Additionally, state management can be used to store data that is used across multiple pages, such as a shopping cart or user authentication information. By using state management, developers can ensure that data is consistent and up-to-date across all components of the application.\n\nImplementing state management in a web application has several advantages. It enables developers to easily keep track of how a user interacts with the application, as well as allowing them to build consistent user experiences. State management also helps improve performance by reducing the amount of code needed, as well as reducing the time needed for debugging and troubleshooting.\n\nState management also helps to improve the security of an application by ensuring that only authorized users can access certain parts of the application. Additionally, it can help to reduce the amount of data that needs to be stored in the database, as the application can store the data in the state instead. This can help to reduce the load on the database, as well as improving the overall performance of the application.\n\nThere are several popular libraries available for managing state. The most popular are Redux, MobX, and NGXS. These libraries are all open-source and provide excellent documentation for implementing state management in web applications. Each library provides its own unique features, but all are powerful tools for managing state.\n\nRedux is a library that is based on the Flux architecture and is used to manage application state. It is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications and is used to store data that can be accessed from any component in the application. MobX is a library that is based on the Observer pattern and is used to manage application state. It is a reactive state management library that allows for easy tracking of changes in the application state. NGXS is a library that is based on the Redux architecture and is used to manage application state. It is a state management library that provides a simple and intuitive API for managing state in an application.\n\nSetting up state management requires some knowledge of the libraries being used and how they work. The most important step is creating a store. This is the main source of truth within a state management application, and is where all data stored and accessed. Once the store is set up, the developer can begin setting up the architecture of the application including components, routes, and actions.\n\nIt is important to consider the structure of the store when setting up state management. The store should be organized in a way that makes it easy to access and update data. Additionally, the store should be designed to be scalable, so that it can handle larger amounts of data as the application grows. Finally, the store should be designed to be secure, so that data is not compromised.\n\nState management allows developers to easily manipulate data in an application. To do this, actions must be set up which fire certain events whenever a certain type of data is changed. For example, an action may be set up to fire whenever a user adds an item to a shopping cart. The action can then update the store with the latest data and trigger any other events or processes that need to be implemented.\n\nState management also allows developers to easily debug their applications. By setting up actions to fire whenever data is changed, developers can easily identify any issues that may arise. This makes it easier to identify and fix any bugs or errors that may be present in the application.\n\nReacting to Changes in State Management\n\nAn important aspect of working with state management is reacting to changes. Whenever there is a change in the state, such as when a user adds an item to a shopping cart, the application needs to know how to respond. To do this, developers can create event listeners which listen for changes in the store and react accordingly. This allows developers to create a more dynamic application that can respond to user actions quickly and effectively.\n\nEvent listeners can be used to trigger a variety of different actions, such as updating the UI, sending a notification, or making an API call. By using event listeners, developers can ensure that their application is always up-to-date and responding to user actions in the most efficient way possible. Additionally, event listeners can be used to detect errors and log them for debugging purposes.\n\nDebugging state management can be difficult due to its complexity. To simplify this process, developers should establish a debugging workflow which allows them to quickly identify and fix any issues they encounter. This workflow should include inspecting the state after each action, running tests to make sure everything is working properly, and logging errors to make it easier to pinpoint where issues are occurring.\n\nIn addition, developers should also consider using debugging tools such as breakpoints and logging statements to help them identify and fix any issues they encounter. Breakpoints allow developers to pause the execution of their code at a certain point, allowing them to inspect the state of the application and identify any issues. Logging statements can also be used to log errors and other information which can be used to help identify and fix any issues.\n\nState management can be difficult because it requires detailed knowledge about the application and its data structures. It can be difficult to keep track of all of the different states that an application may need to handle. Additionally, there may be other challenges such as maintaining data consistency or handling asynchronous operations.\n\nAnother challenge with state management is ensuring that the application is able to respond to user input in a timely manner. This can be difficult to achieve if the application is not designed to handle large amounts of data or if the application is not optimized for performance. Additionally, state management can be difficult to debug, as it can be difficult to identify the source of any errors or unexpected behavior.\n\nThere are some general best practices for implementing state management that can make working with it easier. First, developer should always keep track of the application’s data structure by keeping an updated documentation or diagrams. They should also make sure that all components are decoupled from each other, so that changes in one component do not affect another component unintentionally. Finally, they should keep data consistency in mind when working with actions, so that all changes happen in a predictable way."

        "document": "State management is a crucial aspect of modern web development, especially when dealing with client-side rendering (CSR). As web applications become more dynamic and interactive, managing the state of various components efficiently becomes increasingly important. The state refers to the data that drives the behavior and appearance of your application at any given time. In client-side rendering, managing this state correctly ensures that your application remains responsive, consistent, and easy to maintain.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the fundamentals of state management in client-side rendering, discuss various approaches, and provide actionable insights on how to implement effective state management in your web applications. Whether you’re using React, Vue.js, Angular, or another JavaScript framework, understanding how to handle state properly is key to building robust and scalable web applications.\n\nIn the context of web development, state refers to the data that represents the current status of an application or component. This could include anything from user inputs, such as form data, to more complex data structures like a shopping cart in an e-commerce application.\n\nThe state determines what is displayed on the screen and how the application responds to user interactions.\n\nIn client-side rendering, the state is managed directly in the browser, meaning that any changes to the state immediately reflect in the user interface.\n\nThis approach provides a smooth and responsive experience for users, as updates to the state do not require a full page reload or additional server requests. However, managing state in this way also introduces challenges, particularly as the complexity of the application grows.\n\nProper state management is essential for maintaining the consistency and reliability of a web application. Without a well-structured approach to handling state, an application can quickly become difficult to manage, leading to bugs, performance issues, and a poor user experience.\n\nState management becomes particularly important in applications with many interactive components or those that require real-time data updates.\n\nFor example, in a social media application, the state might include the list of posts displayed on the user’s feed, the status of a like button, or the content of a new post being drafted.\n\nIf the state is not managed correctly, the user might see outdated posts, inconsistent button states, or lose the content they were typing.\n\nMoreover, state management plays a critical role in ensuring that an application is scalable. As the number of components and interactions within an application increases, so does the complexity of managing the state.\n\nA robust state management strategy helps to maintain performance and ensure that the application remains responsive, even as it grows in size and complexity.\n\nOne of the primary challenges in state management is ensuring that all parts of the application have access to the correct data at the right time. In a small application, this might be as simple as passing data between a few components.\n\nHowever, in a larger application, managing state across many components can become more complex.\n\nAnother challenge is maintaining the consistency of the state across the application. For instance, if multiple components rely on the same piece of data, ensuring that this data is kept consistent and updated correctly can be difficult.\n\nThis is especially true in applications that involve asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from an API. Handling these asynchronous operations without causing inconsistencies or performance issues requires careful planning and a solid understanding of how state is managed within your chosen framework.\n\nLastly, performance is a key consideration in state management. Updating the state can trigger re-renders of components, which, if not managed carefully, can lead to unnecessary or redundant updates that slow down the application.\n\nOptimizing these updates and ensuring that only the necessary components are re-rendered is critical for maintaining a fast and responsive user experience.\n\nDifferent JavaScript frameworks offer various tools and patterns for managing state. For example, React uses a component-based approach where each component can manage its own state internally, while also providing context and hooks for managing state across multiple components.\n\nVue.js offers a reactive data-binding system that automatically updates the user interface when the state changes, along with Vuex for more complex state management needs.\n\nAngular, on the other hand, uses services and dependency injection to manage state, along with RxJS for handling asynchronous data streams.\n\nThese frameworks provide the foundation for handling state in client-side rendering, but the specific implementation details can vary depending on the needs of your application. Understanding the tools and techniques available in your chosen framework is the first step toward effective state management.\n\nLocal state management refers to managing state within individual components. This approach is straightforward and works well for simple applications where each component manages its own data independently.\n\nFor instance, a form component might manage the state of its input fields, handling user input and validation directly within the component.\n\nIn frameworks like React, local state is typically managed using the hook, which allows you to define state variables within a component. When the state changes, the component re-renders, updating the user interface accordingly.\n\nThis approach keeps the state close to where it’s used, making it easy to understand and manage in small, isolated components.\n\nVue.js provides a similar mechanism with its reactive data properties, where each component can define its own data and methods for managing state. Angular also supports local state management through component properties and services.\n\nWhile local state management is simple and effective for smaller applications, it can become cumbersome as the application grows. When multiple components need to share or synchronize state, managing this state locally can lead to complex and hard-to-maintain code.\n\nAs applications grow in size and complexity, managing state across multiple components becomes more challenging. This is where global state management comes into play. Global state management involves centralizing the state in a single place, making it accessible to any component that needs it.\n\nIn React, global state management can be achieved using the Context API or state management libraries like Redux. The Context API allows you to create a context object that can be accessed by any component in the application tree, enabling components to share state without prop-drilling.\n\nRedux, on the other hand, provides a more robust solution by centralizing the entire application’s state in a single store. This store is then accessed and updated through actions and reducers, ensuring a predictable and consistent state management process.\n\nVue.js offers Vuex for global state management, which provides a centralized store for all the components in an application. Vuex allows components to access and update the state through defined actions and mutations, ensuring that the state remains consistent and predictable across the entire application.\n\nAngular uses services for global state management, where a service is injected into components that need access to shared state. These services can maintain state, handle data fetching, and even manage side effects, making it easier to keep the application’s state consistent and up-to-date.\n\nGlobal state management is essential for large applications where multiple components need to share data or respond to changes in the state.\n\nHowever, it can introduce additional complexity, so it’s important to carefully design the state management architecture to avoid issues like unnecessary re-renders or performance bottlenecks.\n\nThe choice between local and global state management depends on the specific needs of your application. For smaller applications with minimal state sharing between components, local state management might be sufficient.\n\nThis approach keeps the state management simple and localized, making the application easier to understand and maintain.\n\nHowever, as the application grows and more components need to interact with each other, global state management becomes necessary.\n\nCentralizing the state in a single place ensures that all components have access to the data they need, reducing the risk of inconsistencies and making it easier to manage the application’s state as a whole.\n\nIn some cases, a hybrid approach might be the best solution. For example, you might manage simple, isolated state locally within components while using a global state management solution for more complex or shared state.\n\nThis approach allows you to balance simplicity with scalability, ensuring that your state management strategy remains effective as your application evolves.\n\nOne of the more challenging aspects of state management in client-side rendering is dealing with asynchronous state changes, such as data fetching or user interactions that involve delays (e.g., submitting a form).\n\nHandling these asynchronous operations requires careful management to ensure that the state remains consistent and the user interface is updated correctly.\n\nIn React, handling asynchronous state changes often involves using hooks like in combination with state management libraries like Redux Thunk or Redux Saga.\n\nThese tools allow you to manage side effects (such as data fetching) in a way that integrates seamlessly with your global state management strategy.\n\nVue.js uses its reactive system to handle asynchronous state changes, often in combination with Vuex. Vuex actions can handle asynchronous operations and update the state accordingly, ensuring that the user interface remains responsive and consistent.\n\nAngular provides built-in tools for managing asynchronous operations, such as the service and RxJS, a library for reactive programming. RxJS allows you to work with asynchronous data streams, making it easier to manage complex state changes over time.\n\nHandling asynchronous state changes is critical for creating a responsive and reliable user experience. By leveraging the tools and patterns provided by your chosen framework, you can ensure that your application remains performant and consistent, even in the face of complex asynchronous interactions.\n\nOne of the fundamental principles of effective state management is to keep the state minimal and focused. This means only storing the data that is absolutely necessary for the application’s functionality and user experience.\n\nStoring too much data in the state can lead to unnecessary complexity, making the application harder to maintain and more prone to bugs.\n\nFor example, instead of storing derived data or calculations in the state, it’s often better to compute these values on-the-fly as needed. This reduces the amount of state that needs to be managed and ensures that the state remains clear and focused on the essential data.\n\nIn React, this might involve using memoization techniques to avoid recalculating values unnecessarily. Vue.js and Angular offer similar patterns, such as computed properties in Vue.js or Angular’s pipes, to derive values dynamically without cluttering the state.\n\nWhen dealing with complex data structures, such as arrays of objects or nested data, it’s important to normalize the data before storing it in the state.\n\nNormalization refers to the process of structuring the data in a flat format, where each piece of data is stored only once, and relationships between data are represented by references or IDs.\n\nNormalization helps prevent duplication of data and makes it easier to update or modify individual pieces of data without affecting other parts of the application. This is particularly important in global state management, where multiple components might need to access or update the same data.\n\nIn Redux, for instance, normalized state is a common pattern that helps keep the state manageable and consistent. By using libraries like normalizr, developers can easily structure their state in a normalized format, simplifying data updates and improving the overall performance of the application.\n\nAnother best practice is to separate the UI state from the business logic state. UI state refers to data that is related to the user interface, such as whether a modal is open or which tab is currently active.\n\nBusiness logic state, on the other hand, includes the core data that drives the application, such as user information, product data, or order details.\n\nSeparating these two types of state helps keep the application more organized and easier to manage. UI state is typically managed locally within the components that need it, while business logic state is often managed globally, allowing it to be accessed and updated across the application.\n\nIn React, this separation can be achieved by using local state hooks ( ) for UI state and global state management tools like Redux or Context for business logic state.\n\nIn Vue.js, you might manage UI state within components while using Vuex for more complex or shared business logic state. Angular allows similar patterns through its service architecture.\n\nImmutability is a key concept in state management, particularly in frameworks like React and Redux. Immutable data structures ensure that the state is never modified directly; instead, any updates result in a new copy of the state with the necessary changes applied.\n\nUsing immutable data structures helps prevent unintended side effects and makes it easier to track changes in the state. This approach is especially beneficial in debugging, as it allows developers to easily compare previous and current states, making it easier to identify where changes occurred.\n\nIn React, immutability is often enforced by using methods like or the spread operator to create new copies of objects or arrays. Redux also encourages immutability by design, as it requires that reducers return new state objects rather than modifying the existing state.\n\nVue.js and Angular also support immutable data patterns, though they are less strictly enforced. Developers can use similar techniques to ensure that their state remains immutable, improving the reliability and maintainability of the application.\n\nOptimizing state updates is crucial for maintaining a fast and responsive application. This involves minimizing the number of state changes that trigger re-renders or updates to the user interface. In frameworks like React, unnecessary re-renders can be avoided by using techniques such as , , or to control when a component should update.\n\nIn Vue.js, the reactivity system automatically optimizes updates, but developers can further enhance performance by using the directive to render elements only once or by carefully managing component lifecycles.\n\nAngular’s change detection mechanism also provides tools for optimizing performance, such as the change detection strategy, which limits updates to components only when their inputs change.\n\nBy carefully managing when and how the state is updated, developers can ensure that their applications remain performant, even as the complexity of the state increases.\n\nRedux is one of the most popular libraries for state management in React applications. It provides a centralized store where all the state of the application is kept, ensuring consistency and predictability across different components.\n\nRedux operates on three core principles: having a single source of truth (the store), state being read-only, and changes being made using pure functions called reducers.\n\nOne of the key benefits of Redux is that it makes the state predictable. Because all state changes are funneled through reducers, which are pure functions, it’s easy to understand how the state is updated and to debug any issues that arise.\n\nAdditionally, Redux’s middleware, like Redux Thunk or Redux Saga, allows developers to handle asynchronous operations, such as API calls, in a controlled and predictable manner.\n\nWhile Redux is powerful, it also comes with some complexity. Managing large applications with Redux can involve a significant amount of boilerplate code, which is why it’s important to weigh the benefits against the overhead, particularly for smaller projects.\n\nVuex is the official state management library for Vue.js and is heavily inspired by the concepts of Redux. Like Redux, Vuex provides a centralized store for all the components in an application, allowing them to share and manage state efficiently.\n\nVuex also integrates seamlessly with Vue’s reactivity system, making it easy to keep the user interface in sync with the state.\n\nVuex is structured around several key concepts, including state, getters, mutations, and actions. State refers to the data itself, while getters are computed properties that allow you to derive data from the state.\n\nMutations are the only way to change the state, ensuring that all changes are trackable and predictable. Actions, on the other hand, handle asynchronous operations and commit mutations when the operation is complete.\n\nVuex’s tight integration with Vue.js makes it a natural choice for managing state in larger Vue applications, particularly when multiple components need to share and update state.\n\nNgRx is a powerful state management library for Angular that is based on Redux’s principles. It provides a reactive state management solution using Angular’s services and RxJS, which allows developers to handle state changes as streams of actions and data.\n\nNgRx offers a highly structured approach to managing state, making it easier to maintain large-scale applications.\n\nOne of the key features of NgRx is its use of selectors, which allow developers to efficiently retrieve slices of the state from the store. NgRx also supports effects, which handle side effects like API calls in a declarative manner, keeping the business logic separate from the state management logic.\n\nNgRx’s integration with Angular’s dependency injection and service architecture makes it a robust choice for state management in complex Angular applications.\n\nHowever, like Redux, it can introduce additional complexity, so it’s important to consider whether the benefits justify the overhead in your specific use case.\n\nRecoil is a relatively new state management library for React that offers a more flexible and modern approach compared to Redux. It was developed by Facebook to address some of the limitations of Redux, particularly around boilerplate code and performance.\n\nRecoil allows you to manage both local and global state in a way that feels more natural in the React ecosystem.\n\nOne of Recoil’s standout features is its atom and selector concepts. Atoms are units of state that can be shared across components, while selectors are derived state that can be computed from one or more atoms.\n\nThis allows for fine-grained control over state and makes it easier to optimize performance by only re-rendering components that depend on specific pieces of state.\n\nRecoil’s simplicity and flexibility make it an attractive alternative to Redux, particularly for developers looking to reduce boilerplate code while maintaining a powerful state management solution.\n\nMobX is another popular state management library that focuses on simplicity and reactivity. It’s less opinionated than Redux or Vuex, which gives developers more freedom to structure their state management as they see fit.\n\nMobX uses observable data, which automatically tracks changes and updates the user interface accordingly.\n\nOne of MobX’s key advantages is its ease of use. It requires less boilerplate code compared to Redux or Vuex, and its reactivity system is highly intuitive, making it easier to manage complex state with minimal effort.\n\nMobX can be used with both React and Vue.js, providing a versatile solution for developers working in either ecosystem.\n\nMobX is particularly well-suited for applications where you need to manage highly dynamic state with frequent updates, as its reactivity system ensures that the UI stays in sync with the state without requiring explicit management of state changes.\n\nZustand is a lightweight state management library for React that provides a minimalistic API while remaining powerful enough to handle complex state management needs. Unlike Redux, Zustand doesn’t require actions or reducers, which significantly reduces the amount of boilerplate code required.\n\nZustand’s key features include simple and intuitive hooks-based API, which allows you to create and consume state with just a few lines of code. It also supports middleware for handling side effects and provides excellent performance by minimizing unnecessary re-renders.\n\nZustand is a great choice for developers who want a simple and effective state management solution without the complexity of Redux or other more heavyweight libraries. It’s particularly well-suited for small to medium-sized projects where ease of use and performance are top priorities.\n\nIn real-time applications, such as chat apps or live updates on a dashboard, managing state becomes even more critical. Real-time data introduces additional complexity because the state must be updated continuously and reflect changes almost instantly.\n\nHandling this type of data requires a strategy that ensures the application remains responsive and that state updates are efficiently managed.\n\nWebSockets, for example, are often used in real-time applications to maintain an open connection between the client and server, allowing for instantaneous data updates.\n\nWhen integrating WebSockets with a state management library, it’s essential to manage incoming data in a way that doesn’t overwhelm the application or lead to unnecessary re-renders.\n\nIn a React application using Redux, for example, you might use middleware to listen for WebSocket messages and dispatch actions to update the state accordingly.\n\nIn Vue.js, Vuex actions can handle WebSocket messages and commit mutations to update the state. Angular’s RxJS library is particularly well-suited for managing real-time data streams, as it allows developers to handle asynchronous data flows with ease.\n\nTo ensure that your application remains performant when dealing with real-time data, it’s crucial to optimize how state updates are handled. One strategy is to batch updates together whenever possible, reducing the number of re-renders and improving overall performance.\n\nFor instance, rather than updating the state every time a new message is received in a chat application, you might group messages together and update the state in larger, less frequent batches.\n\nAnother approach is to use selectors or computed properties to only re-render the parts of the UI that are directly affected by the new data. This ensures that even in a high-frequency data environment, only the necessary components are updated, keeping the user experience smooth and responsive.\n\nIn some applications, especially those that operate in real-time, persisting the state across sessions is important. State persistence ensures that users can return to the application and continue where they left off, even if they close their browser or navigate away.\n\nState persistence can be handled in several ways, including using local storage, session storage, or IndexedDB. When implementing state persistence, it’s important to consider what parts of the state should be persisted and how often the state should be saved.\n\nFor example, in an e-commerce application, you might persist the shopping cart state, while in a chat application, you might persist user settings or preferences.\n\nIn Redux, state persistence is often managed using middleware like , which automatically saves the state to local storage and rehydrates it when the application is reloaded.\n\nVuex also offers plugins for state persistence, while Angular services can be configured to handle saving and retrieving state from persistent storage.\n\nIn real-time applications where multiple clients are interacting with the same data, ensuring consistency across all clients can be a challenge. For example, in a collaborative editing tool, multiple users might be editing the same document simultaneously.\n\nManaging the state in such a scenario requires careful synchronization between clients to prevent conflicts and ensure that all users see the same updates.\n\nOne approach is to implement optimistic updates, where the state is updated immediately on the client side, with the assumption that the server will accept the change.\n\nIf the server rejects the update due to a conflict, the state can be rolled back or adjusted accordingly. This technique keeps the application feeling responsive, even in the face of network latency or server delays.\n\nAnother approach is to use a centralized server to manage the state and broadcast updates to all clients. This ensures that all clients are synchronized and receive the same data at the same time.\n\nFrameworks like Firebase provide real-time databases that handle much of the synchronization and state management for you, making it easier to build collaborative applications.\n\nEffective debugging is essential for managing state in client-side rendering, especially in complex applications with many components and interactions. Understanding how state changes over time and what triggers those changes can help identify and fix bugs quickly.\n\nFor React developers using Redux, the Redux DevTools extension is an invaluable tool for debugging state changes. It allows you to inspect the state at any point in time, track actions, and even “time travel” to previous states to see how the application behaved.\n\nThis can be particularly useful for identifying bugs that occur due to unexpected state changes or interactions between components.\n\nVue.js developers can use Vue DevTools, which provides similar functionality for inspecting the Vuex store, tracking mutations and actions, and understanding how the state changes in response to user interactions.\n\nAngular’s Augury is another powerful tool for debugging state management, allowing you to inspect the structure of your Angular application and understand how data flows through components and services.\n\nTesting is a critical part of any state management strategy. Ensuring that your state management logic works as expected, especially when dealing with complex interactions or asynchronous data, is essential for maintaining the reliability of your application.\n\nUnit tests can be used to verify the behavior of individual reducers, actions, and selectors in Redux. By isolating each part of your state management logic, you can ensure that it behaves correctly under various conditions, such as when receiving different types of data or handling errors.\n\nIn Vue.js, you can test Vuex mutations and actions using libraries like Vue Test Utils and Jest. By simulating different state scenarios, you can ensure that your state management logic handles edge cases correctly and that the state is updated as expected.\n\nAngular’s testing framework, combined with Jasmine and Karma, allows you to test services and components that manage state. Testing the state logic in isolation, as well as in the context of the application, helps ensure that your state management approach is robust and resilient.\n\nAs your application grows, your state management strategy must scale accordingly. This involves not only managing more data but also ensuring that your state management logic remains maintainable and efficient.\n\nOne way to ensure scalability is to modularize your state management logic. For example, in Redux, you can split the store into smaller, feature-specific slices, each with its own set of reducers and actions.\n\nThis makes it easier to manage and test the state for individual features, while still allowing the overall state to be managed consistently.\n\nIn Vuex, you can use modules to organize the state management logic into separate, reusable units. Each module can manage its own state, mutations, actions, and getters, making it easier to maintain and scale the state as the application grows.\n\nAngular’s service-oriented architecture naturally supports scalability by allowing you to create separate services for different parts of the application. By keeping the state management logic within these services, you can ensure that the state remains organized and manageable, even as the application becomes more complex.\n\nEffective state management is the backbone of any successful client-side rendered application. As applications grow in complexity and scale, managing state becomes increasingly challenging, but also more critical to the overall performance and user experience. By understanding the different approaches to state management—whether through local or global strategies, handling real-time data, or using tools like Redux, Vuex, or NgRx—developers can ensure their applications remain responsive, maintainable, and scalable.\n\nThe key lies in choosing the right tools and techniques for your specific needs, keeping the state minimal and focused, and continuously refining your approach as the application evolves. With the right strategy in place, you can confidently build applications that not only meet users’ expectations but also stand the test of time as they grow and evolve.\n• How to Use HSTS for Enhanced Website Security\n• The Role of VPNs in Enhancing Web Security\n• How to Protect Sensitive Data with Data Masking"

        "document": "Let me explain the goal of my code first. I have a react component called \"Tile\" containing a sub-component called \"TileMenu\" which shows up when I make a right click on my Tile, calling the function \"openMenu\". I wanted to have two ways of closing it:\n\nBut, I also wanted it to stay in place if the mouse was over it. So I needed a function to cancel the timer, which I called \"keepMenuOpened\". If I moved my mouse away, openMenu() was called again to relaunch the timer.\n\nHere is my code:\n\nAt first, it seemed to work perfectly. But I noticed that when I opened, then closed manually, and finally opened my TileMenu again, the delay it took to close a second time (this time alone) was calculated from the first time I opened it.\n\nI used console.log() to see what was happening under the hood and it seemed to be caused by the asynchronous update of states in React (Indeed, at the first attempt, I get and in the console. When I move my mouse over the TileMenu and then leave it, I get for example , then and then !) If I understand well my specific case, React uses the previous state in openMenu and closeMenu but the current state in keepMenuOpened.\n\nIn fact, this is not my first attempt and before using a react state, \"timeoutID\" was a simple variable. But this time, it was inaccessible inside keepMenuOpened (it logged in the console) even if declared in Tile() scope and accessible in openMenu and closeMenu. I think it's because closeMenu is called from openMenu. I found on the net it was called a closure but I didn't figure out exactly how it worked with React.\n\nAnd now I haven't figured out how to solve my specific problem. I found that I could use useEffect() to access my updated states but it doesn't work in my case where I need to declare my functions inside Tile() to use them as event handlers. I wonder if my code is designed correctly."
