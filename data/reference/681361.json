Every file providing there is accepted by the devBukkit staff\n• I can upload a new version with bug fixes where you don't have to download it, the plugin can do it for you automatically.\n• The updater only runs on plugin startup, and then as a seperate thread, so it doesn't really affect your startup time.\n• Every file there equals the files on this page.\n\nAs you can see on file list there are selected three versions. These version numbers are for the Minecraft versions. Lowest test version, mid version and the highest tested version. That means that you should always use the latest version of ScoreboardStats although you use an old Minecraft version. It's very hard to use all versions at once, so please use the newest version of ScoreboardStats."
