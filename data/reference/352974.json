        "document": "Procedural level generation is a technique to create game scenes on the fly following specific criteria completely at random. In principle that means that with each new game our protagonists will potentially face different landscapes on their journey. As developers, by introducing this simple method we can not only enhance the gameplay experience but also increase the re-playability value to the players. As designers we have a total control over the look & feel of the procedural levels. The game will always stay fresh due to random placement of platforms, enemies and objects in the map whenever we start it. In this article we’ll look into how we can implement procedural level generator for a 2D platformer in Unity.\n• Developing a procedural map generator\n• First version of the procedural map generator\n• Second version of the procedural map generator\n• Polishing the path area\n• Shifting the position of the Hilbert’s Curve\n\nLet’s step back for a minute and think about how we create our game worlds. It usually requires a designer to carefully place individual elements by hand in the scene. The approach works when we want our levels to strictly fit into the narrative of the game. By doing so we can guide our player through critical events that shall allow further progression. However, sometimes we want to give players novel experience each time a new game starts. It can be achieved by introducing the random element to the way we shift the appearance and placement of objects in a 2D map. Indeed, there are many examples of games out there utilizing such mechanism of procedural generation of levels.\n\nOne of the classic examples is Diablo series hack-and-slash action RPGs. The protagonist endeavors through vast dark areas in order to find and defeat the title demon. In this isometric perspective game levels are comprised of tiles. They are lied out according to a set of predefined rules. In the original game players traveled to deepest floors of the dungeon located in the town of Tristram. Each floor has various corridors, rooms, doors, stairs, items, monsters and many more objects that players have to face. They are procedurally rendered before the adventure begins. The generator allows to maintain a certain degree of control over their placement. There is a fantastic article by Boris the Brave in which he explains how this algorithm works in more detail.\n\nIn Terraria the whole world is made out of 2D sprites according to the rules enforced by the generator. Since we have access to source code of the game we can examine the level development mechanism. The generator uses a lot of conditional and iteration statements that formulate an enormous rule-set for Cellular Automata (CA) to lay out the map. This is where we got to a point where we need to emphasize one important aspect of procedural generators.\n\nThe pure random distribution of tiles will almost never look visually appealing to the eye. The reason is that as humans we are used to discovering patterns in our surroundings. More crucially, we would like to achieve a cohesive and organically structured playable levels. We want to see naturally occurring hierarchical clusters of things that do not look out of place – just like in nature. The virtual space we populate also needs to maintain proper spacing between a variety of elements. Otherwise we risk players getting helplessly stuck at certain parts of the level, without any way of further progression.\n\nIn a very popular game Minecraft, in which worlds are made out of fixed sized cubes, it would be odd to suddenly see a cactus in an area that’s not a desert or at least a dry land. Of course, since the game offers high level of customization and building capabilities to the player it is possible to plant them in other areas as well during gameplay. However, that’s a topic for another time.\n\nThe point is, if we want our procedurally generated maps to look natural we need to make our algorithm adhere to certain rules. There are few commonly known guidelines for developing a good map generator and distributor of game objects:\n• Barnacling rule states that big objects should usually be surrounded by objects with their sizes gradually descending. For example, if you have a huge mountain in your game it should be surrounded by medium hills and finally smaller rocks.\n• Footing rule states that whenever two objects intersect, the algorithm needs to be aware of this intersection. For instance, if you plant a tree in your terrain, make sure its roots remain invisible to the player. Furthermore, you may wish to make it more prominent and place some dirt bumps around it.\n• Greebling rule refers to gluing chunks of textured objects together to create either their bigger versions or completely new ones. The term was coined by George Lucas during one of his trips to Tunisia while filming Star Wars. At the time, he was asked by customs to label his diorama props used to make some of the iconic scenes. He simply called them “greebles” because they were things that could not be properly categorized or defined. However, when put together they could represent futuristic-looking objects (i.e. the Millenium Falcon spacecraft or Death Star station).\n• Critical path rule states that regardless of the generated map size or objects placements, there must exist a clear and well-defined path to move forward in the game. In practice, the path can be hidden and camouflaged in some way to encourage world exploration. However, it must be present for the player to discover.\n\nBy sticking to above basic rules we can lay down the foundation of a procedural generator. It can make the game not only fun to play but also feel more intuitive to the player. In the end of the day, it is up to us, developers how far we want to go with it.\n\nLet’s just remember that the most difficult part of procedural generators is their design. In other words it is something that is hard to get “right”. I’ll make an attempt at developing a simple algorithm with a sole task of procedurally generating game content on the fly! Let’s begin!"

        "document": "In this tutorial series, we are going to dive into Unity procedural generation for creating levels. For the first part of the tutorial, we are going to use pseudorandom noise to generate height maps and choose terrain types according to the height in each part of our level. In the next tutorials, we are going to assign biomes for each part of the level and in the end, we are going to generate a level map object that can still be manually edited according to the game needs.\n\nThis tutorial series takes inspiration from, and expands on techniques presented by Sebastian Lague, Holistic3D and this GDC talk on procedural generation in No Man’s Sky.\n\nLooking for Unity procedural generation on 2D maps instead? Check out this article here instead!\n\nIn order to follow this tutorial, you are expected to be familiar with the following concepts:\n• Basic Unity concepts, such as importing assets, creating prefabs and adding components\n\nIf you’ve never touched Unity before, Zenva’s Unity Game Development Mini-Degree is a comprehensive resource that can play a pivotal role. This Mini-Degree includes in-depth course material on how to optimize and procedurally generate terrain, among other essential game development aspects, proving to be a valuable tool in your Unity toolkit. By understanding Unity’s vast capabilities explored in this Mini-Degree, you can also create compelling games and applications, just like top game developers around the world.\n\nYou can download the tutorial source code files here .\n\nBefore starting to read the tutorial, create a new Unity project. If you’re new to Unity, we recommend checking out some beginner-friendly Unity courses first.\n\nIn order to construct levels with Unity procedural generation, we are going to use noise functions in our code. A noise function is basically a function that generates pseudorandom values based on some input arguments. By pseudorandom it means the values look random, despite being algorithmically generated. In practice, you can see this noise as a variable, which can be used as the height, temperature or moisture values of a level region. In our case, we are going to use it as the height of different coordinates of our level.\n\nThere are different noise functions, but we are going to use a specially popular one called Perlin Noise. You don’t need to fully understand Perlin Noise, since Unity provides an implemention it and makes it easy for our purposes of Unity procedural generation. What I’m going to explain in this tutorial is how you can use it in your code.\n\nSo, let’s start by creating a script we are going to generate a noise map. First, create a new script called NoiseMapGeneration. This script will have a function called GenerateNoiseMap, which will receive as parameters the map height, map width and a scale. Then, it will generate a matrix representing a noise map, with the noise in each coordinate of the level.\n\nFor each coordinate, we generate the noise vaue using the Mathf.PerlinNoise function. This function receives two parameters and generate a value between 0 and 1, representing the noise. Notice that we are going to use the x and z axes to access the level coordinates, while the y axis will be used to change the height of our level in a given coordinate. So, the parameters for the PerlinNoise function will be the x and z indices divided by the level scale. In practice, the level scale parameter acts as a zoom parameter in the level. In the end, it returns the noise map.\n\nNow we need some way to visualize this noise map. What we are going to do is creating a Plane GameObject to represent a tile in our level. Then, we can show the generated noise values by painting the tile vertices according to their corresponding noise values. Again, this noise can represent anything you want, such as height, temperature, moisture, etc. In our case, it will represent the height of that vertex.\n\nThis said, if you truly want to master Unity procedural generation, we encourage you to play around with different scenarios.\n\nNext for our Unity procedural generation, we’ll create a tile that takes on our noise.\n\nLet’s start by creating a new Plane (3D Object -> Plane) object called Level Tile. This will create the object below, already with a Mesh Renderer, which we are going to use to show the noise map.\n\nBefore showing the noise map in the tile, it is important that you understand how a Plane mesh looks like. The figure below shows the a Plane created in Unity along with its Mesh. Notice that the mesh vertices are not only the four Plane vertices. Instead, the Mesh contains several intermediate vertices that are connected inside the Plane. Basically, what we are going to do is using each one of those vertices as a coordinate for our noise map later. This way, we can assign a color to each vertex (which will be a height later) according to each generated noise value.\n\nThis is something important to understand for procedural generation, as the density of your vertices can vastly affect how smooth your terrain transitions are.\n\nNow, we create the following Script called TileGeneration. This script will be responsible for generating a noise map for the tile and then assigning a texture to it according to the noise map (a big portion of our Unity procedural generation). As this noise map will be used to assign heights to each vertex, from now on I’m going to call it a height map.\n\nFirst of all, notice that the script has the following attributes:\n• noiseMapGeneration: the script which will be used to generate the height map\n• tileRenderer: the mesh renderer, used to show the height map\n• meshFilter: the mesh filter component, used to access the mesh vertices\n• meshCollider: the mesh collider component, used to handle collisions with the tile\n• levelScale: the scale of the height map\n\nBasically, in the Start method it will call the GenerateTile method, which will do all this stuff. The first thing it does is calculate the depth and width of the height map. Since we are using a square plane, the number of vertices should be a perfect square (in our case, the default Unity Plane has 121 vertices). So, if we take the square root of the number of vertices, we will get the map depth and width, which will be 11. Then, it calls the GenerateNoiseMap method with this depth and width, as well as the levelScale.\n\ncreate a new texture and set its pixel\n\nAfter generating the height map, the script will call the BuildTexture method, which will create the Texture2D for this tile. Then, we assign this texture to the tile material.\n\nThe BuildTexture method will create a Color array, which will be used to create the Texture2D. Then, for each coordinate of the height map, it will choose a shade of grey based on the height value. We can do this by using the Color.Lerp function. This function receives as parameters two colors (in our case black and white) and a float value between 0 and 1 (in our case the noise value).\n\nThen, it chooses a color between the two ones selected according to the float value. Basically, the lower the height, the darker will be the color. In the end, it creates a Texture2D using this Color array and returns it.\n\nNow that the TileGeneration script is complete for our Unity procedural generation, we add both our scripts to the Level Tile object.\n\nAnd then, we can try playing our game to visualize the height map. The image below shows a height map generated using a scale of 3. Hint: it is easier to visualize the tile if you switch back to the Scene view after starting the game. This way you can easily move the camera to see tile by different angles.\n\nOur next step is to assign terrain types (such as water, grass, rock, mountain) to different height values for our Unity procedural generation to be what we want it to be. Also, each terrain type will have a color associated with it, so that we can add colors to our Level Tile.\n\nFirst, we need to create a TerrainType class in the TileGeneration Script. Each terrain type will have a name, height and color. Also, we need to add the [System.Serializable] tag before the class declaration. This will allow us to set the TerrainType attributes in the editor later. Finally, we are going to add another attribute to the TileGeneration Script, which will be an Array of TerrainTypes. Those will be the available terrain types for our level.\n\nThen, we can set the terrain types for the Level Tile in the editor. Those are the terrain types I’m going to use. You can set them as you prefer, but it is important that the terrain types are in a ascending order of height values, as this will be necessary soon.\n\nNow let’s change the TileGeneration script to use those terrain types to assign colors to the tile. Basically we are going to change the BuildTexture method to, instead of picking a shade of grey for the color, we are going to choose a terrain according to the noise value (using a ChooseTerrainType method). Then we assign the terrain type color to that level tile coordinate.\n\nThe ChooseTerrainType method will simply iterate through the terrainTypes array and return the first terrain type whose height is greater than the height value (that’s is why it is important that the terrain types are in ascending order of height).\n\nNow we can try playing the game again to see our tile with colors. You will notice that the tile looks a little blurred, but don’t worry about that now. It will look better once we have multiple tiles in our Unity procedural generation level.\n\nLost and need more Unity foundations first? The Unity Game Development Mini-Degree by Zenva equips you with comprehensive skills in Unity, including procedural generation to create dynamic environments, making it your one-stop solution to creating captivating cross-platform games.\n\nWe have assigned terrain types to the tile coordinates. However, it is still a plane, even in the mountain regions. What we are going to do now is using the height map to assign different heights to the tile vertices – which is quite common for Unity procedural generation. We can do that by changing the y coordinate of the vertices.\n\nIn order to do so, we are going to create a new method in the TileGeneration Script called UpdateMeshVertices. This method will be responsible for changing the Plane Mesh vertices according to the height map, and it will be called in the end of the GenerateTile method. Basically, it will iterate through all the tile coordinates and change the corresponding vertex y coordinate to be the noise value multiplied by a heightMultiplier. By changing the heightMultiplier we can change how the level looks like.\n\nIn the end, it updates the vertices array in the Mesh and call the RecalculateBounds and RecalculateNormals methods. Those methods must be called every time you change vertices in the mesh. We also need to update the Mesh in the MeshCollider.\n\nThen, we can assign a heightMultiplier to the Level Tile and try running the game. The figure below shows a tile using a heightMultiplier of 3. We can see the mountains on it, but there is still a problem. We are applying heights even for water regions, which makes them look weird, since they should be plane. That’s what we are going to fix now.\n\n(Keep in mind, this is just how we want our Unity procedural generation to work – there’s no rule that says you can’t apply the height map to water regions).\n\nWhat we are going to do is create a custom function that receives input height values from our height map and returns corrected height values. This function should return a 0 value for all height values below 0.4, so that water regions are plane. We can do that by adding another attribute in the TileGeneration Script which is an AnimationCurve. Then, when assiging the y coordinate value of each vertex, we evaluate the height value in this function, before multiplying it by the heightMultiplier.\n\nNow let’s create this heightCurve. We can do this in the Editor, by selecting it in the Level Tile object. The curve should look similar to the one below. You can create a curve like this by selecting the third one in the menu, then adding a Key (right-click -> Add Key) in the 0.4 point and then dragging it to 0. You will also need to change the borders of the Key so that it is plane up to 0.4.\n\nFinally, if you try playing the game it should show the level with plane water areas, which should look much better (again, for how we want our Unity procedural generation to work for water).\n\nThe last thing we are going to do in this Unity procedural generation tutorial is add multiple tiles to build a whole level. Each level tile will generate its own height values and the neighbor tiles should have continuous heights. So, the first thing we are going to do is make sure that Level Tiles will have the same height values in their borders.\n\nWe can do that by making sure that we are calling the PerlinNoise function with the same argument values for the border pixels. In order to do so, we are going to add offset parameters in the GenerateNoiseMap function. Those offsets are added to the x and z indices when calculating the x and z samples. Later, those offsets will correspond to the Level Tile position, so that the height is continuous along the tiles.\n\nThen, we need to add those offset parameters when calling GenerateNoiseMap in the TileGeneration Script. The value of those parameters will be the opposite of the x and z coordinates of the Level Tile.\n\nBefore creating the whole Unity procedural generation level with several tiles, let’s create just two of them and put them side by side to check if the heights are continuous on the borders. For example, I created the two tiles below.\n\nThen, when running the game, they should look like a single level with two tiles.\n\nWhat we are going to do now is generalizing this to a level with any number of tiles. First, save the Level Tile object as a prefab, so that we can instantiate copies of it later. Then, let’s create a new Script called LevelGeneration. This script will be responsible for creating multiple Level Tiles. It will have the following attributes:\n• mapWidthInTiles: number of tiles in the x axis\n• mapDepthInTiles: number of tiles in the z axis\n• tilePrefab: Level Tile prefab, used to instantiate the tiles\n\nThen, the GenerateLevel method will create the Level Tiles by iterating through all the tile coordinates. For each tile, it calculates its position based on the tile coordinate and then instantiate a copy of it from the Level Tile prefab. In the end, this GenerateLevel method is called inside the Start method.\n\nNow, remove the Level Tiles from your Unity procedural generation scene and add a single Level object, with some tiles in the x and z axis. The figure below shows an example of a Level with 10 tiles in each axis. You may also want to change the Level Scale and Height Multiplier for the Level Tiles to make the level look better. In the figure below I used a Level Scale of 10 and a Height Multiplier of 5. However, you can still see some repeating patterns in the level, as well as some weird-shaped regions.\n\nSo, our last step in this Unity procedural generation tutorial will be to polish a little bit the Noise Map generation to make the level look more natural.\n\nAs you might notice with our current Unity procedural generation level is that the height changes don’t look natural.\n\nWhat we are going to do in order to polish the noise map generation is add more noise waves. Basically, when you call Mathf.PerlinNoise, you’re sampling points from a noise wave. So, if we change this wave frequency and amplitude we change the noise result. Another way of changing the noise values is adding a random seed in the samples. By creating multiple waves with different frequencies and amplitudes, we can generate more interesting noise, which will lead to levels that look more natural. The different seed values, by their turn, allows us to remove the repetitions in the level.\n\nSo, first, let’s create a Wave class inside the NoiseMapGeneration Script. Like the TerainType, the Wave will be a Serializable class with a few attributes. The attributes we are going to use are the seed, frequency and amplitude of the wave, as discussed earlier.\n\nThen, we change the GenerateNoiseMap method to receive an Array of Waves as a parameter. Then, instead of calling Math.PerlinNoise a single time, we call it once for each Wave, using the wave seed, frequency, and amplitude. Notice that the frequency is multiplied by the sample value, while the amplitude is multiplied by the noise result. In the end, we need to divide the noise by the sum of amplitudes, so that its result will remain between 0 and 1.\n\nNow, we need to add an Array of Waves as a new attribute of the TileGeneration Script, so that we can send it to the GenerateNoiseMap method.\n\nFinally, we add some Wave values in the Level Tile prefab and then we can play the game again to see the new level. The figure below shows the values I’m using in this tutorial to generate the level in the righthand figure. Notice that I changed the Level Scale and Height Multiplier again, to make the level look better. You may have to try different values until you find the one that looks better to you and for what you want your Unity procedural generation to look like.\n\nAnd this concludes this Unity procedural generation tutorial! In the next one, we are going to generate temperatures and moisture values for our level, so that we can select biomes for different level areas.\n\nAs you delve deeper into the world of Unity procedural generation, though, taking Zenva’s Unity Game Development Mini-Degree can provide you with a highly comprehensive learning platform.

        "document": "Procedural Generation, also known as Procedural Content Generation (PCG), is the creation of data using an algorithm, as opposed to manually creating the data. This data is generated during runtime.\n\nImagine you’re walking in a meadow with mountains surrounding you, birds chirping, elk grazing on the grass nearby, and wildflowers all around your feet. You feel alive and say to yourself, “Wow… This is beautiful!” As you arrive back home from this amazing experience, you remember your game development skills that you’ve been learning. After quickly booting up your PC, you open your favorite game engine and try to manually recreate this extraordinary mountain meadow experience. You fail miserably after realizing the amount of work involved in manually creating a landscape. Just as all seems lost, the term procedural generation comes into your head. After conducting enough research, you become an expert in procedural generation and soon generate your beautiful mountain landscape using an algorithmic approach rather than manual creation. Success!\n\nNow, the scenario I gave above is a bit extreme. Landscapes or environments can very well be created through a manual process without even using procedural generation. Likely with enough experience, you could manually create a similar setup to the mountain landscape I explained in my scenario, instead of using procedural generation. However, the point I was trying to get across was that procedural generation is often desired in the generation of terrain or landscapes to reduce the amount of manual labor. Moreover, if you intended to create a very detailed landscape that appeared to be infinite in size, this would be close to impossible to create manually. This is where procedural generation can be used to generate this type of landscape.\n\nThe reason I chose landscape generation for my scenario is because I’m very passionate about it. Apparently a lot of other people are too because this seems to be one of the most common topics for PCG when searching the web. Landscape generation is not the only form of PCG however. In fact, there are many forms ranging from generating animations to music and more!\n\nAh yes, our favorite topic. History! It seems that people either love it or hate it. I’ll keep this section relatively short, but I believe it’s always important to know the history of something that you’re learning.\n\nWhile its difficult to find on the web which game was the first to use PCG, two of the most notable games are Rogue(1980) and Elite(1984). Rogue started a new genre of video games called rogue-like games. These featured procedurally generated levels where the player navigates a labyrinth type environment (referred to as a dungeon). Although some of these games predate Rogue, such as Beneath Apple Manor(1978), Rogue is considered the ancestor of all rogue-like games.\n\nThe early history of games had memory limitations which is one of the driving factors of their decision to use procedural generation so they could compress the data and decrease their file sizes.\n\nNowadays, computers are more advanced and don’t have as many memory or hardware restrictions. Even still, PCG is commonly used as a way for data compression. Modern uses of PCG often include creating terrain, levels, storylines, or other data that is unique for each playthrough.\n\nProcedural generation is generally used for increasing the replay value, data compression, reusing data, and for greater scalability in games.\n\nWithin game development there are many areas where procedural generation can be used. I’ve listed a few of these areas below, and although these are not all of them, they seem to be the most common ones used in games.\n\nOften 2D games will use algorithms to generate levels in their games. This approach is seen in rogue-like games.\n\nMany open world games procedural generate their landscape in some way. No Man’s Sky, a game developed by Hello Games, used procedural generation to create an entire galaxy of planets, each containing their own atmosphere and wildlife.\n\nAnimation, such as character animation, is another use of procedural generation. PCG may help the animation appear more unique and flow smoothly.\n\nOften to create a unique playthrough, games will procedurally generate the dialogue. Moreover, the decisions the player makes in the game may affect the storyline and allow the storyline to generate its own content based on how the character responds to a certain event.\n\nInstantiating objects is one of the most common uses of PCG in games. Often this is referred to as spawning. The objects that are spawned may be enemies, animals, trees, loot, particle systems, and more!\n\nOften quest-based games will use an algorithm to create a loot system. This algorithm may generate loot based on the player’s current level. If the player has a high rank, the generated loot will likely be more rare as opposed to that of a low ranked player."

        "document": "Procedural generation, the art of creating content algorithmically rather than manually, has become a cornerstone in game development, offering limitless possibilities for generating diverse and dynamic environments. In Unity, mastering procedural generation opens up a world of opportunities for developers to create expansive worlds, intricate landscapes, and immersive experiences. In this article, we’ll delve into some of the essential tools and techniques for learning and implementing procedural generation in Unity.\n\nBefore diving into the tools and techniques, it’s crucial to grasp the fundamental concepts of procedural generation. At its core, procedural generation involves using algorithms to generate content dynamically during runtime, rather than relying solely on pre-designed assets. This approach enables developers to create vast, varied, and often unpredictable game worlds, enhancing replayability and scalability.\n• Procedural Toolkit: A powerful Unity asset designed specifically for procedural generation, Procedural Toolkit provides a comprehensive set of tools and utilities for creating procedural content. From generating terrain to building cities, dungeons, or even entire planets, Procedural Toolkit offers a versatile solution for developers looking to incorporate procedural generation into their projects.\n• Habrador Computational Geometry: Developed by Habrador, this library offers a range of computational geometry algorithms that can be invaluable for procedural generation tasks. Whether you need to generate meshes, perform geometric operations, or implement procedural algorithms, Habrador Computational Geometry provides a wealth of functionality to streamline your development process.\n• G3Sharp: Another excellent library for computational geometry in Unity, G3Sharp offers a variety of geometric algorithms and data structures essential for procedural generation tasks. With support for operations like triangulation, mesh generation, and spatial partitioning, G3Sharp provides developers with the tools they need to create complex procedural content efficiently.\n• CGALDotNetUnity: is a powerful library that bridges the computational geometry capabilities of CGAL (Computational Geometry Algorithms Library) with the Unity game engine.
