        "document": "You’re not just a small business owner; you’re also the chief cook, operating engineer, and marketing genius behind the small business you run.\n\nYour time and energy are precious commodities. And while you’ve learned the basics of email marketing, it’s time to do it faster and easier while being more effective.\n\nNow you can do more in less time by implementing these email marketing best practices into your email marketing strategy.\n\nThe first “best practice” for a successful email marketing strategy is the platform you use.\n\nWhile email providers like Gmail or Outlook are cheap and easy at first, they’re not going to provide you with the tools you need to build and grow your business.\n\nA best-in-class email marketing platform will help you:\n• Stay compliant with both national and international anti-spam laws and regulations\n• Collect data that will help you optimize your efforts\n\nLaws and regulations for email marketing vary around the world. Each country has specifics on who you can and can’t email, what needs to be included in your email’s footer, rules for opt-outs, etc.\n\nA professional email marketing platform makes sure you stay in compliance — so you don’t have to worry about all that legal stuff.\n\nFor example, email marketing platforms ensure that every email includes the needed footer information and that you’re only emailing opted-in subscribers. In short, they’ve got your back now and in the future, even when new laws or changes come into play.\n\nAll you need to do is get permission from your subscribers and be honest in your emails.\n\nWe don’t know about you, but we like to look good. Especially in the inbox. When you use a professional email platform, looking good comes easy. Select a mobile-responsive template, customize it with your brand, and add your content. This part is simple and fun!\n\nA professional email marketing platform provides you with accurate and timely data on every email sent.\n\nYou’ll be able to see opens, clicks, bounces, opt-out information, and more. Not to mention, you’ll be able to glean information on subscribers’ interests in certain products or topics based on their actions or inactions.\n\nMaking it easy to identify areas for testing and improvement over time.\n\nGet it all with Constant Contact\n\nSafety, great looks, and the numbers you need. Sounds hard to get in one convenient package, but that’s what we provide at Constant Contact. Whether you’re new to digital marketing or a seasoned pro, we have the tools to make you look fantastic. Ready to take your marketing to the next level? Create an account and start using these tips immediately — not tomorrow or next week, but right now.\n\nWithout further ado, here are the best practices you need to know to drive your email marketing strategy toward success.\n\nKnow your risks before your email ends up in the spam folder\n\nBe sure your email will get delivered to your subscribers’ inboxes instead of landing in their spam folders.\n\nKnowing your spam risks and how to avoid them will help you maximize your email marketing efforts and limit any spam filtering.\n\nEmail is a permission-based marketing channel. In one way or another, people need to say “yes” to receiving emails from your business or organization — either verbally or by filling out a form.\n\nGetting permission from your subscribers is not just a recommendation; it is a requirement. And it will help you remain compliant with the anti-spam laws we mentioned earlier.\n\nMore importantly, you’ll be connecting with people who want to hear from you.\n\nOnline, bad reputations aren’t always about what you do or don’t do as an individual or a company.\n\nIf you use an unreliable email platform with less than a stellar deliverability rate or questionable anti-spam policies, your emails may be filtered out due to “guilt by association.”\n\nIn this case, you may not have done anything wrong, but others have.\n\nDon’t pay for others’ mistakes. Always use a reputable email service provider with a best-in-class deliverability rate.\n\nDifferent areas of the world have different rules and regulations.\n\nIf you’re sending marketing emails from a personal account, you could break the law without even knowing that you’re doing it.\n\nBe certain that you’re always in compliance without the worry. Use a professional email platform with a good reputation and deliverability rates to back it up.\n\nIt won’t matter if you’ve done everything technically right if you’re sending content about dogs to a cat owner.\n\nIf you’re sending content that doesn’t resonate with your audience or is different than what they expected when they signed up to receive your emails, then one of two things will likely happen:\n• Recipients will delete your emails so often that their email program automatically moves you into the spam folder or\n• They’ll be so annoyed that they’ll mark you as spam themselves rather than take the time to unsubscribe.\n\nTo avoid being moved to the spam folder, segment your email lists and tailor your messaging to fit each audience.\n\nWhile this was mentioned above, it’s worth mentioning again here.\n\nNot asking for permission before sending a marketing email to someone will not only land your email in a spam folder but will damage your reputation and that of your email provider. That’s why reputable email service providers will cancel your account if everyone on your email list doesn’t opt-in.\n\nTo avoid sullying reputations, and to keep your email account intact, always get permission before sending a marketing email.\n\nYes, it’s important to regularly clean out your email list in order to save yourself some time and money, but it’s also important for deliverability.\n\nIf you regularly send emails to derelict email addresses, it harms your deliverability rate and email programs like Google view low-deliverability rates as “unreliable sources.”\n\nAvoid becoming an unreliable source by regularly cleaning out your email list.\n\nTake spam prevention efforts one step further. Periodically review your email reports to identify any issues that may arise from one campaign to another. In particular, pay attention to your number sent versus delivered and reach out to your service provider for additional help if you need it.\n\nSeventy-five percent of subscribers admit they will delete an email if they can’t read it on a mobile device.\n\nWith so many people with devices in hand, design your emails with mobile in mind. Make sure someone can easily read it and take action.\n\nUse a mobile-responsive email template and your email will adapt and look great on any device.\n\nIn addition to using a mobile-responsive template, to be truly mobile-friendly:\n• Use an image that supports your message\n• Use a button for your call to action\n\nTo keep your email concise and inviting to read, Think: Picture — Paragraph — and Call to Action.\n\nWhen it comes to email marketing, branding is a must. Your brand is an essential element of your business or organization. It’s how people recognize you and what you do. When a recipient opens your email, they should recognize your brand at a glance. To make that happen, include your logo at the top, and use your brand colors throughout — at a minimum.\n\nTo fully brand your email template, implement your brand voice in your content, be consistent with your imagery style, logo placement, and brand colors and have a customized footer to bring it all together.\n\nYou only have three seconds to convince someone to open up your email.\n\nYour email’s subject line is only one line of text, but it can mean the difference between your email being opened and being trashed.\n\nA short, straightforward subject line that accurately reflects what’s in it for your subscriber can be very effective.\n\nHowever, depending on your brand voice, you may want to use personalization, emojis, numbers, or even include a sense of urgency — when applicable. In which case, use A/B testing to see what works best with your audience.\n\nPicture your email inbox. Do you see a “sound byte” of the message after the title? That’s preview text, or an “email preheader” if you want to be fancy. And yes, it works just like a movie preview. Someone reads the subject and is vaguely interested. Then, they see your fantastic preview and realize need to click! It’s one of the most satisfying email marketing best practices.\n\nDid you know people open less than 35% of their email messages? Your job as an email marketer or small business owner is to cut through the noise and earn those elusive clicks. Preview text gets you a step closer.\n\nEmail inboxes will create preview text if you don’t write it yourself. Most of the time, though, it pulls the first line from the email body — even if it’s that automatic “Can’t see the following image?”\n\nYou can design your own sneak peek with Constant Contact’s email preheader feature. Make it short, snappy, and can’t-miss so people feel compelled to read more.\n\nYour recipient’s inbox usually shows a bold subject line and plain-font preview text. The subject line gets their attention first. Then, the preview text steps in with a hint of what’s in store.\n\nPicture a recipient with four or five interesting subject lines about a big sale on your product type. Then ask yourself, what will make them choose us?\n\nFor example, imagine your subject line is:\n\nThe reader should know what they’d miss out on. Your preview text might read:\n\nSave up to 30% on select styles.\n\nSomeone won’t want to pass on saving up to a third of the price, so they’ll click before they forget.\n\nReading an email takes valuable time in someone’s day. Preview text works like an insider tip, telling people what’s inside so they know it’s worth opening.\n\nLook at the above example. The headline implies urgency, telling readers they’ll save money if they act now. It’s probably not the only email promising savings in the person’s inbox.\n\nThe preview text gives more detail, turning the message from a vague promise into a helpful tip. They know how much they’ll save and what’s on sale. That valuable information hints at more value inside.\n\nFun fact —for every five people who get your email, at least three will open it on a tablet or phone. Those mobile email platforms often show more of your preview text.\n\nThat means more space for you to entice readers. Remember that these readers are on the go and don’t have time to linger. Stay focused on value — what’s in it for them?\n\nMost email platforms put a strict limit on subject lines. At Constant Contact, we recommend no more than 40 characters (or four to seven words) to be safe.\n\nPreview text gives you more words to work with. Use it to add important details, emphasize a takeaway, or include a specific call to action.\n\nPlay your cards right, and your subject line plus preview text can be a sales message in its own right.\n\nSegment your lists for more targeted emails\n\nSegmentation is the process of dividing your contact list into smaller groups in order to send more relevant, personalized information and offers, as mentioned above.\n\nStart by thinking about what makes sense for you and your audience, such as smaller lists based on interests, demographics, or preferences on products or services.\n\nYou can even segment contacts automatically based on actions they take in your email. We offer a click segmentation feature that automatically adds contacts to a segmented list when someone clicks a link in your email.\n\nShow subscribers you care about their experience by using an email address that someone is monitoring. After viewing your email, subscribers may have questions and it should be easy to get answers. What’s easier than simply clicking the “reply” button at the top of their email?\n\nThis is an opportunity to engage with your subscribers when they’re ready. Use an email address that makes you look approachable and tells people that someone at your company will reply.\n\nInstead of using a “no-reply” sender address, use a reply email address of an employee or a customer service inbox such as “hello@yourdomain.com,” info@yourdomain.com” or “questions@yourdomain.com.”\n\nThink of your welcome emails as the host of a dinner party. It offers a warm smile, introduces your subscriber to the email list experience, and gives a taste of things to come.\n\nEven if subscribers have interacted with your brand before, they haven’t received your emails. A well-written welcome email shows them what to expect. It sets the tone for what kind of messages they’ll receive — and, more importantly, what kind of value is inside.\n\nImagine your customer typing their email address into your opt-in form. They see you have something valuable to offer and want to hear more.\n\nWelcome emails build on that spark of excitement. Someone signs up and immediately hears from you, thanking them for joining and giving a preview of the exciting material they’ll get in future messages.\n\nYou can easily set these up to send automatically when someone subscribes, so they hear from you within seconds of joining.\n\nPersonalization is a must in email marketing today. Surveys show that 71% of customers expect personalized experiences, and 76% feel frustrated when messages are impersonal.\n\nWelcome emails are your first step to personalized email messages. The email itself is personal — a warm welcome for the new subscriber.\n\nYou can also use the welcome email to gather data for segmentation. Analyze which links the subscriber clicks or directly ask them what types of email they want. It’s as easy as embedding a checklist and inviting the subscriber to select topics.\n\nWelcome emails build stronger connections and cultivate a sense of loyalty to your brand.\n\nBuild an even stronger relationship foundation with an automated welcome series. Instead of sending just one welcome message and then disappearing until your next campaign, you stay top of mind with a series.\n\nFor example, your first message might thank them for joining and invite them to take advantage of a special offer. The second would ask them to follow you on social media, while the third would survey their interests.\n\nYou’ve offered them value and asked them about themselves. Both are good reasons to look forward to your next message.\n\nWouldn’t it be great if you could take customers by the hand and lead them along the path to purchase? A welcome email does precisely that.\n\nWelcome emails give new subscribers a roadmap to the brand. They point out value opportunities and showcase products or services that interest the subscriber.\n\nYou can achieve all of these goals by learning how to write a welcome email. Sounds like a good deal to us.\n\nEvery email needs a visible and easy-to-use unsubscribe option. Anti-spam laws require you to have one and honor any unsubscribe requests within 10 business days.\n\nUnsubscribe buttons also help you keep your email lists clear of people who don’t engage. Once those passive subscribers are gone, you’ll reach a higher percentage of recipients and have a better chance of converting.\n\nLinking your marketing emails to your website is one of the most well-known email marketing best practices — but not all web pages are equally effective. Well-thought-out email marketing plans use landing pages — dedicated web pages created specifically for a marketing campaign.\n\nLanding pages guide readers to the next step in the buyer’s journey. Unlike a homepage or overview products and services page, they focus only on what you’re promoting.\n\nDone right, you’ll improve conversion rates. Using a landing page keeps your prospects focused on the action you want them to take. It allows you to maintain consistent promotional messaging and connects that message to your branding.\n\nAccording to Litmus’s most recent study, 23% of email readers skim messages, meaning they engage for less than eight seconds. In other words, you can recapture about a quarter of your subscribers simply by making your email easy to read quickly.\n\nLike all skimmable web content, an easy-to-skim email uses:\n\nFinally, make sure your call to action is visible and enticing. Action is what all these email marketing best practices are about.\n\nHave a clear focus for your content\n\nTo keep your emails concise, know what your goal is and what you want the reader to do.\n\nFor best results, choose one topic per email. This allows you to keep your email content free from distractions and drives people to take a specific action. If your organization needs to send a newsletter with multiple topics, pick no more than three.\n\nKeep your content on track by answering three questions:\n• What are you offering? — Headline\n• How will it help the reader? — Message body\n• What should they do next? — Call to action\n\nKeep your answers to those questions simple. Provide just enough information and detail to encourage readers to take action. And then, include links to additional or more detailed information.\n\nBrevity also makes your email more skimmable, so it’s a win-win!\n\nBrand voice is the distinct personality your brand takes on in all of your communications. It helps you relate to your target audience.\n\nThe brand voice in your emails should sound like it’s coming from you and reflect the type of product or service you offer.\n\nWith a clear and consistent brand voice, you’ll be able to better connect with your readers and strengthen your overall brand.\n\nIncluding imagery that draws people in and connects readers to your message can help drive results. Impactful imagery invokes an emotional response from readers. Avoid images that look too staged or unnatural by using authentic photos from your day-to-day operations.\n\nTo create impact, capture behind-the-scenes action shots, genuine moments between employees and clients, and show products in use.\n\nIf you have to fill in gaps, use stock imagery sparingly. You can find great visuals on many stock image sites. While some require payment, many offer great quality images for free.\n\nTo avoid legal copyright issues, only use royalty-free images — don’t use imagery found by a search engine.\n\nGive more than you ask for\n\nNo one likes to be sold to all the time. For maximum effectiveness, your email strategy should include a variety of emails that help you build relationships and stay top of mind with your audience.\n\nThink about the 80/20 principle.\n\nBuild relationships, show your expertise, and build trust by providing valuable information 80% of the time. Make sales, receive donations, and get readers to take action with promotional emails the other 20%. This winning combination ensures you are providing value to your readers.\n\nUse call to action buttons that drive traffic\n\nGood call to action (CTA) buttons drive traffic. Great call to action buttons drive more traffic. Include a call to action button in every email you send.\n• Use a contrasting brand color to stand out from the rest of your email content\n• Collect data for marketing analytics and better list segmentation\n• Lead directly to what the reader is expecting\n\nThis last one is important. Readers aren’t going to search around on your website to figure out how to do what it is you want.\n\nUse your CTA button to drive readers directly to the page where they can:\n• Get the information you promised\n• Purchase the product or service you highlighted\n• Register for the event you mentioned\n\nRemember, every email should include a call to action.\n\nLower your unsubscribe rate and improve your email marketing results by sending targeted, personalized content.\n\nPersonalized content for a subscriber could relate to the stage in the buyer’s journey, the products or services they have purchased or have shown interest in, and even the links or topics they click on within an email.\n\nPersonalization starts by segmenting your list into smaller groups of like contacts.\n\nOptimize your email strategy over time. Every business and organization’s audience is different and different audiences respond to different things. Use A/B testing in your email marketing strategy to learn what your audience responds to best.\n\nA/B testing (also known as split testing) is an experiment that involves creating two versions of your emails (option A and option B) and sending them to subsequent groups within your list to see which performs better.\n\nWith strategic use of A/B testing, you’ll discover what content, design, subject lines, and even CTAs work best for your audience.\n\nLook like the professional you are. Minimize errors and typos by listening to that inner high school teacher that bloodied your paper when you didn’t recheck your work before turning it in. Read through your message a few times, looking for errors. Ensure your message is clear and focused, easy to understand, and your readers can complete the action you want them to.\n\nIn Constant Contact, you can use the “Check & Preview” feature to scan for common mistakes. The system will scan your subject line and preheader text, look at your from name and email address, check your hyperlinks and buttons for missing website links, and even check your content for missing & default images and text — brand voice is up to you.\n\nPreview and test your campaign\n\nPreview and test your campaign to ensure there are no hiccups in the reader experience.\n\nVarious email programs and devices may render the design of your email a bit differently. If possible, send a test email to a few different email programs and devices to see how the email design renders in the different formats.\n\nGet a fresh set of eyes on it. Use the test send feature to send a colleague or friend a copy of your email. Ask them to channel their inner high school teacher and check it for errors and typos.\n\nGet it right the first time. Every time. Ensure the images display properly, test all of the links, check personalization features that pull in subscribers’ names or other details, and pay attention to the subject line on each device. You don’t want your email’s subject line to get cut off in the wrong spot, causing an embarrassing situation with your readers.\n\nCheck your reports to see how you’re doing\n\nSave time by getting familiar with your email marketing reports.\n\nKnow what types of things are working and which ones may not be worth your time in the future.\n\nAfter you send an email, you’ll see a wealth of metrics that will tell you how your email performed.\n\nOver time, you’ll be able to look for trends, see who’s engaging or clicking in your messages, and even use the data to segment your list to send more personalized content in your emails.\n\nNote on open rates: Apple’s Mail Privacy Protection feature, released on September 20th, 2021, has made email open rates less reliable. While historical open rate data can still provide valuable insights, we recommend marketers focus on other email marketing metrics, like clicks and conversions, going forward.\n\nSince we’re talking email marketing best practices, the three most important metrics to track are:\n• Unsubscribe rate: The share of recipients that unsubscribe via a marketing email, often because your messages don’t feel relevant\n• Click-through rate: The percentage of people who click on a link in your email, taking the next step toward buying\n• Conversion rate: The ratio of readers who take a desired action, such as making a purchase or joining a loyalty program\n\nAnalyze these metrics over time to see what works for your audiences.\n\nKeep your email list neat and tidy\n\nAn outdated email list can cost you money.\n\nOver time, it’s typical for people to change email addresses, move to new locations, or change companies. It’s even possible for bots to join your email list.\n\nWhen these things happen, and old — useless — email addresses fill up your email lists, not only does it lead to inaccurate data, but you’re likely paying to send out emails that will never reach the intended recipient.Save yourself time and money. Regularly clean your email list — so it’s operating at its best.\n\nUse automation to save time and get timely results\n\nSend timely, relevant emails in less time with email automation. Start your email marketing by automating the welcome emails you send to new contacts; it will help you start the relationship off on the right foot. Then, think about date-based birthday and anniversary emails and set those up to go out automatically as well. These emails are great for building loyalty with your subscribers.\n\nLastly, look at the actions subscribers or how you interact with customers and think about how you can further nurture the relationship.\n\nThis is where a series of emails can help you communicate evergreen content over a period of time to help you meet various goals such as:\n• Educating with your best content\n\nRemember, automated emails help you save time while sending relevant information at the right time.\n\nGet ready to see results!\n\nWe realize that can be a lot to keep track of. So we’ve made it easy for you to follow email marketing best practices with an easy-to-follow checklist.\n\nJust download the checklist and use it to double-check your email campaigns before sending them out. Soon you’ll be creating email campaigns that are more effective and efficient than ever before! You can also read up on email marketing terms you need to know to improve your results."

        "document": "In 2025, Statista predicts consumers will send over 376.4 billion emails daily. With a population of approximately 8.2 billion people, that works out to 46 emails for every person. What does that mean for your email marketing efforts? You have a lot of inbox competition — so making your email stand out is vital if you want clicks and conversions.\n\nThe right email design can make a big difference in your marketing efforts. Every little detail counts, from subject lines to graphics, layout, and typography. Each takes up valuable real estate in your marketing message, so you want to make the most of what you’re working with. With the right combination of email design, messaging, and best practices, you can craft emails that grab your reader’s attention and inspire them to take action.\n\nWith so many emails entering your client’s inbox daily, you want to stand out amongst the crowd. When subscribers open up a lackluster email their attention drops and you might not receive the the follow-up actions you’re hoping for. Instead, your recipient will quickly scan the message and then move on to the next one. That’s not what you want. And it’s not why you worked so hard to build an email list of enthusiastic subscribers.\n\nYou can quickly capture your audience’s attention by incorporating a little style into your message. A fun graphic, exciting layout, and clear links can make a difference in whether your email hits the mark or ends up in the delete pile.\n\nBefore emailing your subscribers, it’s helpful to figure out their pain points and motivations. Knowing what resonates with them — and how your brand can fulfill their needs — can help you craft your email. To understand your target audience, consider their demographics, shopping behaviors, interests, and previous interactions with your business. You can lean on those details as you design your email and draft its contents.\n\nMost brands segment their audience into different groups. Segmentation allows you to send emails that speak to each group, which feels a little more personalized than a single email blast. You may find an email segmentation strategy enhances your results. And when you combine it with excellent email design — well, let’s say that’s gold!\n\nUsing your email marketing goal to inform design\n\nAnother aspect to think about before designing a marketing email is your goal. What are you hoping to accomplish from your message? Do you want to encourage recipients to buy something? Are you providing informative content to establish your credibility? Do you want to confirm a recent order or notify a customer of their abandoned cart?\n\nEvery goal requires a different email design. For instance, an informational marketing email might highlight recent blogs or articles and include short summaries with links to the content. But a sales-oriented email will probably include visuals of your products and a highly visible link for customers who want to buy them.\n\nThere are many different ways you can use email marketing. Consider these ideas.\n\nSending a welcome email is good practice whenever someone subscribes to your email list. In your welcome email, you can thank your new subscriber for joining and provide them with a little information about your brand.\n\nA promotional email is just what it sounds like — an opportunity to promote your products or services. You can use promotional emails to advertise upcoming sales or new items you want your audience to know about.\n\nDoes your company, organization, or subscriber have an upcoming birthday or anniversary? Recognize their big day with a message. Including a little bonus, like a token gift or discount, may encourage them to engage with your brand.\n\nLearn more: Create an Anniversary Email for Your Favorite Donors\n\nIs there an upcoming event you think your subscribers will enjoy? Spread the word through event email marketing! Include a few details so they know how to participate.\n\nDid your subscriber recently purchase something from your organization? If so, send an email confirming their purchase and any other important details, like shipping information.\n\nThere’s more to a marketing email than words. Carefully designed marketing emails combine layout, typography, and visuals to capture the eye and hold the recipient’s attention.\n\nA nice, clean layout is easy on the eye, and your recipient can easily view it on a PC or a mobile device. Generally, most brands follow a simple structure with a header, central message, and footer.\n\nThe header includes things that establish your brand identity, like the company logo and a link to your website. The central area comprises your visuals and content, while the footer contains your contact information.\n\nThe use of color appeals to the reader’s emotions. Each color represents a different emotion, which you can use to influence the reader’s behavior. Of course, you’ll also want to be mindful of your brand’s colors and logo. Using colors that complement your brand identity while appealing to the reader’s emotions is a good idea.\n\nHere’s what each color represents, according to color psychology:\n\nYou might incorporate shapes in your email for a bit of extra flair. For instance, you can use arrows or triangles to drive the eye to specific messaging elements, such as links or calls to action.\n\nThe typography of your email plays a vital role in messaging aesthetics and readability. It can capture the reader’s attention and create message sections. For example, you might use large font headings to separate text into sections. Decorative text, like serif fonts, give an air of sophistication to marketing messages.\n\nVisuals support your email’s copy, helping you engage your audience and make an impression. You can use all types of visuals in your marketing emails, including high-quality photos, fun GIFs, emojis, and descriptive videos.\n\nButtons and links embedded in email copy allow readers to click and take action quickly. You can include links to a landing page, your website, and other relevant content. It’s good practice to highlight links or use large buttons so they’re clearly visible to subscribers.\n\nWhat can you do to truly optimize your marketing emails? Try following these email marketing design best practices:\n\nThink about some of the biggest companies you’re familiar with. Starbucks and Apple might come to mind. And you know what? Both brands use very recognizable design elements in their emails. For Apple, you can expect the Apple logo and a minimalistic approach to copy and color. Starbucks emails include the company’s familiar green and white logo and images of its drinks.\n\nYou can apply the same approach to your email design. Include your company’s logo, and select complementary colors and images that align with your products. Over time, your subscribers will recognize your emails simply through their appearance.\n\nAn email isn’t the place for a ton of longform content. Use email newsletter design principles to create simple and informative messages. Feature links to blogs, product pages, and events and include your newest updates. Keep messaging to a few lines at max, and include graphics and links to get your point across. Your readers can click if they want more information.\n\nThe more personalized messaging you send, the better. Including the reader’s name is a good start, but you can also cater your content to their interests or shopping behaviors. For instance, if you’re sending an abandoned cart email, include pictures of the items they looked at previously to create a personalized experience.\n\nMany of your readers won’t open your message on a PC screen. Instead, they’ll see the email on their smartphone or other mobile device. By formatting your emails using a responsive design that’s viewable on all devices, they won’t have to work hard to view your message.\n\nSome of your subscribers may have disabilities or impairments that make it difficult to view your email. Limited vision can make it hard to view small print, and flashing images or graphics may be dangerous for photo-sensitive individuals. Try accommodating your subscribers using large fonts, including lots of space between lines, and avoiding repetitive, animated GIFs.\n\nDesigning your first marketing email is fun, but you may want some inspiration. Here’s a trick — sign up for emails from a few brands you like and see how they design their messages. You can pick companies outside your industry or choose a few competitors (or both)! Of course, you want to set yourself apart and establish your own brand identity, but getting an idea of how other brands use marketing emails can help you establish a strategy and create a definitive email template design.\n\nHere’s a look at some brands that know how to leverage email design practices and what makes them stand out.\n\nThis marketing email from GoNanas uses a straightforward email header design. It breaks apart the content into two sections with large font headers, plus a shorter section with a descriptive summary of the product. At the bottom is an engaging call to action button for subscribers who decide to purchase.\n\nRay-Ban’s email includes bold headings and a stunning image to capture the recipient’s attention. Notice its use of color — the white glasses nicely complement the headlines and brand logo.\n\nTaco Bell’s email begins with a header featuring its logo and helpful links. The word “Drops” is incorporated with a typography twist to add a unique spin to the design.\n\nEverlywell incorporates color psychology into its messaging. Notice the use of green, which is associated with health — perfect for a healthcare company.\n\nUse data to drive better email designs\n\nHow do you know your email design is working? Check your analytics. Compare and contrast your results from each email you send to see which types perform the best. You can also try different designs to see which best captures your audience’s attention. For instance, if emails with high-quality photos perform well but text-only content doesn’t, you know your audience likes visuals. Similarly, you may play around with length to see if longer or shorter content performs better.\n\nEmail heat maps show precisely how subscribers interact with the different elements of your email. With a heat map, you’ll see the content they scrolled, clicked on, or spent a more extended time reviewing. You can use a heat map to see which email elements are the most important to subscribers, helping to improve your future messaging strategy.\n\nWhen sending marketing emails, you need software to optimize your email design. Constant Contact provides the flexibility and features you’re looking for. With Constant Contact, you can easily create a no-code email using a drag-and-drop email builder, no tech skills required! It’s a simple way to craft professional emails that resonate with subscribers.\n\nHowever, you’re not limited to drag-and-drop. If you prefer more customization, you can design your messages in HTML. Constant Contact can even create your emails from uploaded PDFs, which you can edit and save as a messaging template.\n\nConstant Contact makes it super easy to stay on brand BrandKit.

Constant Contact provides a user-friendly platform that simplifies the process of designing, customizing, and sending emails.\n\nWhen designing your email, it's important to follow best practices to ensure your message is clear and impactful. Start with a visual hierarchy, placing the most important information at the top to grab attention quickly.

Constant Contact offers a wide range of mobile-responsive templates designed to look great on all devices.

Consider personalizing the subject line and other optimization considerations to make sure your email stands out in the inbox."

        "document": "If time is money, it’s a waste of both to reinvent the wheel by creating a new email from scratch whenever you want to connect with a sales prospect. Yet, that’s precisely what many salespeople do when they haven’t yet created an effective sales email template.\n\nAs a professional writer and marketing consultant, I know how challenging it is for people who aren’t writers or designers to whip out a fresh email message that hits the mark for the target audience. My clients constantly tell me stories about staring at the blank screen, waiting for a vision.\n\nBut you don’t need divine inspiration — what you need are professional email templates. An email template is a pre-designed file with reusable code that lets you quickly copy and paste your text and images into a digital form. Templates provide a structure for you to craft a message with personalized content designed for your potential customers.\n\nWhat’s more, email marketing platforms like Constant Contact have scores of templates to choose from that will make your emails look like you hired a designer to help. You don’t need to know coding or how the backend of a system works — but your customer base will think you do.\n\nWhy sales email templates are crucial for your business\n\nThere are plenty of reasons why it’s worth the time it takes upfront to integrate sales templates into your current prospecting protocol. These include:\n• Increased productivity: Email templates will save the time it takes to create an entirely new design from scratch. This means your sales team can spend more time researching and developing new prospects or working with your marketing team to initiate a new sales funnel.\n• Improved client experience: Emails that look aesthetically pleasing and are clearly structured to convey information effectively are always more welcomed than emails that lack a good graphic design and layout. When you integrate a sales email template into an email outreach campaign, you present the best first impression possible.\n• Better communication: Templates create a structure that helps readers know what to expect. For example, most people know to look for a caption underneath an image to explain why the image is there. When you work within a predetermined design, you send something familiar — even if you’ve never sent the recipient anything before.\n• Enhanced brand consistency: Templates almost always provide a space for your logo, but that’s just the beginning. When your business uses templates to create an email campaign, you’ll send a similar structure with a consistent format. This means you can choose a color scheme, font style, and other elemental design decisions in advance — and use them every time.\n• Fewer errors: Best of all, when you don’t have to create an initial email from scratch each time, you’ll have more time to double-check your work for errors. Templates also ensure you don’t overlook planned elements by providing a specific space for each section of your email. With the extra time saved by sales and marketing automation, you can craft your email messages more strategically for an improved response rate.\n\nBy now, you’re probably wondering how to choose an email template. First, you should browse the offerings on your email marketing platform, starting within your industry. For example, some templates are ideal for wellness and health brands with a very different look and feel from those designed for financial or insurance institutions.\n\nAlways consider what kind of design will appeal to your target audience. Then, look at how easily you can integrate your message into the template structure. If you have many different elements, look for one that has more of a “newsletter” feel. If you have a simpler idea for your sales emails, choosing a more basic template may be appropriate.\n\nYou can’t go wrong using a professionally designed sales email template and following these seven best practices when crafting your messages.\n\nAll sales email templates will have a space for you to add a subject line, which is perhaps the most crucial element. The subject line is the first thing a recipient will see when they open their inbox, and they may decide right then that the message does not apply to them and not even open it. Thankfully, you have the power to initiate a better response.\n• Are concise enough to be read fully in the small space provided in an email inbox.\n• Describe the email’s take-away message honestly and clearly.\n• Do not have too many exclamation points or capitalization issues, which can trigger SPAM blockers.\n• Have few, if any, emojis.\n• May be personalized with the recipient’s name.\n\nIf you’re unsure whether your subject lines are effective, test multiple angles to see which has better reply rates. This practice is known as A/B testing.\n\n2. Personalize the email for your target audience\n\nOnce you’ve succeeded in getting the recipient to open messages as part of your email campaigns, you’ll want to let them know right away that you are sending it to them for a specific reason. A quick way to accomplish this is through personalization, which goes beyond simply adding their name to the top of the email.\n\nPersonalization also means being strategic in sending targeted messages to narrowly focused audiences. If your sales reps often receive leads from event signups, it’s a good idea to create a dynamic content block in your email template so the recipient will see a reference to the event they attended — and not some other event. You should also add a greeting tag in your email so it’s clear that you’re addressing them personally.\n\nBasically, the more you can make the message look like they are the only person to receive it, the less likely they will ignore it.\n\n3. Keep the email concise and focused\n\nNever ramble! The best email examples don’t waste the time of the person reading it. You aren’t going to get more interest simply because your email is pages long. It’s better to have a short, focused message that lets the recipient know you respect their time and interests.\n\nHowever, getting to the point may be more complicated than it sounds. An effective email must pass through several stages before you hit send. Write it, and then take a break before returning and editing it. Always look for ways to streamline your message, as you won’t have a predetermined word count.\n\n4. Clearly communicate the value proposition\n\nAs you’re returning to and reviewing your work, immediately clarify what you have to offer. Your sales teams have likely already done their homework about your target audience’s pain points and needs, so it should be obvious how your product or service meets their needs.\n\nDon’t make the recipient guess how your value proposition will benefit them. Be very clear about what makes your company and your value first, best, or different from the competition.\n\nDon’t be shy about being direct with your call to action or CTA. Use active and short commands, such as “act now” or “contact us today.” You demonstrate confidence with this expression of your value.\n\nThere are endless call-to-action ideas, so you can be creative using language that resonates with your target audience. For example, if the prospect company is very formal, stick to that tone. If you are targeting a younger demographic, you may be able to have more fun.\n\nThe message in your sales email template should include language designed to impact the recipient’s behavior, which can be done using three main techniques.\n• Ethical persuasion appeals to a person’s moral compass. An example could be a message highlighting a product’s reduced packaging and toxin-free formula. This would appeal to a person’s ethical interest in protecting the environment or leading a healthy lifestyle.\n• Emotional persuasion taps into the recipient’s feelings of happiness, sadness, fear, excitement, or any other emotion. When you say they’ll only have a day after receiving the email to act on a special deal, you are persuading them through excitement and the fear that they’ll miss out.\n• Logical persuasion is used to show that it just makes sense for the person to do business with you. For example, if you highlight social proof through customer testimonials or by explaining how a high percentage of people love your products, you’re suggesting that potential customers will feel the same after purchasing.\n\nYou may find that one kind of persuasive language is more appropriate or effective in your call to action than others. Again, consider your target audience when employing one of these techniques.\n\nCalls to action work best when you do not give the recipient time to set your offer aside. As you know, tasks that can wait until tomorrow usually don’t get done until then. If there’s no deadline, it may never get done.\n\nCombine direct, persuasive language with a sense of urgency. Set a timetable for their action without fear that you’re asking too much. If they don’t reply, you can always send a follow-up email.\n\nFinally, a call to action should visually jump out at the reader. This may mean using a graphic design “button,” a brightly colored box or icon with a few words, and a link to a landing page on your website. Or, it may be better to simply add bold font to words used as a link. Whichever you choose, ensure that your eye is drawn to your email as you review it.\n\nWhile the CTA button in the example above is black, would it have stood out more if it had been the same shade of red that’s in the image? If your CTA button doesn’t stand out as much as you’d like — or perhaps stands out a little too much — you can always A/B test it, just like any other part of your sales email template.\n\nSpeaking of drawing your eyes to certain places within your sales email template, you’ll also want to include visuals along with the text of your message. Perhaps the best part of using a template is that it’s easy to drag-and-drop compelling images into your messages without worrying about it looking like a jumbled mess.\n\nHowever, try to avoid too many stock photos if you can. Visual elements should be included for a clear intention rather than simply filler. For inspiration, look critically at sales promotion examples that arrive in your inbox.\n\nJust as your text should be clearly directed to your target audience, so should your visuals. Always think about what will resonate with the recipient. This may mean considering the demographics of people portrayed in photos or landscapes that reflect certain geographic locations.\n\nAsk your current customers for testimonials of your products or services, and then transfer those into a visual format. You can use a free graphic design software program like Canva, which also uses templates to make it relatively easy to create a professional look. You can make the testimonial stand out with bright colors and different fonts.\n\nUsing your products as visual elements in your sales email template can also make a lot of sense. To do this well, use a good camera with good light. If you have the budget, hire a professional photographer to create a portfolio of product images.\n\nFinally, you don’t have to save A/B testing for just your subject lines. Track your metrics, such as open rate or sales conversions, to see your efforts’ effectiveness during a specific period. Then, use that data to experiment and find ways to improve your work.\n\nEmail templates can be an extremely effective way to save time and improve the likelihood that your sales message will land with your prospects. Your emails will look better and take less time to craft —and you’ll never be caught staring anxiously at a blank screen.\n\nTo integrate email templates into your sales workflow, start by browsing through the different options in your email marketing platform. Pick out a few and take time to consider which one will best resonate with your target audience. There’s no need to rush the decision, knowing you’ll save this time in the future."

        "document": "We know that as a small business owner, you wear many hats and your time is precious. That's why we've put together an article packed with email best practices specifically tailored for you. Discover how to save time, simplify your email marketing efforts, and achieve better results. Get ready to boost your business with these best practices!\n\nCustomize your template to reflect your unique brand identity. In the world of email marketing, branding is essential. Your brand is the core of your business or organization, representing who you are and what you offer. When recipients open your emails, they should instantly recognize your brand. Achieve this by prominently featuring your logo at the top and incorporating your brand colors throughout the template. For a fully branded experience, ensure consistency in your content's tone, imagery style, logo placement, and even the customized footer. And don’t forget to optimize your emails for mobile devices!\n\n\n\nYou have a mere three seconds to capture someone's attention and entice them to open your email. The subject line of your email may consist of just one line of text, but it holds the power to determine whether your email gets opened or discarded. A concise and direct subject line that accurately conveys the benefits for your subscriber can be highly effective. However, depending on your brand's tone, you might consider incorporating personalization, emojis, numbers, or even a sense of urgency when appropriate. You can always utilize A/B testing to determine what resonates best with your audience.\n\n\n\nImagine your email inbox. Can you visualize a snippet of the message displayed below the subject line? That's what we call preview text, or if you want to sound fancy, an \"email preheader.\" And guess what? It functions just like a movie preview. First, someone reads the subject line and becomes mildly intrigued. Then, they catch a glimpse of your captivating preview and suddenly feel the urge to click! It's undeniably one of the most gratifying best practices in email marketing. To cut through the noise and earn those clicks, create a short and compelling preview text using Constant Contact's email preheader feature.\n\n\n\nSegmentation involves dividing your contact list into smaller groups to deliver tailored and personalized information and offers. Begin by considering what aligns with your objectives and resonates with your audience. This could include creating smaller lists based on interests, demographics, or preferences for specific products or ser.... You can automate the segmentation process by tracking the actions your contacts take within your emails. For example, the click segmentation feature in Constant Contact automatically adds contacts to a segmented list when they click on a link in your email.\n\n\n\nDemonstrate your commitment to your subscribers' experience by utilizing an email address that is actively monitored. After perusing your email, subscribers may have inquiries, and it should be effortless for them to seek answers. What could be simpler than clicking the \"reply\" button conveniently located at the top of their email? Opt for an email address that exudes approachability and assures recipients that a member of your team will respond. For example, use a reply email address associated with an employee or a customer service inbox, such as \"hello@yourdomain.com,\" \"info@yourdomain.com,\" or \"questions@yourdomain.com.\"\n\n\n\nConsider welcome emails as the gracious host of a delightful dinner party. The host should greet your subscribers with a smile, introduce them to the experience, and provide a tantalizing glimpse of what lies ahead. A well-written welcome email lets guests know what to expect and sets the tone for the kind of information you share — and, more importantly, how valuable that information is!\n\n\n\nMake sure every email has a clear and user-friendly way to unsubscribe. It's not just a legal requirement to comply with anti-spam laws, but it's also important to respect people's preferences. You should honor any unsubscribe requests within 10 business days.\n\n\n\nUnsubscribe buttons also come in handy for keeping your email lists free from inactive subscribers. By removing those who don't engage, you'll have a higher chance of reaching more recipients and increasing your conversion rates.\n\n\n\nLanding pages are dedicated web pages designed specifically for your marketing campaigns.They serve as a guide for readers, directing them to the next step in their buyer's journey. Unlike a homepage or a general products and services page, landing pages solely focus on what you're promoting. When done right, landing pages can significantly improve your conversion rates. By using a landing page, you can keep your prospects focused on the specific action you want them to take. It allows you to maintain consistent promotional messaging and seamlessly aligns with your branding.\n\n\n\nAccording to a recent study by Litmus, 23% of email readers quickly skim through messages, spending less than eight seconds on each. This means that by making your emails easy to read at a glance, you can recapture the attention of about a quarter of your subscribers.\n\nTo create skimmable emails, follow these best practices:\n• Use short paragraphs and provide enough white space.\n• Ensure your call to action is visible and compelling.\n\nWhen crafting your email content, have a clear focus and goal in mind. Stick to one topic per email to avoid distractions and prompt readers to take a specific action. Keep your message concise by answering three key questions:\n• What are you offering?\n• How will it benefit the reader?\n• What should they do next?\n\nUse a simple and authentic brand voice that reflects your organization's personality and resonates with your target audience. By maintaining a consistent brand voice, you can establish a stronger connection with your readers and enhance your overall brand image.\n\n\n\nCaptivating images that resonate with your audience can make a real difference in driving results. When selecting visuals, aim for ones that spark an emotional response from readers. Steer clear of overly staged or artificial-looking images by opting for authentic photos that showcase your day-to-day operations.\n\nTo create a lasting impact, consider capturing behind-the-scenes action shots, genuine moments between your team and clients, and images that showcase your products in use. If you need additional visuals, use stock imagery sparingly.\n\nThere are plenty of stock image sites that offer high-quality visuals, some of which are free to use. Just make sure to choose royalty-free images to avoid any copyright issues. Remember, it's best to avoid using images found through search engines to stay on the safe side.\n\nYou can also use animated GIFs or design eye-popping graphics in Canva to insert directly into your email campaign!\n\n\n\nNobody wants to feel like they're constantly being bombarded with sales pitches. To really make an impact with your email strategy, it's important to share a variety of emails and focus on building relationships with your audience. Here's a handy principle to keep in mind: the 80/20 rule.\n\nSpend 80% of your email efforts on nurturing relationships, showcasing your expertise, and earning trust by sharing valuable information. Then, reserve the remaining 20% for promotional emails that drive sales, encourage donations, or prompt readers to take action. This balanced approach ensures that you're consistently providing value to your readers while still achieving your goals.\n\n\n\nCall to action (CTA) buttons can make a big difference in driving traffic to your desired destination. You should include one in every single email you send! For example, you might want customers to:\n• Access the information you promised them.\n• Make a purchase for the highlighted product or service.\n• Register for the event you mentioned.\n\nSo, what makes a call to action button great? Here are a few key characteristics to keep in mind:\n• Make sure it stands out by using a contrasting brand color that catches the reader's eye.\n• Keep it short, snappy, and crystal clear so there's no confusion about what action you want them to take.\n• Use it as an opportunity to collect valuable data for marketing analytics and to segment your email list effectively.\n• Make sure your CTA button leads directly to what the reader is expecting. Don't make them search around your website.\n\n\n\nWant to make sure you come across as a pro? Don't let those pesky errors and typos ruin your image. Remember that strict high school teacher who marked up your paper when you didn't proofread? Well, channel that inner teacher and give your message a thorough read-through. Look out for any mistakes and make sure your message is crystal clear, focused, and easy to understand. And most importantly, make sure your readers can take the action you want them to. In Constant Contact, you can use the handy \"Check & Preview\" feature to catch common mistakes. It'll scan your subject line, preheader text, from name, email address, hyperlinks, buttons, and even your content for missing website links, images, and text. You get to decide the brand voice, so make it your own!\n\n\n\nIt's crucial to continuously fine-tune your email strategy for optimal results. After all, every business or organization has a unique audience, and different folks respond to different things. That's where A/B testing comes in handy as a valuable tool in your email marketing arsenal.\n\nA/B testing, also known as split testing, is like conducting an experiment. You create two versions of your emails – let's call them option A and option B – and send them to different groups within your email list. The goal? To see which version performs better and resonates more with your audience.\n\nBy strategically implementing A/B testing, you'll gain valuable insights into what content, design elements, subject lines, and even call-to-action (CTA) buttons work best for your specific audience. It's all about finding the winning combination that truly connects with your readers and drives the results you're aiming for.\n\n\n\nOnce you hit that send button, a treasure trove of metrics awaits you, revealing how your email performed. These insights will give you a clear picture of what's working and what might not be worth your effort in the future.\n\nOver time, you'll start noticing trends and patterns. You'll be able to identify who's actively engaging with your messages, who's clicking on your links, and even use this data to segment your email list for more personalized content.\n\nHere are some key reports you'll come across:\n• Opens: How many people opened your email.\n• Bounce rate: The percentage of emails that didn't reach their intended recipients.\n• Click-through rate: The number of people who clicked on links within your email.\n• Spam reports: Any reports of your email being marked as spam.\n• Unsubscribes/opt-outs: The number of people who decided to unsubscribe from your emails.\n\nNow, it's important to note that open rates may not be as reliable due to Apple's Mail Privacy Protection feature. While historical open rate data can still provide insights, it's recommended to focus on other metrics like clicks and conversions moving forward.\n\nWithin the reports, there are three key metrics you should track:\n• Unsubscribe rate: This indicates the percentage of recipients who unsubscribe, often because they don't find your messages relevant.\n• Click-through rate: It shows the percentage of people who click on links in your email, showing their interest and taking the next step towards making a purchase.\n• Conversion rate: This measures the ratio of readers who take a desired action, such as making a purchase or joining a loyalty program.\n\nBy analyzing these metrics over time, you'll gain valuable insights into what resonates with your audience and can tailor your email strategy accordingly. It's all about finding what works best for your unique audience and driving those desired results.\n\nWe want to hear from you!
