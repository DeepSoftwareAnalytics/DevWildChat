        "document": "How to Convert HEIC to JPG: A Comprehensive Guide\n\nEver found yourself marveling at the brilliance of Apple’s devices, especially with how they display images? That’s partly thanks to HEIC, a game-changing image format. But what makes this format so special, and why is there an increasing need to convert HEIC to JPG?\n\nAdopted by Apple, High Efficiency Image Container (HEIC) is the default image format for all Apple devices since iOS 11. But why did Apple choose this format? It’s not just about high efficiency in name but in function too. With its advanced compression techniques, HEIC offers smaller file sizes without compromising image quality, often outperforming JPEG/JPG. Think of it as getting more visual bang for your storage buck.\n\nBefore diving into conversion methods, it’s worth noting that there are multiple approaches to dealing with HEIC files, from built-in tools like Preview on macOS to simple settings changes on your iPhone, and even third-party apps for batch processing, and even offline solutions for those prioritizing privacy. Options like DocuFreezer and ImageMagick cater specifically to users looking for flexible and robust conversion tools that don’t rely on an internet connection. Additionally, tools like Canva let you edit and enhance photos before converting, adding even more versatility to your workflow.\n\nBut here’s a pertinent question: if it’s so efficient, why do we ever need to convert HEIC to JPG? And when we do, what are the best ways to ensure a seamless transition between these formats? This article will guide you on a journey to understand the nuances of the HEIC file format, its distinct advantages, and the pragmatic reasons behind converting it to the universally recognized JPG format. Plus, for all the Mac users out there, we’ve got some tailored advice just for you.\n• How to Convert HEIC to JPG\n\nHEIC was created by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) and was adopted by Apple as their go-to image format for devices starting from iOS 11.\n\nBut what makes HEIC stand out in the vast ocean of image formats? It’s uncanny ability to combine compression with quality. Imagine fitting a vast, detailed landscape into a compact suitcase without wrinkling or losing a single detail. That’s HEIC for you – storing brilliant images in a fraction of the space. No more fretting over storage space or compromising on image quality!\n\nLearn more about HEIC in the video below.\n\n\n\nWhile the HEIC format boasts excellent compression and quality, it’s not as universally accepted as JPG. Here are some reasons to convert HEIC to JPG:\n• Universality and Compatibility . As outstanding as HEIC is, it’s still the new kid on the block. JPG, with its long-standing legacy, has become the standard of image formats. It’s understood and accepted almost everywhere, from that old photo viewer on your PC to the website you’re uploading an image to. Until HEIC becomes as widespread, converting to JPG ensures your images are accessible everywhere.\n• Ease of Sharing . Because HEIC isn’t as widely adopted, it makes it more difficult to share or use it on other devices. Switching to JPG ensures your photos can be shared and used as much as you need to, without worrying about compatability issues.\n• Editing and Tools . While many modern editing tools have embraced HEIC, not all have. If you’re an artist or a designer, or simply someone who loves tweaking their photos to perfection, converting to JPG can often be the easier choice. Additionally, tools like Canva offer the ability to edit and enhance your photos before conversion, making it a favorite among creators.\n• Proactive Camera Settings. If you often need JPGs, you can save yourself the trouble of converting later by changing your iPhone settings. Go to Settings > Camera > Formats and select Most Compatible. This ensures your photos are saved in JPG format directly.\n\nWhile HEIC has its clear advantages, it still has a lot of catching up to do when compared to older image formats. Especially when compared to JPG, HEIC still seems too new to be widely used, but that won’t last forever.\n\nHow To Change HEIC to JPG\n\nBecause of the lack of widespread adoption of HEIC files, converting them to JPG is fairly common. We’re going to show you several easy ways you can convert HEIC to JPG, so you don’t get left in the dust.\n\nConvert HEIC to JPG on MacOS using Preview\n\nConverting HEIC files to JPG on a Mac is straightforward with the built-in Preview application:\n• Open the HEIC file .

Launch the Photos app and locate the HEIC photo you want to convert.\n• Initiate Export . Click on the ellipsis icon (three dots).\n• Change the File Type .

        "document": "I had previously always manually transferred my photos from my iPhone via Windows Explorer on my PC. Unfortunately this has become very unstable in the last couple of years since the introduction of HEIC with iOS11; not to mention it is also extremely slow transferring 4k 60FPS video over USB 2.0, but that's another conversation topic entirely.\n\nI migrated to PhotoTransferApp last year which solved a lot of my problems, but again batch transferring anything in excess of 100 photos from my iPhone becomes unstable and is very time consuming (I routinely transfer 1000-2000 photos at a time). I therefore decided to start using iCloud photos to store all my images in the cloud. This gives me then benefit of an online backup and I hoped would make transferring large volumes of photos easier.\n\nI have installed iCloud for Windows 11.4 (having migrated from the standalone app 7.19) and all is working correctly; however I was disappointed to find all my photos in the iCloud Photos folder on Windows Explorer show as HEIC format. Previously when copying photos from my iPhone a JPEG copy was always downloaded as per my \"Transfer to Mac and or PC\" settings on my iPhone. I had assumed iCloud would adopt the same settings but perhaps not.\n\nIs there any way I can download JPEG copies of my photos directly from the iCloud directory on my computer, or can this be done within the online portal? I would ideally like to avoid converting thousands of HEIC photos manually on my PC."

        "document": "I often need to bulk convert HEIC photos to JPG format when using my iPhone. I found a simple trick to send the photos to myself directly by email. This method is super convenient and does not require installing any additional software.\n\nIt is also very straightforward to use: I just need to select the HEIC photos I want to convert in the album, then click the share button like sharing anything, and select the email app. In the email writing interface, after I add the photos, the iPhone will automatically prompt me if I want to convert HEIC to JPEG format and send them. I choose \"yes\", set the email address to my own, and send it. Not long after, the email arrived in my inbox, and when I opened it, I saw that the photos were already in JPEG format.\n\nThe advantage of this method is that it is simple to operate, and there is no need to worry about the quality of the pictures, because the quality is basically the same during the conversion process. Of course, this method is more suitable for converting a few pictures occasionally. If it is hundreds or thousands of HEIC pictures, you may need to consider other more automated batch processing methods."
