This comprehensive guide will walk you through the key steps and best practices for writing test benches in Verilog, offering valuable insights and tips to enhance your verification process.\n\nA test bench is a simulation environment that allows designers to validate the functionality of their Verilog modules before synthesizing them into actual hardware. It serves as a virtual platform where different test scenarios are executed, enabling comprehensive testing and debugging.\n\nWriting a well-structured and efficient test bench is essential for identifying and rectifying design flaws early in the development cycle, ultimately saving time and resources.\n\nBegin by instantiating the Verilog module that you intend to test within your test bench. This involves creating an instance of the module and connecting it to the necessary input and output ports.\n\nTest vectors are sets of input values that are applied to the module during simulation. Develop a mechanism to generate comprehensive test vectors that cover various input scenarios. This ensures thorough testing of the module’s functionality.\n\nIf your design involves clocked elements, create a clock signal and, if necessary, a reset signal. This allows you to simulate the behavior of sequential logic and synchronous circuits accurately.\n\nIncorporate assertions and monitors into your test bench to automatically check for specific conditions or errors during simulation. This helps catch bugs early in the verification process.\n\nDesign your test bench in a modular fashion, making it easy to adapt and reuse for different projects. Create separate modules for test vector generation, clock, reset generation, and result checking.\n\nImplement coverage analysis to ensure that your test vectors exercise all possible paths and conditions within the module. This helps identify areas of the design that may require additional testing.\n\nIntroduce randomness in your test vectors to explore corner cases and unexpected scenarios. This is particularly useful for uncovering hard-to-find bugs that may not be apparent with deterministic test vectors.\n\nMaintain thorough documentation for your test bench code. Clearly explain the purpose of each module, the rationale behind test vectors, and any assumptions made during the verification process. This documentation will be invaluable for future developers and collaborators.\n\nFamiliarize yourself with the simulation tools available for Verilog, such as ModelSim or VCS, and utilize their debugging features. Efficient debugging is essential for quickly identifying and resolving issues in your test bench.\n\nWriting effective test benches in Verilog is a crucial step in the hardware design and verification process. By following best practices and incorporating key components into your test bench, you can ensure thorough testing and early detection of potential issues in your digital designs.\n\nRemember to focus on modularity, coverage analysis, randomization, documentation, and simulation debugging to enhance the reliability and efficiency of your verification process. With a well-designed test bench, you can confidently move forward in the development cycle, knowing that your Verilog modules have been rigorously tested and validated."

        "document": "In this post we look at how we use Verilog to write a basic testbench. We start by looking at the architecture of a Verilog testbench before considering some key concepts in verilog testbench design. This includes modelling time in verilog, the initial block, verilog-initial-block and the verilog system tasks. Finally, we go through a complete verilog testbench example.\n\nWhen using verilog to design digital circuits, we normally also create a testbench to stimulate the code and ensure that it functions as expected.\n\nWe can write our testbench using a variety of languages, with VHDL, Verilog and System Verilog being the most popular.\n\nSystem Verilog is widely adopted in industry and is probably the most common language to use. If you are hoping to design FPGAs professionally, then it will be important to learn this skill at some point.\n\nAs it is better to focus on one language as a time, this blog post introduces the basic principles of testbench design in verilog. This allows us to test designs while working through the verilog tutorials on this site.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about testbench design using either verilog or SystemVerilog, then there are several excellent courses paid course available on sites such as udemy.\n\nTestbenches consist of non-synthesizable verilog code which generates inputs to the design and checks that the outputs are correct.\n\nThe diagram below shows the typical architecture of a simple testbench.\n\nThe stimulus block generates the inputs to our FPGA design and the output checker tests the outputs to ensure they have the correct values.\n\nThe stimulus and output checker will be in separate files for larger designs. It is also possible to include all of these different elements in a single file.\n\nThe main purpose of this post is to introduce the skills which will allow us to test our solutions to the exercises on this site.\n\nTherefore, we don’t discuss the output checking block as it adds unnecessary complexity.\n\nInstead, we can use a simulation tool which allows for waveforms to be viewed directly. The freely available software packages from Xilinx (Vivado) and Intel (Quartus) both offer this capability.\n\nAlternatively, open source tools such as icarus verilog can be used in conjunction with GTKWave to run verilog simulations.\n\nWe can also make use of EDA playground which is a free online verilog simulation tool.\n\nIn this case, we would need to use system tasks to monitor the outputs of our design. This gives us a textual output which we can use to check the state of our signals at given times in our simulation.\n\nThe first step in writing a testbench is creating a verilog module which acts as the top level of the test.\n\nUnlike the verilog modules we have discussed so far, we want to create a module which has no inputs or outputs in this case. This is because we want the testbench module to be totally self contained.\n\nThe code snippet below shows the syntax for an empty module which we can use as our testbench.\n\nAfter we have created a testbench module, we must then instantiate the design which we are testing. This allows us to connect signals to the design in order to stimulate the code.\n\nWe have already discussed how we instantiate modules in the previous post on verilog modules. However, the code snippet below shows how this is done using named instantiation.\n\nOnce we have done this, we are ready to start writing our stimulus to the FPGA. This includes generating the clock and reset, as well creating test data to send to the FPGA.\n\nIn order to this we need to use some verilog constructs which we have not yet encountered – initial blocks, forever loops and time consuming statements.\n\nWe will look at these in more detail before we go through a complete verilog testbench example.\n\nOne of the key differences between testbench code and design code is that we don’t need to synthesize the testbench.\n\nAs a result of this, we can use special constructs which consume time. In fact, this is crucial for creating test stimulus.\n\nWe have a construct available to us in Verilog which enables us to model delays. In verilog, we use the # character followed by a number of time units to model delays.\n\nAs an example, the verilog code below shows an example of using the delay operator to wait for 10 time units.\n\nOne important thing to note here is that there is no semi-colon at the end of the code. When we write code to model a delay in Verilog, this would actually result in compilation errors.\n\nIt is also common to write the delay in the same line of code as the assignment. This effectively acts as a scheduler, meaning that the change in signal is scheduled to take place after the delay time.\n\nThe code snippet below shows an example of this type of code.\n\nSo far, we have talked about delays which are ten units of time. This is fairly meaningless until we actually define what time units we should use.\n\nIn order to specify the time units that we use during simulation, we use a verilog compiler directive which specifies the time unit and resolution. We only need to do this once in our testbench and it should be done outside of a module.\n\nThe code snippet below shows the compiler directive we use to specify the time units in verilog.\n\nWe use the <unit_time> field to specify the main time unit of our testbench and the <resolution> field to define the resolution of the time units in our simulation.\n\nThe <resolution> field is important as we can use non-integer numbers to specify the delay in our verilog code. For example, if we want to have a delay of 10.5ns, we could simply write #10.5 as the delay.\n\nTherefore, the <resolution> field in the compiler directive determines the smallest time step we can actually model in our Verilog code.\n\nBoth of the fields in this compiler directive take a time type such as 1ps or 1ns.\n\nIn the post on always blocks in verilog, we saw how we can use procedural blocks to execute code sequentially.\n\nAnother type of procedural block which we can use in verilog is known as the initial block.\n\nAny code which we write inside an initial block is executed once, and only once, at the beginning of a simulation.\n\nThe verilog code below shows the syntax we use for an initial block.\n\nUnlike the always block, verilog code written within initial block is not synthesizable. As a result of this, we use them almost exclusively for simulation purposes.\n\nHowever, we can also use initial blocks in our verilog RTL to initialise signals.\n\nWhen we write stimulus code in our verilog testbench we almost always use the initial block.\n\nTo give a better understanding of how we use the initial block to write stimulus in verilog, let’s consider a basic example.\n\nFor this example imagine that we want to test a basic two input and gate.\n\nTo do this, we would need code which generates each of the four possible input combinations.\n\nIn addition, we would also need to use the delay operator in order to wait for some time between generating the inputs.\n\nThis is important as it allows time for the signals to propagate through our design.\n\nThe verilog code below shows the method we would use to write this test within an initial block.\n\nAlthough we haven’t yet discussed loops, they can be used to perform important functions in Verilog. In fact, we will discuss verilog loops in detail in a later post in this series\n\nHowever, there is one important type of loop which we can use in a verilog testbench – the forever loop.\n\nWhen we use this construct we are actually creating an infinite loop. This means we create a section of code which runs contimnuously during our simulation.\n\nThe verilog code below shows the syntax we use to write forever loops.\n\nWhen writing code in other programming languages, we would likely consider an infinite loop as a serious bug which should be avoided.\n\nHowever, we must remember that verilog is not like other programming languages. When we write verilog code we are describing hardware and not writing software.\n\nTherefore, we have at least one case where we can use an infinite loop – to generate a clock signal in our verilog testbench.\n\nTo do this, we need a way of continually inverting the signal at regular intervals. The forever loop provides us with an easy method to implement this.\n\nThe verilog code below shows how we can use the forever loop to generate a clock in our testbench. It is important to note that any loops we write must be contained with in a procedural block or generate block.\n\nWhen we write testbenches in verilog, we have some inbuilt tasks and functions which we can use to help us.\n\nCollectively, these are known as system tasks or system functions and we can identify them easily as they always begin wtih a dollar symbol.\n\nThere are actually several of these tasks available. However, we will only look at three of the most commonly used verilog system tasks – $display, $monitor and $time.\n\nThe $display function is one of the most commonly used system tasks in verilog. We use this to output a message which is displayed on the console during simulation.\n\nWe use the $display macro in a very similar way to the printf function in C.\n\nThis means we can easily create text statements in our testbench and use them to display information about the status of our simulation.\n\nWe can also use a special character (%) in the string to display signals in our design. When we do this we must also include a format letter which tells the task what format to display the variable in.\n\nThe most commonly used format codes are b (binary), d (decimal) and h (hex). We can also include a number in front of this format code to determine the number of digits to display.\n\nThe verilog code below shows the general syntax for the $display system task. This code snippet also includes an example use case.\n\nThe full list of different formats we can use with the $display system task are shown in the table below.\n\nThe $monitor function is very similar to the $display function, except that it has slightly more intelligent behaviour.\n\nWe use this function to monitor the value of signals in our testbench and display a message whenever one of these signals changes state.\n\nAll system tasks are actually ignored by the synthesizer so we could even include $monitor statements in our verilog RTL code, although this is not common.\n\nThe general syntax for this system task is shown in the code snippet below. This code snippet also includes an example use case.\n\nThe final system task which we commonly use in testbenches is the $time function. We use this system task to get the current simulation time.\n\nIn our verilog testbenches, we commonly use the $time function together with either the $display or $monitor tasks to display the time in our messages.\n\nThe verilog code below shows how we use the $time and $display tasks together to create a message.\n\nNow that we have discussed the most important topics for testbench design, let’s consider a compete example.\n\nWe will use a very simple circuit for this and build a testbench which generates every possible input combination.\n\nThe circuit shown below is the one we will use for this example. This consists of a simple two input and gate as well as a flip flip.\n\nThe first thing we do in the testbench is declare an empty module to write our testbench code in.\n\nThe code snippet below shows the declaration of the module for this testbench.\n\nNote that it is good practise to keep the name of the design being tested and the testbench similar. Normally this is done by simply appending _tb or _test to the end of the design name.\n\nNow that we have a blank testbench module to work with, we need to instantiate the design we are going to test.\n\nAs named instantiation is generally easy to maintain than positional instantiation, as well as being easier to understand, this is the method we use.\n\nThe code snippet below shows how we would instantiate the DUT, assuming that the signals clk, in_1, in_b and out_q are declared previously.\n\nThe next thing we do is generate a clock and reset signal in our verilog testbench.\n\nIn both cases, we can write the code for this within an initial block. We then use the verilog delay operator to schedule the changes of state.\n\nIn the case of the clock signal, we use the forever keyword to continually run the clock signal during our tests.\n\nUsing this construct, we schedule an inversion every 1 ns, giving a clock frequency of 500MHz.\n\nThis frequency is chosen purely to give a fast simulation time. In reality, 500MHz clock rates in FPGAs are difficult to achieve and the testbench clock frequency should match the frequency of the hardware clock.\n\nThe verilog code below shows how the clock and the reset signals are generated in our testbench.\n\nThe final part of the testbench that we need to write is the test stimulus.\n\nIn order to test the circuit we need to generate each of the four possible input combinations in turn. We then need to wait for a short time while the signals propagate through our code block.\n\nTo do this, we assign the inputs a value and then use the verilog delay operator to allow for propagation through the FPGA.\n\nWe also want to monitor the values of the inputs and outputs, which we can do with the $monitor verilog system task.\n\nThe code snippet below shows the code for this.\n\nThe verilog code below shows the testbench example in its entirety."

        "document": "Clocks are fundamental to building digital circuits as it allows different blocks to be in sync with each other.\n\nThe key properties of a digital clock are its frequency which determines the clock period, its duty cycle and the clock phase in relation to other clocks.\n\nThe frequency indicates how many cycles can be found in a certain period of time. And hence the clock period is the time taken to complete 1 cycle.\n\nThe amount of time the clock is high compared to its time period defines the duty cycle.\n\nIf one cycle of a clock can be viewed as a complete circle with 360 deg, another clock can be relatively placed at a different place in the circle that occupy a different phase. For example, another clock of the same time period that is shifted to the right by 1/4th of its period can be said to be at 90 deg in phase difference.\n\nSimulations are required to operate on a given timescale that has a limited precision as specified by the timescale directive. Hence it is important that the precision of timescale is good enough to represent a clock period. For example, if the frequency of the clock is set to 640000 kHz, then its clock period will be 1.5625 ns for which a timescale precision of 1ps will not suffice because there is an extra point to be represented. Hence simulation will round off the last digit to fit into the 3 point timescale precision. This will bump up the clock period to 1.563 which actually represents 639795 kHz !\n\nThe following Verilog clock generator module has three parameters to tweak the three different properties as discussed above. The module has an input enable that allows the clock to be disabled and enabled as required. When multiple clocks are controlled by a common enable signal, they can be relatively phased easily.\n\nThe waveform below shows that clocks are stopped when enable is low and clocks are started when enable is set high."

        "document": "A Verilog testbench is a simulation environment used to verify the functionality and correctness of a digital design described in the Verilog hardware description language (HDL).\n\nThe purpose of a testbench is to provide a way to simulate the behavior of the design under various conditions, inputs, and scenarios before actually fabricating the physical hardware. It allows designers to catch bugs, validate functionality, and optimize designs without the cost and time associated with physical prototyping.\n\nDUT or Design Under Test is the Verilog module or design that you want to test. It could be a simple component like an adder or a more complex design like a microprocessor.\n\nThe testbench itself is implemented as a separate top-level Verilog module. This module is responsible for generating input stimuli for the DUT, capturing its output, and comparing it with expected outputs.\n\nThe testbench generates different input patterns and sequences to test different scenarios and edge cases of the design and can be coded using functions and tasks and forms the test stimulus. Some examples are the different input patterns, clock signals, reset signals, and other control signals to test various aspects of the DUT's behavior.\n\nTestbench signals are connected to the ports of the DUT instantiation, and are monitored by different tasks to check design functionality.\n\nNOTE! Testbenches are used only for simulation purposes and not for synthesis. Hence the full range of Verilog constructs like and system tasks like can be used to help with simulation and debug.\n\nLets assume that we want to test the functionality of a latch which is described by the module shown below.\n\nA Verilog testbench can be written by the following steps:\n\nThe latch design contains 3 inputs and 1 output. Inputs are declared of type so that it can be driven from a procedural block such as . Outputs are declared as type so that it is visible in the testbench module and can be monitored to check design behavior.\n\nCreate a module instantiation of the DUT verilog module and connect testbench signals to the DUT ports.\n\nNote that all variables have an uninitialized value of X and can be initialized to some value inside an block.\n\nIt can also be written inside a function which can be called inside the block. Note that functions cannot have simulation delays using operator.\n\nFor our case, we have to release reset and drive some random combination of inputs to see what values the design provides on its output port q for each change in input.\n\nThe checker, depending on the complexity of the design can be written in multiple functions and tasks and called at different points in a simulation. For our purposes of a simple design such as a latch in this example, it can be coded entirely in a single and called just after driving inputs to the design as shown in step 5.\n\nHence by running simulations using the testbench, designers can catch design flaws, validate the functionality of the DUT, and refine the design before moving on to the physical implementation stage. Testbenches are a crucial part of the digital design and verification process, ensuring that the resulting hardware behaves as intended.\n\nSee other examples like 4-bit counter, Full Adder or Single Port RAM !"

However, we will only look at three of the most commonly used verilog system tasks – $display, $monitor and $time.\n\nThe $display function is one of the most commonly used system tasks in verilog. We use this to output a message which is displayed on the console during simulation.\n\nWe use the $display macro in a very similar way to the printf function in C.\n\nThis means we can easily create text statements in our testbench and use them to display information about the status of our simulation.\n\nWe can also use a special character (%) in the string to display signals in our design. When we do this we must also include a format letter which tells the task what format to display the variable in.\n\nThe most commonly used format codes are b (binary), d (decimal) and h (hex). We can also include a number in front of this format code to determine the number of digits to display.\n\nThe verilog code below shows the general syntax for the $display system task. This code snippet also includes an example use case.\n\nThe full list of different formats we can use with the $display system task are shown in the table below.\n\nThe $monitor function is very similar to the $display function, except that it has slightly more intelligent behaviour.\n\nWe use this function to monitor the value of signals in our testbench and display a message whenever one of these signals changes state.\n\nAll system tasks are actually ignored by the synthesizer so we could even include $monitor statements in our verilog RTL code, although this is not common.\n\nThe general syntax for this system task is shown in the code snippet below. This code snippet also includes an example use case.\n\nThe final system task which we commonly use in testbenches is the $time function. We use this system task to get the current simulation time.\n\nIn our verilog testbenches, we commonly use the $time function together with either the $display or $monitor tasks to display the time in our messages.\n\nThe verilog code below shows how we use the $time and $display tasks together to create a message.\n\nNow that we have discussed the most important topics for testbench design, let’s consider a compete example.\n\nWe will use a very simple circuit for this and build a testbench which generates every possible input combination.\n\nThe circuit shown below is the one we will use for this example. This consists of a simple two input and gate as well as a flip flip.\n\nThe first thing we do in the testbench is declare an empty module to write our testbench code in.\n\nThe code snippet below shows the declaration of the module for this testbench.\n\nNote that it is good practise to keep the name of the design being tested and the testbench similar. Normally this is done by simply appending _tb or _test to the end of the design name.\n\nNow that we have a blank testbench module to work with, we need to instantiate the design we are going to test.\n\nAs named instantiation is generally easy to maintain than positional instantiation, as well as being easier to understand, this is the method we use.\n\nThe code snippet below shows how we would instantiate the DUT, assuming that the signals clk, in_1, in_b and out_q are declared previously.\n\nThe next thing we do is generate a clock and reset signal in our verilog testbench.\n\nIn both cases, we can write the code for this within an initial block. We then use the verilog delay operator to schedule the changes of state.\n\nIn the case of the clock signal, we use the forever keyword to continually run the clock signal during our tests.\n\nUsing this construct, we schedule an inversion every 1 ns, giving a clock frequency of 500MHz.\n\nThis frequency is chosen purely to give a fast simulation time. In reality, 500MHz clock rates in FPGAs are difficult to achieve and the testbench clock frequency should match the frequency of the hardware clock.\n\nThe verilog code below shows how the clock and the reset signals are generated in our testbench.\n\nThe final part of the testbench that we need to write is the test stimulus.\n\nIn order to test the circuit we need to generate each of the four possible input combinations in turn. We then need to wait for a short time while the signals propagate through our code block.\n\nTo do this, we assign the inputs a value and then use the verilog delay operator to allow for propagation through the FPGA.\n\nWe also want to monitor the values of the inputs and outputs, which we can do with the $monitor verilog system task.\n\nThe code snippet below shows the code for this.\n\nThe verilog code below shows the testbench example in its entirety."
