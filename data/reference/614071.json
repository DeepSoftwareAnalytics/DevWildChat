        "document": "A great resume can capture the attention of a recruiter or hiring manager and help you stand out from other applicants. When making specific formatting decisions — such as margin size or font style — your goal is to deliver an easily scannable document that allows employers to quickly see why you’re a good fit for the job.\n\nWhat are the most popular resume formats?\n\nThe three most common resume formats are , and . When deciding which resume format you should use, consider your professional history and the role you’re applying for. For example, if you have limited work experience, you might instead focus on academic work, volunteer positions or apprenticeships with a functional resume instead of a chronological resume, which prioritizes job history.\n\nA chronological resume format usually includes the following information in this order:\n\nWhen to use a chronological resume\n\nA chronological resume is a good choice for anyone whose employment history shows a consistent, advancing career path. For example, you might select a chronological resume format if you’ve spent the past several years in the same industry and each role you’ve held was more senior than the last. It’s also often used by people who are applying to a position in the same or similar field to the majority of their work experience.\n\nHowever, if you have multiple gaps in your employment history, you’re looking to change careers or your work experience is heavily varied, you may want to consider a functional or combination resume.\n\nA functional resume format usually includes the following information in this order:\n\nWhen to use a functional resume\n\nIn some cases, a functional resume might be too limiting. If you have some experience and few or no gaps in your employment history, a combination resume might be the right choice.\n\nA combination resume format usually includes the following information in this order:\n\nWhen to use a combination resume\n\nWhy are these the best resume formats?\n\nRecruiters often have to review many resumes for a single open role. They can read a resume in a standard format more easily and thoroughly because they know where to find the information they’re looking for. For example, if a role requires a specific skill, a recruiter will look for it in your skills section listed either above or below your work experience. They have a limited amount of time to spend reviewing each resume, so they may move on and assume you don’t possess the qualification if it takes too long to find the right information.\n\nHere are the key steps for formatting a resume. Let’s look at each of these components in detail. Consider how you might apply each of these when drafting or updating your resume.\n\nHere are several examples of the best resume fonts:\n\nAnother factor in making your words clear and readable is setting an appropriate font size. Generally, you should stay between 10 and 12 points. If you have a shorter resume and are trying to fill space, select a 12-point font. Anything larger might appear unprofessional. If you have a lot of information on your resume, start with a 10-point font and increase it if you have space.\n\nIf your resume is still more than one page with a 10-point font, avoid reducing your font further. Instead, see if there is an opportunity to make your ideas more concise. You can do this by removing any irrelevant or extraneous information, combining ideas or making your ideas briefer with shorter sentences and fewer filler words.\n\nFor example, here’s a sentence in a resume that can be shortened:\n\n“Performed inventory audits every month and discovered issues with over-ordering — executed an organization solution across all teams which resulted in a 10% increase in revenue over the next two quarters.”\n\nMake your ideas concise and remove filler words to include only the core value of your statement:\n\nHere are a few other ways you can use to make a shorter resume:\n• None Consider removing filler words such as and\n• None Instead of listing each function of every job you’ve held, pick 2-3 key impacts you made in those roles.\n• None If you have two similar points, consider combining them into one brief statement.\n\nBolding, underlining or increasing the font size by one or two points for section headers can help employers quickly find the information they are looking for. Be careful when formatting section headers—they should be differentiated from the section body in a clean, professional way. You can stylize your headers in a few different ways:\n• None Use a “bold” font on your section headers.\n• None Increase the size of your section header fonts to 12 or 14 points.\n\nYou can also apply these styles to your name and contact information at the top of your resume. This information should be the first thing employers see, and it should be easy to read and reference.\n\nWhen differentiating section headers, avoid inserting lines that span across the page. Often, when an ATS reads a formatting element like this, errors will occur like scrambled text which can make your resume difficult to decipher.\n\n6. Use bullet points where appropriate\n\nFor example, when describing a role you’ve held in the experience section of your resume, you would use bullets to communicate how you were successful in that role:\n• None Anticipated needs of 11 on-site workers and delivered parts to 23 field technicians\n\nIn the education section, you might not have three or more ideas to share, so it might look something like this without bullet points:\n\nAfter you’ve finished writing and formatting your resume, ask trusted friends or colleagues to review it. It can be helpful to have an outside perspective and feedback. While they should look for grammar and spelling mistakes you might have missed, they should also pay attention to your formatting. Ask them to look for readability, consistency and a professional look and feel.\n\nHere are examples of what a resume might look like following each of the three formats:\n\nThe following is an example of a chronological resume:\n\n\n\nBachelor of Arts in Journalism\n\nTexas State University, Houston, TX\n\nGraduated: May 2013\n• None Plan and direct public relations programs to create a positive public image for ABC Company.\n• None Supported the PR team to ensure all fundraising efforts, local events and other special projects met the organization’s brand guidelines and upheld a favorable public image.\n\nThe following is an example of a functional resume:\n\n\n\nI am skilled in developing and new relationships with prospects and nurturing relationships with existing clients. In previous roles, I used a combination of proficiency in conflict resolution and my ability to build rapport to increase client retention rates as high as 300% year over year.\n\n\n\nI have managed a sales team of more than 10 sales associates at a time, coached and mentored junior sales representatives and regularly lead teams to exceed monthly, quarterly and yearly quotas.\n• None Oversaw regional account list averaging more than 90 existing clients and 40 prospects.\n• None Managed an account list with more than 30 clients including private practices and mid-sized clinics.\n• None Worked to maximize account growth through regular on-site visits, monthly check-ins and quarterly updates.\n• None Increased awareness of Acme Health products to small private practices through on-site education.\n• None Shared information about new medications to help establish relationships with new prospects.\n\nThe following is an example of a combination resume:\n\n\n\nBachelor of Art in Advertising, Certificate in Graphic Design\n\nUniversity of California, San Diego\n\nGraduated: May 2010\n• None Oversee all in-house creative projects and ensure all deliverables meet brand guidelines.\n• None Developed in-house brand style guide currently used by the entire creative department.\n• None Develop visual concepts for web and print design, including websites, mobile sites, digital ads, business cards and trade show collateral.\n• None Coordinate team of creative resources, lead team meetings and offer to mentor as needed.\n• None Manage all aspects of creative projects, including timeline, resource coordination, internal communication and sharing progress reports with outside stakeholders.\n• None Create logos, design brand marks, offer brand color recommendations and create style guides to ensure cohesiveness across all assets.\n\nPlease note that, at the time of this article's writing, the companies, institutions or organizations mentioned in this article may or may not be affiliated with Indeed, and their mention in this article does not imply a business relationship with Indeed."

        "document": "Following the guidelines of a professional resume are pivotal for getting a good job. For any vacancy, recruiters receive a huge number of resumes on an everyday basis. Not every applicant is equipped with great software skills to create a unique professional resume. In such cases, your professionally designed document can help you stand out among your competitors. A great resume offers you the support you need to defeat your competition and land a job that you would love.\n\nSelecting the right format is the first step in designing your resume. The main types of resume formats to choose from include the following:\n• Chronological: This format focuses on professional experience that is listed in reverse chronological order. The majority of resumes follow this format.\n• None Combination: The combination format offers equal space and importance to the work experience and skills sections. Choose a resume format that allows you to depict your most relevant accomplishments and skills in leading positions so that the hiring manager can easily notice them.\n\nIt is important that you select a font that is easy to read. A few fonts that adhere to the resume formatting guidelines and clearly depict your qualifications to the hiring managers include the following:\n\nKeeping your resume short and simple helps your hiring manager easily skim through your qualifications and see if you are worthy enough to be hired. As per professional standards, your resume length should reach 2-3 pages only when you have more than 10 years of experience or if you are submitting a CV or a federal resume.\n\nSelect the Best Size for Resume Margins\n\nThe ideal size for resume margins is between ½” and 1”. When margins are wider than an inch, they create a lot of blank space that can make a resume appear empty.\n\nIt is important that you choose the best font size for your resume so that it is easily readable. Choose the font size to be between 10.5 and 12, ensuring it best fits your page.\n\nPut Your Job Title and Name in the Header\n\nDon’t shy away from highlighting yourself in your resume. Format your name on your resume header and write in big and bold text, and then list your contact information. The font size you use for your contact information should be the same as for the rest of your resume.\n\nIt is important to have an eye-catching resume headline to overcome the tight competition in the job market. The headline or title of your resume should be a 1-2 line phrase that concisely summarizes your qualifications to convince the hiring manager to keep reading your resume.\n\nAdd a bit of color to your resume to make it visually appealing to your hiring manager. You can use a resume template created by a professional designer to make sure that your resume has the right balance of black text, white space, and color. You also need to think about the colors that are right for the job you are applying for. For instance, if you need to target a graphic design position at a budding startup, you might want to consider brighter shades like blue or red. However, if you are applying to work at a company that works in banking, go for neutral or subtle colors.\n\nMention Your Skills in Your Resume Introduction\n\nUnder your resume headline, list your most relevant accomplishments and skills in a brief introduction. A resume introduction includes 2-3 sentences or bullets containing information that motivates the hiring manager to go through all sections of your resume.\n\nDepict your accomplishments in the work experience section of your resume. Present your achievements in 3-4 bullets under every job title. This will help your potential employers understand your capability before they choose to hire you.\n\nUse Numbers to Depict Your Accomplishments\n\nInstead of merely talking about your skills and accomplishments in your resume, support them with hard numbers. Use percentages and specific examples to depict the growth you created. This will prove your credibility and competency to your hiring manager.\n\nPut the name of your educational institution and highest degree in the education section of your resume. In case you don’t have sufficient work experience, you can also list the relevant courses you completed in your resume.\n\nUse a Dedicated Section to Emphasize Your Skills\n\nHighlight your soft and hard skills in a bulleted format under the skills section of your resume. Include any computer skills, foreign language, and certifications related to your job that could benefit your potential employer.\n\nAdd Other Important Information to Stand Out\n\nf you have any extracurricular activities, interests, or volunteer experiences that are relevant to the job you’re looking for, add those to your resume. You can also quantify the hobbies and experience you add with data to ensure that this extra information does not get overlooked.\n\nUse strong adjectives and impressive action verbs to talk about your achievements. Use action words like ‘accomplished’, ‘finalized’, ‘innovated’, etc. to boost the intensity of your resume.\n\nDon’t use pronouns like ‘I’ in your resume. It is beneficial to cut straight to the verb and take the potential employer directly to your qualifications. Thus, instead of saying “I conducted an evaluation of organization’s workflows”, say “Conducted evaluation of organization’s workflows”.\n\nYou need to customize your resume for each job application that you submit. Employers are on the search for candidates who meet the particular requirements that are listed in their job descriptions. When your resume contains information that is irrelevant to a particular employer, you won’t be considered for that job application.\n\nUse the Right Keywords to Pass the ATS\n\nApplicant Tracking Software or ATS automatically filters applications based on specific job-related keywords on your resume. The majority of companies these days use ATS for filtering candidates. Thus, it is important that you use skills based on the job advertisement on your resume to get your document past the ATS to your hiring manager.\n\nProofread your resume thoroughly to ensure it is mistake-free. Mistakes in your resume can give your employers the impression that you are unprofessional or careless. You can also ask someone to go through your resume after you have proofread it. While creating your resume, your brain tends to prioritize meaning over little mistakes like grammatical errors or typos. When someone else reads the information you’ve written, they can easily catch the errors you missed.\n\nPDF files are easy to open in the majority of computer operating systems. When you save your resume as a PDF file, you also remove those bothersome underlines that the Spell Checker of Word places on the terms it does not recognize.\n\nWriting research driven, ATS compliant, and analytically optimized resume is significant for getting a good job. Job portals and recruitment agencies look for resumes that are easily accessible and don’t want to go through the pain of formatting resumes manually. The resume formatting services of Damco helps customize the resume of a candidate into the format preferred by their client. The HR department of an organization needs the resumes of candidates in a certain format. We format resumes according to the guidelines offered by you in the most effective manner."

        "document": "Learning what your resume should look like in 2023 isn’t just a matter of aesthetics.\n\nHiring data shows there’s an average of 200 applicants per job opening. Some researchers say that figure may be closer to 500 candidates, depending on the position.\n\nI share these figures not to scare you, but to highlight your stiff competition.\n\nYour resume is your best chance to make a powerful first impression on hiring teams and recruiters. These decision-makers are inundated with well-qualified applicants as soon as they post a job.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, eye-tracking studies reveal they only spend 7.4 seconds scanning a resume before deciding whether to read it in its entirety or move on to the next one.\n\nThat’s not a lot of time to capture and excite readers about your value.\n\nSo in this post, I’ll highlight exactly what your resume should look like in 2023 to stand out, engage readers, and boost your chances of landing an interview.\n\nWhat Your Resume Should Look Like In 2023: 5 Must-Haves + Examples\n\nAn attractive, high-performing resume immediately piques a reader’s interest. It subtly draws them down the page to learn why you’re the candidate they’re looking for.\n\nSo every resume in 2023 should incorporate these five elements to achieve that goal:\n\nA traditional resume format (think: chronological order, bullet points, etc.) won’t give you a leg-up on your competition in 2023. Using one may even hold you back.\n\nSee, hiring managers tune out when one of those stale resume templates lands on their desks for the umpteenth time. These boring resumes don’t excite or connect with readers. So your resume could be passed over in that brief 7.4-second scan before it’s even read.\n\nThat’s why it’s so important to freshen up the look of your resume with an updated, modern resume template like this one:\n\nWant to use this resume template? Click this link purchase it and start customizing this template (or any others in this article) now.\n\nUnlike a traditional resume template, the one above builds a personal connection with readers by introducing and showcasing your value first. A quick scan of the top half provides them with a snapshot of your areas of expertise and core competencies, two very attractive “hooks” to hiring teams.\n\nReaders will then feel compelled to learn where you honed those skills. So the bottom half of this resume template helps organize your career achievements in an engaging, eye-appealing way.\n\nRather than reading like a bland job description, each point should back up your skill set while proving your track record of success.\n\nAnyone reading your resume formatted with a modern template like this will know precisely who you are and the value you’ll deliver, which is the ultimate goal.\n\n2. Clear Sections To Highlight Your Best Features\n\nResumes that look like one giant block of text are intimidating. They tell hiring teams they’ll need to spend time and effort to mine for the intel they’re looking for. And with hundreds of other resumes vying for their attention, they’ll probably just pass on doing so.\n\nThat’s why most modern resume templates are divided into sections with clear, distinct headers. This makes your resume easier to scan and read, not to mention far more enjoyable for busy hiring managers.\n\nThe resume template above does a fantastic job of breaking up a resume into bite-sized chunks of information. The example below takes this concept a step further:\n\nThe highlights and expertise section in this resume template sits in a blue box to draw the reader’s eyes and attention. This is like telling hiring teams, “Hey! Come check this out!”\n\nSo think of your resume as a cheat sheet for hiring managers and recruiters rather than a dossier.\n\nYour resume headings and sections will create an organized outline of your qualifications. Then these call-out boxes can be used to show off your best features, as they’re likely one of the first things hiring managers will notice during their initial scan.\n\nOften times, candidates are so focused on adding every little detail to their resume that it becomes too crammed to read. Headings and call-out boxes can help with this problem. But nothing works quite as well as more white space.\n\nWhite space, or the places in your resume without words or formatting, adds breathing room to your resume. It prevents a resume from appearing jam-packed and hard to read.\n\nA resume with well-defined sections naturally creates more white space, like this resume template:\n\nAim for short copy to add more white space to your resume. Break up any big chunks of text to make reading less overwhelming and easier for the eyes.\n\nYour resume is like a garden. You don’t want wordy sentences hiding your highlights and achievements like weeds overrunning a beautiful flower bed.\n\nPrune your copy, and you’ll easily add more white space to your resume and draw attention to your best selling points simultaneously.\n\nIf you really want to stand out and catch someone’s attention, a pop of bold color on your resume is a must. But this doesn’t mean you should haphazardly throw a rainbow of color wherever you want.\n\nWhen done strategically, as this example does, color can be used to add emphasis, contrast, and personality. It can also help break up the sea of black text on your resume.\n\nWant to use this resume template? Click this link to customize this template or any others in this article now.\n\nThough a pop of color can help your resume stand out and make a memorable first impression, colors that are too bright or off-putting will do so for the wrong reasons. Opt for deeper, saturated shades, so your resume will be legible in person and on-screen.\n\nIt’s essential to think about the font you choose for your resume.\n\nAnything “cutesy” will likely be regarded as unprofessional. Likewise, a font that’s too light or too bold may also be difficult to read.\n\nThe best fonts to use on a resume include Serif and Sans Serif fonts, such as Times New Roman, Georgia, Verdana, and Arial.\n\nAs for the font size, stick to 10-14 points (10-12 for regular text and 12-14 for headings and subheadings).\n\nThis template offers a great example of resume text formatting:\n\nOn a similar note, be sure to emphasize the right areas, not everything. Only use bold or italics to draw attention to your top achievements, companies you’ve worked for, and other notable points according to the role.\n\nNow that you know the must-have ingredients for a high-performing resume, it’s time to put these tips to good use.\n\nIncorporating today’s must-have elements will give your resume a fresh upgrade for 2023 and help you connect with hiring teams and recruiters.\n\nIf you use one of the resume templates shared in this guide, you’ll ace this task in half the time. Just purchase and download the one that fits your needs best, plug in your information where prompted, and voila!\n\nYou’ll have a modern, professional resume ready to send out in a matter of minutes instead of spending all day reformatting your current one.\n\nClick this link to learn more about the resume templates featured in this article.\n\nPsst!

        "document": "In the competitive world of technology, crafting a CV that stands out is crucial.\n\nWhether you're a developer, an IT manager, or another tech professional, a well-structured CV can significantly impact your job search success.\n\nThis guide provides expert advice on creating a CV tailored for technical roles, ensuring you highlight your strengths and achievements effectively.\n\nYour personal profile is the first thing recruiters see, so it needs to be compelling and to the point. For tech professionals, this means highlighting your technical expertise, experience, and career aspirations succinctly.\n\nStart with a brief introduction of your current role and overall experience. Mention specific technologies and methodologies you excel in, such as Agile, DevOps, or specific programming languages like Python or Java.\n\nFor example, \"Experienced IT Manager with over 10 years in the industry, specialising in cloud solutions and cybersecurity. Proven track record of leading teams to deliver complex projects on time and within budget, with expertise in AWS, Azure, and network security protocols.\"\n\nIf you have notable achievements, such as leading a successful project or significantly improving a system's performance, include these to grab attention.\n\nIn the tech industry, specific skills can make or break your chances of landing a job. Therefore, your skills section should be prominent and detailed. Instead of a simple list, consider breaking your skills into categories to provide a clearer picture of your capabilities.\n\nDivide your skills into sections such as \"Programming Languages,\" \"Frameworks and Libraries,\" \"Tools and Platforms,\" and \"Soft Skills\" so they’re easy for recruiters and hiring managers to spot.\n\nFor each category, list your proficiencies in order of relevance to the job you are applying for. For instance, under \"Programming Languages,\" you might list Python, Java, C++, and SQL, if these are pertinent to the role.\n\nIn addition to technical skills, highlight soft skills like problem-solving, teamwork, and communication, which are crucial for collaborative environments.\n\nRather than just listing job duties, focus on what you have achieved in your previous roles, such as steering a technical project or implementing a systems improvement. This demonstrates your ability to apply your skills effectively and make a tangible impact.\n\nYou should also use quantifiable metrics to illustrate your successes, for example, instead of saying, \"Developed and maintained the company website,\" say, \"Led the development and maintenance of the company website, resulting in a 50% increase in user engagement and a 30% decrease in loading times through optimised coding practices and server improvements.\"\n\nWhen describing your achievements, use action verbs such as \"engineered,\" \"implemented,\" \"optimised,\" and \"led.\" This makes your CV more dynamic and engaging.\n\nIn the tech industry, certifications and memberships in professional organisations can significantly enhance your CV. They demonstrate your commitment to continuous learning and professional development.\n\nInclude any relevant certifications, such as CompTIA Security+, AWS Certified Solutions Architect, or Cisco's CCNA.\n\nMentioning these qualifications not only highlights your expertise but also your dedication to staying current with industry standards.\n\nAdditionally, memberships in professional bodies like the British Computer Society (BCS) or the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) can add weight to your CV.\n\nThese affiliations can provide networking opportunities and access to industry resources, further showcasing your commitment to your field.\n\nTailor your CV to each role\n\nOne of the most important aspects of writing a winning CV is tailoring it to each job you apply for. This means customising your CV to highlight the skills and experiences that are most relevant to the specific role and company.\n\nStart by carefully reading the job description and noting the key requirements. Adjust your personal profile, skills section, and achievements to mirror the language and priorities of the job posting.\n\nThis not only helps your CV pass through Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) but also shows recruiters that you have taken the time to understand the role and align your application accordingly.\n\nFor instance, if the job requires expertise in data analytics and cloud computing, ensure these skills are prominently featured in your CV, and provide examples of how you have utilised them in your previous roles.\n\nCreating a CV for the tech industry requires attention to detail and a strategic approach.\n\nBy writing a compelling personal profile, highlighting your skills, focusing on your technical achievements, showcasing relevant memberships and qualifications, and tailoring your CV to each role, you can significantly increase your chances of standing out in the competitive tech job market.\n\nApproach your CV as a tool to market yourself effectively, and ensure every section works towards presenting you as the ideal candidate for the role.\n\nWith a well-crafted CV, you will be well on your way to securing your next opportunity in the tech industry."

So it's natural once you get to the application stage, you'll want to use that CV as much as possible.\n\nSadly, this doesn't always work and may earn you many rejections.\n\nWhy you should customize your CV?\n\nSending the same core CV out to every role that you apply to doesn't work for a few reasons.\n• Doesn't fit the job description: You want to make it easy for a recruiter or hiring manager to see you in the role. And you only have your CV initially to communicate this. Your CV may share precisely what you'd like to be known for, but that may not be what the employer wants.\n• Misses out on keywords: Hiring managers and recruiters alike may scan (or use a tool like an ATS) to scan CVs for keywords related to the job description. If your core CV misses out on these, it may not reach the following hiring stage.\n• Inconsistent messaging: Your core CV may be built for a specific kind of role or position, and any variation on that will render your CV incompatible. It doesn't look great if you're applying to a QA engineer position when your CV reflects more of a programming background.\n\nHow to customize your CV for tech jobs quickly\n\nSo what can you do to customize your CV per application (relatively) quickly?\n• Match your experiences to the role description: You might consider tailoring your work descriptions to fit the tasks and responsibilities in the job description. Review the job description carefully and try to identify commonalities between what they're looking for and your experience. For example, if a role requires project management, mention and highlight project management experience in your listed work experience.\n• Change your mission statement to reflect the role you're applying for: This is of the easiest ways for employers to identify you as relevant for their open position. For example, if you are a recent graduate with basic frontend skills applying to your first frontend development position, you might consider adding a title below your name as \"Aspiring frontend developer.\" Or, if you were a graphic designer and transitioning to a career in UX/UI, you might consider concisely detailing your desire to apply your keen eye for visuals to the product design space.\n• Consider creating multiple CVs: If you're applying to multiple kinds of roles (like graphic design roles and UX/UI roles), consider creating multiple CVs that you can keep on file. This way, you can pull out the most relevant one and customize only the basics when it comes time to hit apply.\n\n\n\nAre you new to mission statements? Consider checking out a few examples of mission statements for CVs here.\n\n2. Overloading your CV for tech jobs with technical language\n\nWhen you're starting, you'll want to sound like a professional. And while you'll want to drop the \"ums,\" \"maybes,\" and \"whatevers,\" it's easy to switch to overly technical language.\n\nRemember, not everyone looking at your CV will be a technical expert. Definitely include core tools and programming languages you've worked with. But avoid dropping concepts like blockchain, APIs, machine learning, or quantum computing on every other line.\n\n\n\nUse your technical language selectively and when it supports your professional story and matches the job description.\n\nHow can you keep your CV easy to read?\n\nSimple: try reading your CV out loud. If there are words that don't roll off the tongue, words you find difficult to pronounce, or sentences you couldn't imagine saying out loud, it may be a good indicator that they're not right for your CV. Try simplifying your language. Otherwise, you could find yourself in an awkward position when asked about specific items on your CV.\n\nOne of the most common mistakes Re:Coded's Career team sees with first-time tech professionals is formatting. Even if the content is excellent, if the presentation falls short, it may not get read.\n\nWhat do we mean by poor formatting? Here are a few examples of bad CVs, many of them a result of formatting. But as some general guidance, look out for the following:\n• Too much color: Adding more than one color can be a real risk, especially if they clash. If you feel you must add color, stick to something muted and consider the audience that you'll be sending this out to.\n• Tight margins: If you have a lot of experience, it can be tough to choose just a few. But avoid making the margins smaller to fit more content. Stick to at least 0.5 cm on all sides.\n• Not enough space between paragraphs or lines: Similar to the margins, avoid crowding your lines together. Stick to at least single spacing.\n• Too many design elements: You only have a limited amount of space, avoid adding too many design elements like icons or backgrounds. These can distract from your overall message.\n\nThere are lots of ways to format your CV. The Harvard CV is a solid foundation, even though it definitely is on the plain side of things. Alternatively, Canva has many CV templates but use these cautiously, observing all of the warnings above— and remember, don't go too crazy on the design.\n\nIf you're new to tech, it's great to highlight your newfound technical skills. But technical skills are not the only thing hiring managers are looking for.\n\nWhat soft skills do hiring managers look for?\n\nMany managers are looking for critical soft skills besides your tech skills (which is why every Re:Coded bootcamp takes the time to teach soft skills, too).\n\nHere are some core soft skills for tech professionals:\n• Communication: Tech professionals need strong communication skills to convey ideas effectively, explain technical concepts, and collaborate with team members, stakeholders, and clients.\n• Problem-solving: Problem-solving is at the core of much tech work. You'll need to analyze complex issues, break them into manageable parts, and develop effective solutions.\n• Adaptability: The technology field is constantly evolving, and tech professionals must be adaptable to keep up with new tools, languages, frameworks, and methodologies. They need to embrace change and quickly learn new skills.\n• Teamwork: Tech professionals rarely work entirely alone. That means you'll collaborate with other developers, designers, project managers, and stakeholders. The ability to work well in a team, contribute ideas, and resolve conflicts is crucial.\n• Time management: In tech, you'll frequently work on multiple projects with competing deadlines. Effective time management skills helps prioritize tasks, meet deadlines, and maintain productivity.\n• Attention to detail: In many tech roles, even a small error can lead to significant issues. Attention to detail is crucial.\n• Creativity: While many tech roles require logical thinking, creativity is also valuable. Tech professionals who can think outside the box and develop innovative solutions tend to excel.\n• Growth mindset: Technology is ever-evolving, and you'll need a constant desire to learn and improve your skills. They should be open to new ideas, seek out learning opportunities, and stay up to date with industry trends.\n• Empathy: Understanding end-users needs and experiences is important for anyone working in tech. Empathy helps you design user-friendly solutions that truly meet user requirements.\n\nMake sure to work a few of these skills into your work experience section instead of exclusively focusing on your technical skills.\n\nIt's easy to misunderstand that your CV should be a chronological record of where you've worked. But it's more about what you've done, rather than where you've been. Hiring managers will look for how you've contributed to the success of previous organizations and teams. \n\n\n\nWhat kind of achievements can you add to your CV?\n• Completed projects: Highlight any projects you've completed, whether as part of your academic coursework, personal projects, or internships. Include details about the project's goals, your role, the technologies used, and the outcomes achieved.\n• Contributions to team projects: If you've collaborated on team projects, mention specific contributions you made that had a positive impact on the project's success. For example, mention if you introduced an innovative idea, solved a challenging problem, or implemented a crucial feature.\n• Technical skills development: Showcase your efforts in learning and developing technical skills. This can include completing online courses, certifications, or workshops related to programming languages, frameworks, or tools. Mention any notable achievements or projects completed during these learning experiences.\n• Troubleshooting and bug fixing: For more technical roles, highlight instances where you successfully identified and resolved technical issues or bugs in software or systems. This demonstrates your problem-solving skills and attention to detail.\n• Process improvements: If you've contributed to improving development processes or workflows, mention it on your CV. For example, if you implemented a more efficient method for code review, version control, or testing, that resulted in time or cost savings.\n• Collaboration and communication: Showcase examples of your effective collaboration and communication skills within a team. If you facilitated productive discussions, actively contributed ideas, or helped resolve conflicts, mention these experiences as they demonstrate your ability to work well with others.\n• Positive feedback or recognition: If you've received positive feedback or recognition from colleagues, clients, or supervisors, include it on your CV. This can be in testimonials, performance evaluations, or appreciation emails.\n• Participation in tech communities: If you're actively engaged with the tech community, such as contributing to open-source projects, attending meetups or conferences, or participating in hackathons, mention these experiences. They highlight your enthusiasm and dedication to the field.\n\nIf you look at that list, we're sure there will be something there for you that you can point to on your CV. Remember to keep the experiences relevant to the roles you are applying to.\n\nWe've talked a lot about including the most relevant experience for the job. And while you should 100% do that, there's one exception to the rule: past careers.\n\nAt Re:Coded, we have a lot of students who transition from careers as salespeople, nurses, or architects (for example) to careers in tech. And when it comes to putting together a CV, many hesitate:\n\nWhat do I include on my CV if I've never worked in tech?\n\nLet's get rid of this misconception once and for all: just because your past work experience wasn't in tech doesn't mean that it's not relevant to a career in tech. Your past experiences tell a story and may demonstrate transferable skills.\n\nHow do you include past non-tech experience on your tech CV?\n• Bio or mission statement: Include a mention of your previous career and (briefly) some of the applicable lessons you learned that you'd be bringing with you into the tech industry. Focus on essential skills that are shared between your past career and your new tech career.\n• Work experience: Depending on the space you have on your CV, you can consider adding a consolidated (one item) summary of the work experience from your previous career. Remember to focus on accomplishments or responsibilities that share some similarity to your future career goals.\n• Skills: Focus on the transferable skills that you acquired in your previous career and, space allowing, briefly detail applications to your future tech career.\n• Highlight continuous learning: Switching careers require reskilling, and your CV is the perfect opportunity to demonstrate this. Make sure to include where and how you reskilled to a career in tech.\n\nLet's take a moment to remind you that crafting an outstanding CV is like coding a masterpiece—it takes time, effort, and a sprinkle of creativity. If you're feeling discouraged or uncertain, remember that every tech rockstar started somewhere. And practice is the key to success.\n\nDon't lose hope. Take this opportunity to refine your CV, showcasing your skills, passion, and potential. And trust us, that perfect opportunity will come knocking, and when it does, you'll be armed with a stellar CV that shines like a bug-free code."

        "document": "Performing any job requires the use of multiple skill sets. Many jobs require skills related to physical or digital tools—these are often called \"technical skills.\" Technical skills can vary widely across industries and jobs.\n\nIn this article, we explore the variety of technical skills you might need in your career path, as well as how to improve them.\n• None Technical skills, or hard skills, are abilities used for specific tasks and are crucial in various industries, from IT and mechanics to retail and foodservice, where tools like POS software are needed.\n• None Nearly every job requires specific tools, programs, or processes, and possessing industry-relevant technical knowledge makes you a more competitive candidate.\n• None Employers typically seek a mix of \"required\" skills essential for job performance and \"desired\" skills that are preferable but not mandatory, with the latter often being developed on the job if needed.\n\nTraditionally, people working in mathematics, computer science, mechanics and information technology have used many technical skills. Today, many more industries rely on employees with technical knowledge. For example, retail and foodservice workers often need to know how to use point-of-sale (POS) software.\n\nSome specific examples of technical skills might include:\n\nTechnical skills vary widely between industry and job type. For computer programmers, knowledge of various coding languages is considered a technical skill. Customer service representatives may need technical skills relating to customer management and telephone systems.\n\nTechnical skills are important because nearly every job relies on different tools, programs and processes. If you have sought-after technical knowledge common in your industry, you’ll be a more competitive candidate.\n\nWhat skills are employers looking for?\n\nWhen employers post jobs, they often include lists of both “required” and “desired” technical skills.\n\n\"Required\" skills are prerequisites for job success; for instance, a chef must have basic cooking skills. While some companies offer on-the-job training, others may hire experienced chefs who only need training on new recipes.\n\n\"Desired\" skills are preferred but not required, and employers may hire candidates without them, offering on-the-job training if needed. This is common for roles with high turnover or specialized tools that are hard to master before employment.\n\nThe type of technical skills you may be required to know will depend on the job you’re seeking. Here are a few examples of different technical skills you may see listed on job posts:\n\nIn addition to software engineers, there are many jobs today that require programming knowledge. If you’re looking for a job as a writer, for example, you may be required to have some basic knowledge of HTML.\n\nMost industries use both common and specialized software. This often includes what’s known as “productivity software,” or software designed to help get work done faster and more efficiently. Most commonly, this includes word processing, spreadsheet and presentation software.\n\nBecause these software applications are so prevalent and often a basic requirement of many jobs, you may not need to list any individually on your resume—unless you know specific aspects of these programs. For example, instead of listing , you could be more specific and name a function like\n\nTechnical skills vary by industry, so research job postings to identify common skills and highlight those you have on your resume. Consider prioritizing them.\n\nHere are a few examples of position-specific technical skills you may find on job postings:\n\nHow to improve your technical skills\n\nIf you’re changing industries or positions, you may need to consider improving on or acquiring new abilities. There are several steps you can take to improve your technical skills.\n\n1. Enroll in courses for different skills\n\nMost technical skills can be learned through a dedicated training program or class. Depending on the type of skill, you may be able to learn that skill by taking one or more courses, either online or in person. There are free and paid classes available online.\n\nThere’s a chance you may be able to acquire different skills through self-study programs. That could include “how-to” books, self-paced online lessons, or free training materials available from different sources.\n\nYou may be able to locate a professional who already possesses the technical skills you want. If so, that individual may be able to help teach you the skills you’re looking for, either for free or for compensation.\n\nSome employers may be able to provide on-the-job training. If you do not have certain technical skills an employer desires, make it known that you are eager to learn whatever skills are necessary to effectively perform the job.\n\nHow to include technical skills on your resume\n\nWhen applying for jobs, you can use both your resume and cover letter to highlight your most important and relevant technical skills employers may find valuable.\n\nYour resume should feature a skills section with 10-30 relevant soft and hard skills, prioritizing technical skills that align with the job you're applying for. Try to have your technical skills account for at least half of your skills section.\n\nFor some jobs, you may want to avoid listing the most common technical skills that the potential employer would assume every applicant already has (such as proficiency in an email platform, for example).\n\nHow to keep your technical skills current\n\nUnlike soft skills, technical skills change with time. Once you’ve successfully landed a job, it can be helpful to keep your technical skills active. Engaging in continuing education can help you stay ahead as tools and programs change. Staying proactive with your skills ensures you don't fall behind in your field.\n\nKeep your resume updated as you gain new technical skills or enhance the ones you currently possess. Whether you’re in a technical field or in skilled labor, employers want workers who have the skills required to get the job done efficiently and successfully.\n\nThe model shown is for illustration purposes only, and may require additional formatting to meet accepted standards.\n\nPlease note that, at the time of this article's writing, the companies, institutions or organizations mentioned in this article may or may not be affiliated with Indeed, and their mention in this article does not imply a business relationship with Indeed."
