The value may be any valid . The default value is a solid outline. The starting offset in pixels into the pattern provided by the dash option. dashoffset is ignored if there is no dash pattern. The offset may have any of the forms described in the section below. The default value is 0. Specifies the size of the angular range occupied by the arc. The arc’s range extends for the given number of degrees counter-clockwise from the starting angle given by the start option. The value may be negative. If it is greater than 360 or less than -360, then degrees modulo 360 is used as the extent. The default value is 90. Specifies the colour to be used to fill arc’s area in its normal, active and disabled states (correspondingly). The given value may be any valid . If the value is an empty string, then the arc will not be filled (i.e. it will be transparent). The default value is an empty string. Specifies the offset of stipples. The offset value can be of the form or side, where side can be n, ne, e, se, s, sw, w, nw, or center. In the first case, the origin is the origin of the canvas itself, but putting # in front of the coordinate pair indicates using the current window’s origin instead. The default value is .

A Python tuple of cannot be given and instead must be manually formatted to string of the correct format ( or ). These options specifies the colour that should be used to draw the outline of the arc in its normal, active and disabled states (correspondingly). The given value may be any valid . If colour is specified as an empty string then no outline is drawn for the arc. The default values are as follows: Specifies the offset of the stipple pattern used for outlines, in the same way that the offset option controls fill stipples. See the offset option for a description of acceptable values. The default value is . This option specifies stipple patterns that should be used to draw the outline of the arc in its normal, active and disabled states (correspondingly). It indicates that the outline for the arc should be drawn with a stipple pattern and specifies the stipple pattern to use. The given value may be any valid .

The default value is an empty string. Stipples are not well supported on platforms other than Unix. Specifies the beginning of the angular range occupied by the arc. The value is given in degrees measured counter-clockwise from the 3-o’clock position; it may be either positive or negative. The default value is 0. This allows the arc to override the canvas widget’s global state option. It takes the same values: normal, disabled or hidden. An empty string will defer to the canvas widget’s state. The default value is an empty string. Specifies how to draw the arc. If type is pieslice then the arc’s region is defined by a section of the oval’s perimeter plus two lines between the center of the oval and each end of the perimeter section. If type is chord then the arc’s region is defined by a section of the oval’s perimeter plus a single line connecting the two end points of the perimeter section. If type is arc then the arc’s region consists of a section of the perimeter alone. In this last case the fill option is ignored. The default value is pieslice.

When requested to draw an arrowhead, Tk internally adjusts the corresponding line end point so that the rendered line ends at the neck of the arrowhead rather than at its tip so that the line doesn’t extend past the edge of the arrowhead. This may trigger a Leave event if the mouse is hovering this line end (see the Enter event. The default value is none.

Conversely, when removing an arrowhead Tk adjusts the corresponding line point the other way round, which may trigger anevent. The default value is l1 in the diagram). The second element gives the distance along the line from the trailing points of the arrowhead to the tip (l2), and the third element gives the distance from the outside edge of the line to the trailing points (l3). The default value is . This option indicates how to draw arrowheads. The shape argument must be a tuple / list with three elements, each specifying a distance in any of the forms described in the section below. The first element of the list gives the distance along the line from the neck of the arrowhead to its tip (in the diagram). The second element gives the distance along the line from the trailing points of the arrowhead to the tip (), and the third element gives the distance from the outside edge of the line to the trailing points (). The default value is Specifies the ways in which caps are to be drawn at the endpoints of the line. The value may be any of butt, projecting, or round.

The default values are as follows: Specifies the ways in which joints are to be drawn at the vertices of the line (only applicable if more than 2 coordinates are given). The value may be any of bevel, miter, or round. The default value is round. This value must either be a boolean or a line smoothing method. The line should be drawn as a curve, rendered as a set of quadratic splines: one spline is drawn for the first and second line segments, one for the second and third, and so on. Straight-line segments can be generated within a curve by duplicating the end-points of the desired line segment. The line should also be drawn as a curve but where the list of coordinates is such that the first coordinate pair (and every third coordinate pair thereafter) is a knot point on a cubic Bezier curve, and the other coordinates are control points on the cubic Bezier curve. Straight line segments can be generated within a curve by making control points equal to their neighbouring knot points. If the last point is a control point and not a knot point, the point is repeated (one or two times) so that it also becomes a knot point. The default value is . Specifies the degree of smoothness desired for curves: each spline will be approximated with number line segments. This option is ignored if the smooth option is or an empty string. The default value is 12. This option specifies stipple patterns that should be used to fill the line in its normal, active and disabled states (correspondingly). The given value may be any valid . If the fill option is an empty string, then this option has no effect. If the value is an empty string, then filling is done in a solid fashion. The default value is an empty string.

It seems to me that the latter is the case. If I want to make a program that draws many lines based on a given set of coordinates, I would seemingly have to calculate if every given segment is a positive or negative slope before creating it.\n\nI have had to put the program I'm making on a complete hold for several days because of this.

        "document": "This module provides access to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard.\n\nThese functions cannot be used with complex numbers; use the functions of the same name from the module if you require support for complex numbers. The distinction between functions which support complex numbers and those which don’t is made since most users do not want to learn quite as much mathematics as required to understand complex numbers. Receiving an exception instead of a complex result allows earlier detection of the unexpected complex number used as a parameter, so that the programmer can determine how and why it was generated in the first place.\n\nThe following functions are provided by this module. Except when explicitly noted otherwise, all return values are floats.\n\nReturn the number of ways to choose k items from n items without repetition and without order. Evaluates to when and evaluates to zero when . Also called the binomial coefficient because it is equivalent to the coefficient of k-th term in polynomial expansion of . Raises if either of the arguments are not integers. Raises if either of the arguments are negative. Return n factorial as an integer. Raises if n is not integral or is negative. Changed in version 3.10: Floats with integral values (like ) are no longer accepted. Return the greatest common divisor of the specified integer arguments. If any of the arguments is nonzero, then the returned value is the largest positive integer that is a divisor of all arguments. If all arguments are zero, then the returned value is . without arguments returns . Changed in version 3.9: Added support for an arbitrary number of arguments. Formerly, only two arguments were supported. Return the integer square root of the nonnegative integer n. This is the floor of the exact square root of n, or equivalently the greatest integer a such that a² ≤ n. For some applications, it may be more convenient to have the least integer a such that n ≤ a², or in other words the ceiling of the exact square root of n. For positive n, this can be computed using . Return the least common multiple of the specified integer arguments. If all arguments are nonzero, then the returned value is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of all arguments. If any of the arguments is zero, then the returned value is . without arguments returns . Return the number of ways to choose k items from n items without repetition and with order. Evaluates to when and evaluates to zero when . If k is not specified or is , then k defaults to n and the function returns . Raises if either of the arguments are not integers. Raises if either of the arguments are negative.\n\nReturn the ceiling of x, the smallest integer greater than or equal to x. If x is not a float, delegates to , which should return an value. Return the absolute value of x. Return the floor of x, the largest integer less than or equal to x. If x is not a float, delegates to , which should return an value. Fused multiply-add operation. Return , computed as though with infinite precision and range followed by a single round to the format. This operation often provides better accuracy than the direct expression . This function follows the specification of the fusedMultiplyAdd operation described in the IEEE 754 standard. The standard leaves one case implementation-defined, namely the result of and . In these cases, returns a NaN, and does not raise any exception. Return the floating-point remainder of , as defined by the platform C library function . Note that the Python expression may not return the same result. The intent of the C standard is that be exactly (mathematically; to infinite precision) equal to for some integer n such that the result has the same sign as x and magnitude less than . Python’s returns a result with the sign of y instead, and may not be exactly computable for float arguments. For example, is , but the result of Python’s is , which cannot be represented exactly as a float, and rounds to the surprising . For this reason, function is generally preferred when working with floats, while Python’s is preferred when working with integers. Return the fractional and integer parts of x. Both results carry the sign of x and are floats. Note that has a different call/return pattern than its C equivalents: it takes a single argument and return a pair of values, rather than returning its second return value through an ‘output parameter’ (there is no such thing in Python). Return the IEEE 754-style remainder of x with respect to y. For finite x and finite nonzero y, this is the difference , where is the closest integer to the exact value of the quotient . If is exactly halfway between two consecutive integers, the nearest even integer is used for . The remainder thus always satisfies . Special cases follow IEEE 754: in particular, is x for any finite x, and and raise for any non-NaN x. If the result of the remainder operation is zero, that zero will have the same sign as x. On platforms using IEEE 754 binary floating point, the result of this operation is always exactly representable: no rounding error is introduced. Return x with the fractional part removed, leaving the integer part. This rounds toward 0: is equivalent to for positive x, and equivalent to for negative x. If x is not a float, delegates to , which should return an value. For the , , and functions, note that all floating-point numbers of sufficiently large magnitude are exact integers. Python floats typically carry no more than 53 bits of precision (the same as the platform C double type), in which case any float x with necessarily has no fractional bits.\n\nReturn a float with the magnitude (absolute value) of x but the sign of y. On platforms that support signed zeros, returns -1.0. Return the mantissa and exponent of x as the pair . m is a float and e is an integer such that exactly. If x is zero, returns , otherwise . This is used to “pick apart” the internal representation of a float in a portable way. Note that has a different call/return pattern than its C equivalents: it takes a single argument and return a pair of values, rather than returning its second return value through an ‘output parameter’ (there is no such thing in Python). Return if the values a and b are close to each other and otherwise. Whether or not two values are considered close is determined according to given absolute and relative tolerances. If no errors occur, the result will be: . rel_tol is the relative tolerance – it is the maximum allowed difference between a and b, relative to the larger absolute value of a or b. For example, to set a tolerance of 5%, pass . The default tolerance is , which assures that the two values are the same within about 9 decimal digits. rel_tol must be nonnegative and less than . abs_tol is the absolute tolerance; it defaults to and it must be nonnegative. When comparing to , is computed as , which is for any nonzero and rel_tol less than . So add an appropriate positive abs_tol argument to the call. The IEEE 754 special values of , , and will be handled according to IEEE rules. Specifically, is not considered close to any other value, including . and are only considered close to themselves. Return if x is neither an infinity nor a NaN, and otherwise. (Note that is considered finite.) Return if x is a positive or negative infinity, and otherwise. Return if x is a NaN (not a number), and otherwise. Return . This is essentially the inverse of function . Return the floating-point value steps steps after x towards y. If x is equal to y, return y, unless steps is zero.\n• None goes up: towards positive infinity.\n• None goes down: towards minus infinity.\n• None goes towards zero.\n• None goes away from zero. Return the value of the least significant bit of the float x:\n• None If x is a NaN (not a number), return x.\n• None If x is equal to zero, return the smallest positive denormalized representable float (smaller than the minimum positive normalized float, ).\n• None If x is equal to the largest positive representable float, return the value of the least significant bit of x, such that the first float smaller than x is .\n• None Otherwise (x is a positive finite number), return the value of the least significant bit of x, such that the first float bigger than x is . ULP stands for “Unit in the Last Place”. See also and .\n\nReturn e raised to the power x, where e = 2.718281… is the base of natural logarithms. This is usually more accurate than or . Return e raised to the power x, minus 1. Here e is the base of natural logarithms. For small floats x, the subtraction in can result in a significant loss of precision; the function provides a way to compute this quantity to full precision: With one argument, return the natural logarithm of x (to base e). With two arguments, return the logarithm of x to the given base, calculated as . Return the natural logarithm of 1+x (base e). The result is calculated in a way which is accurate for x near zero. Return the base-2 logarithm of x. This is usually more accurate than . returns the number of bits necessary to represent an integer in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros. Return the base-10 logarithm of x. This is usually more accurate than . Return x raised to the power y. Exceptional cases follow the IEEE 754 standard as far as possible. In particular, and always return , even when x is a zero or a NaN. If both x and y are finite, x is negative, and y is not an integer then is undefined, and raises . Unlike the built-in operator, converts both its arguments to type . Use or the built-in function for computing exact integer powers. Changed in version 3.11: The special cases and were changed to return instead of raising , for consistency with IEEE 754.\n\nReturn the Euclidean distance between two points p and q, each given as a sequence (or iterable) of coordinates. The two points must have the same dimension. Return an accurate floating-point sum of values in the iterable. Avoids loss of precision by tracking multiple intermediate partial sums. The algorithm’s accuracy depends on IEEE-754 arithmetic guarantees and the typical case where the rounding mode is half-even. On some non-Windows builds, the underlying C library uses extended precision addition and may occasionally double-round an intermediate sum causing it to be off in its least significant bit. For further discussion and two alternative approaches, see the ASPN cookbook recipes for accurate floating-point summation. Return the Euclidean norm, . This is the length of the vector from the origin to the point given by the coordinates. For a two dimensional point , this is equivalent to computing the hypotenuse of a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem, . Changed in version 3.8: Added support for n-dimensional points. Formerly, only the two dimensional case was supported. Changed in version 3.10: Improved the algorithm’s accuracy so that the maximum error is under 1 ulp (unit in the last place). More typically, the result is almost always correctly rounded to within 1/2 ulp. Calculate the product of all the elements in the input iterable. The default start value for the product is . When the iterable is empty, return the start value. This function is intended specifically for use with numeric values and may reject non-numeric types. Return the sum of products of values from two iterables p and q. Raises if the inputs do not have the same length. For float and mixed int/float inputs, the intermediate products and sums are computed with extended precision.\n\nThe mathematical constant π = 3.141592…, to available precision. The mathematical constant e = 2.718281…, to available precision. The mathematical constant τ = 6.283185…, to available precision. Tau is a circle constant equal to 2π, the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its radius. To learn more about Tau, check out Vi Hart’s video Pi is (still) Wrong, and start celebrating Tau day by eating twice as much pie! A floating-point positive infinity. (For negative infinity, use .) Equivalent to the output of . A floating-point “not a number” (NaN) value. Equivalent to the output of . Due to the requirements of the IEEE-754 standard, and are not considered to equal to any other numeric value, including themselves. To check whether a number is a NaN, use the function to test for NaNs instead of or . Example: Changed in version 3.11: It is now always available. CPython implementation detail: The module consists mostly of thin wrappers around the platform C math library functions. Behavior in exceptional cases follows Annex F of the C99 standard where appropriate. The current implementation will raise for invalid operations like or (where C99 Annex F recommends signaling invalid operation or divide-by-zero), and for results that overflow (for example, ). A NaN will not be returned from any of the functions above unless one or more of the input arguments was a NaN; in that case, most functions will return a NaN, but (again following C99 Annex F) there are some exceptions to this rule, for example or . Note that Python makes no effort to distinguish signaling NaNs from quiet NaNs, and behavior for signaling NaNs remains unspecified. Typical behavior is to treat all NaNs as though they were quiet.

Catching the tells us there is a problem, not what problem is happening.\n\nWe can know that exactly by making a modification like so:\n\nAdding this, and trying to evaluate acsc(-0.5), I get an error message:\n\nThat name, is not present anywhere in the given snippet, so let's dig deeper:\n\nI add a line inside that prints the exact expression that's being evaluated:\n\nRunning the code again with the same input, the problem becomes clear immediately:\n\nshould have become . Instead, it became . This is the hint we need to finally solve the problem. Let's look at the part of the code that is supposed to do the replacement:\n\nPython executes things from top to bottom. The first replacement happens before the last one.\n\nThus, the part from gets substituted, and the rest of the replacements don't do anything.\n\nWe can finally solve the problem by changing the order.\n\nMaking this change, when I enter acsc(-0.5), into the new program, I get the value as which is the correct and expected output.\n\nI hope this was helpful for you to understand about the issue you faced, and how you can approach issues in the future."
