        "document": "The Trade Ideas stock scanner is designed for all traders regardless of their experience. It is an all-inclusive tool, which carries out automated real-time analysis of charts under selected parameters. Trade Ideas detailed data on stock prices, identifies trends and patterns, and provides signals. This artificial intelligence is constantly analyzing the market and determining the best trade entry points, taking into account chart retrospection, statistical probabilities of the emergence of various patterns, and the trader’s risk tolerance. Trade Ideas AI review shows its exclusive effectiveness in intraday trading prediction. these are by far not all capabilities of the service. In this article, Traders Union discusses the full list of available features in detail and explains how to start using the platform.\n\nAt first glance, the Trade Ideas subscription fee seems rather high: $84 or $167 per month (including the annual discount), plus additional paid features. But when you take a closer look, it becomes obvious that, with proper approach, every dollar invested in access to the scanner pays off completely. The service evolves actively, adding latest solutions. For example, Trade Ideas recently introduced alert streaming, automated trading, and such a unique feature as a trading simulator for signal testing.\n\nHowever, a comprehensive review of Trade Ideas, including user feedback, shows that this is not the main benefit of the scanner. It can give you a clear trading strategy with particular trade entry points, based on the analysis of thousands of probabilities, huge arrays of statistical data, and mathematical predictions. Even a group of several dozen financial experts with modern software would not be able to do this.\n\nTrade Ideas is quite expensive. In fact, it’s more expensive than other similar tools. We say “similar” because by the number of features and their types this service makes Trade Ideas one of a kind. There is no other stock scanner, which uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to process information in the cloud and provide it to the user in a chart and interpretation of his choice. Notably,there is a PC app that can be downloaded from the Trade Ideas official website. The service has a browser version but does not have a mobile version, which is, in a way, an undoubted drawback.\n\nOne of the key benefits of Trade Ideas is its incredible performance when it comes to providing traders with an uninterrupted stream of strategies during a trading day. On the other hand, this tool is flexible enough for traders to be able to use statistical information and alerts to develop and apply their own strategies, constantly evaluating their effectiveness. However, there is no reason why you should not combining your own solutions with ideas provided by the scanner. For that, you do not need to know programming languages or be very experienced in trading.\n\nThis is an interesting feature, which Trade Ideas obviously borrowed from live streaming services that also have thematic channels. On the left side of the app’s home page, there are links to market environments. A click on the link changes the appearance of the screen to fully show the selected environment. The channels are devoted to cryptocurrencies and NFTs, stocks of top technology companies, leaders of power industry, biotechnologies, ideas for swing strategies, etc..\n\nWe have discussed basic capabilities that are mostly based on the Holly A.I. and real-time alert streaming above. However, Trade Ideas review shows that this is a multi-purpose platform aiming to improve profitability of trading in the stock market and offering a wide variety of tools that can be used by traders with any trading style and individual preferences. Here are some other capabilities of the Trade Ideas scanner:\n\nsers can set any notification to also be sent to their email address. Such notifications are delivered almost instantly, related both to signals and strategies. You can use typical notifications instead of going deep into customization. But if you need an individual approach, you can refer to an expert who will adapt notifications to your requirements.\n\nThis is actually one of the key tools. You don’t need all the analytics that the scanner can provide. Otherwise, you risk overloading your perception, which will get in the way of making informed decisions. That is why for all types of the scanner’s actions you can use filters, i.e., limits under selected parameters. Comprehensive comparison shows that out of all FinTech platforms Trade Ideas has the most filters, and they can be applied to any window. The list of filters has its own search engine so that you can quickly find what you need.\n\nOther Things You Need to Know about Trade Ideas\n\nWhat is a discount code and where do you get one?\n\nA discount code allows you to buy a subscription at a reduced price. The code is valid for a limited time. You can get it from an official partner of Trade Ideas. If you don’t know such partners, use a search engine or profile forums. The code can be used only once: during registration, after you choose a plan. Just enter the code in the corresponding field and the discount will be applied automatically.\n\nFive times a year, the platform conducts a test drive. During this event, new users can register on the Trade Ideas website and buy the Premium subscription for $11.11 for two weeks. This is a unique opportunity to discover all the features of the service at the lowest possible price. To find out when the next test drive is, keep track of the posts on the home page of the Trade Ideas website and in the blog."

        "document": "MetaStock is a proprietary computer program originally released by Computer Asset Management in 1985. It is used for charting and technical analysis of stock (and other asset) prices.[1][2] It has both real-time and end-of-day versions. MetaStock is a product of Innovative Market Analysis.\n\nIn 1982 Steve Achelis started a company named Computer Asset Management to develop financial and technical analysis software for personal computers. Computer Asset Management was renamed Equis International in 1989. Achelis’ first software application, written for the Apple II+, was The Financial Package which calculated various financial planning metrics. The Market Mood Monitor was released in 1984 and was eventually renamed The Technician. The Technician, written for the IBM PC, helped investors analyze and chart broad market conditions using sentiment, momentum, and monetary indicators. MetaStock 1.0 was released in 1986. Both MetaStock and The Technician received PC Magazine’s Editor’s Choice award in April 1986.[citation needed]\n\nWhile The Technician analyzed broad market conditions, MetaStock analyzed individual securities (stocks, futures, mutual funds, etc.). In response to the increasing demand for real-time analysis of prices, MetaStock RT was released in July 1992. MetaStock RT received live, real-time quotes from Data Broadcasting’s Signal data feed. In 1995, MetaStock 5.0 was released for the Microsoft Windows 3.1 operating system. Later that year, MetaStock added support for the Reuters DataLink end-of-day data feed. This relationship with Reuters led to Reuters purchasing Equis International and its MetaStock software in 1996. In 1998, MetaStock was released for the Reuters Quotron data feed and in 2001 for the Reuters 3000 Xtra electronic trading platform.[3] In June 2013, Thomson Reuters sold MetaStock to Innovative Market Analysis."

        "document": "If you're ready to dive into a realm where machines make lightning-fast decisions and financial markets become your playground, you're in the right place. But first, let's demystify the term: What exactly is algorithmic trading?\n\nAlgorithmic trading, often referred to as algo trading, is the practice of using computer programs (algorithms) to execute trading strategies with precision and speed. These algorithms analyze market data, identify opportunities, and execute trades autonomously, all within the blink of an eye. It's like having a financial superhero at your service, making trading decisions that mere mortals can't match in terms of speed and efficiency.\n\nNow that you're on board with the concept of algorithmic trading, let's delve into the mechanics of how it actually operates:\n• The journey begins with a torrent of market data—price quotes, trading volumes, news feeds, you name it. Algorithms ingest this data, sifting through it to identify patterns, trends, and potential trading opportunities.\n• Armed with insights from data analysis, algorithms formulate trading strategies. These strategies can be as simple as buying low and selling high or as complex as multi-factor models that consider various indicators and signals.\n• Algorithms make split-second decisions based on their pre-defined trading rules. They assess the data, evaluate their strategies, and decide whether to buy, sell, or hold positions.\n• Once a decision is made, algorithms send orders to the market. They can execute these orders across multiple venues and asset classes, ensuring the best possible execution prices.\n• Algorithms incorporate risk management protocols to protect against unexpected market movements. They set stop-loss orders, monitor positions, and adjust strategies as needed to limit losses.\n• Algorithmic trading systems operate 24/7, continuously monitoring markets for new opportunities and adapting to changing conditions in real time.\n\nHow to Start Algorithmic Trading with Stock API\n\nNow, the million-dollar question: How can you join the ranks of algorithmic traders and harness the power of automation for your trading endeavors? The answer lies in embracing stock APIs designed for algorithmic trading. Here's a roadmap to get you started:\n• Your journey begins by selecting a reputable stock API provider. Look for one that offers a robust set of features, real-time data, low-latency execution, and comprehensive documentation. (Psst, Intrinio is an excellent choice!)\n• Sign up for an API key or access credentials from your chosen provider. This key is your golden ticket to connect to the stock API and access market data and trading capabilities.\n• Take the time to thoroughly understand the API documentation provided by your chosen provider. It's your playbook for making requests, handling responses, and leveraging the API's capabilities.\n• If you're a developer or have coding skills, start crafting your trading algorithm. Define your strategy, set your rules, and program the algorithm to execute trades based on your criteria.\n• Before going live with real money, test your algorithm in a sandbox or paper trading environment. This allows you to iron out any kinks and fine-tune your strategy.\n• Once you're confident in your algorithm's performance, connect it to the real market using your API credentials. Start executing trades, monitoring positions, and reaping the benefits of automation.\n• The world of algorithmic trading is dynamic. Continuously monitor your algorithm's performance, gather data, and refine your strategies to stay competitive in the ever-evolving market.\n\nHow and Where to Find Algorithmic Trading API\n\nNow, the cherry on top: where and how do you find the perfect algorithmic trading API to kickstart your trading journey? Fear not; we've got you covered:\n• Interactive Brokers provides a feature-rich API for traders looking to automate their strategies. It's a favorite among professional traders and institutions. You can access most of what you need for simple strategies from Interactive brokers.\n• Alpaca offers commission-free trading through their API, making it a great choice for developers building trading apps and algorithms.\n• TD Ameritrade's API provides access to their trading platform, allowing you to execute trades and access market data programmatically.\n• Intrinio offers a cutting-edge stock trading API that provides real-time market data, historical prices, and a wealth of financial information. It's trusted by traders, developers, and financial institutions for its reliability and comprehensive data coverage. It doesn’t come with the restrictions inherent in getting market data through your broker - you are free to use it however and wherever you want!\n\nAnd there you have it, fellow traders and aspiring algorithmic wizards! With the right algorithmic trading API in your arsenal and a well-crafted trading strategy, you're poised for success in the world of automated trading. Whether you're aiming for lightning-fast executions or sophisticated quantitative strategies, algorithmic trading with a stock API opens up a world of possibilities. So, go ahead, seize the moment, and let your algorithms conquer the markets!"
