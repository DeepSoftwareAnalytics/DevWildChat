You can use the official Huami web editor to create watchfaces for these models. It's available on https://dev.huami.com/watchface/index.html#/create . However, this tool requires submitting your personal information (passport, photos, etc.) to get approved. This way isn't good for your privacy, and the approval takes too much time. You can bypass this and access the editor. Sign up on this site ( https://dev.huami.com/#/user/register/reg ), but don't complete step 2 which requires your personal data. Then enter the code below in your browser's JS console while in the editor:You will get full access to this editor. It even saves your watchfaces with uploaded resources to your account. The only bad thing in this editor is that you can't unpack existing .bin files.If you get issues with the editor again, run the code above again.\n\nI'm also having issues with the Huami editor - for me, it refuses to even export my work-in-progress test. Is there documentation of this tool, or a tutorial I can find somewhere? I'm a bit lost.\n\n \n\n ------------------------------\n\n \n\n Edit: I don't think it's possible to actually export watch faces this way, I just got an error having to do with my certification not having been processed yet. I deleted my draft, bit the bullet, and applied for the developer certification. Yuck. I simply don't want to have to upgrade to the GTS 2 non-mini, I don't have that kind of money right now.\n\n \n\n Either way, this tool seems rather buggy and confusing and I really, really wish someone would add Mini support to the GTS editor.

No matter what i try, editor downloads all the frames in .png format, but doesnt use them. It is apparent by file size when exported (.bin with and .bin w/o anim have the same size) and obviously is not used on watches themselves. I use GTS2mini.

I created several, the editor is very picky about the pictures, and their number.

To get rid of it I had to charge my watch so they could synchronize with the phone and then manually change watchface from this broken one to any other in the Zepp. Maybe someone knows WHY is this happening and HOW to make my watchface work...\n\nEvening all,\n\n \n\n (first post)...

The only exception is if you move the second hand from the center, it will be drawn under the hour and minute hands.If the .bin file is not created, then you need to look for errors in the .log file. Most often this happens when images have the wrong format.Pictures created when unpacking and unpacking bin files are created by the parser and may differ from the images created in the editor. I have nothing to do with these files and am not responsible for their content.When you turn on the \"Follow ...\" radio button, the right alignment and center alignment in the editor is displayed incorrectly.The preview in the editor may differ from the image on the watch. I advise you to check the dial on a real device.Editable zones do not work on the T-Rex Pro.The editor does not work with GTS 2 mini (GTS U) watch faces and I do not know how to make such watch faces.Until the Zepp app has an official watch face with animations or shortcuts, these features cannot be added to the editor.Shortcuts work on dials converted from GTR (GTS) to GTR 2 (GTS 2). But with this method of creating dials, not all functions work correctly.Because I bought a GTR 3, the program will no longer be updated.Donate to the author - PayPal:"
