The implementation returns lazily-computed , making it pretty efficient. Use as: The returned will be an that looks like:\n\nI would suggest creating an iterable of the pairs, and using .toList if you really need it as a list. This solution can also be applied to any iterable, not just a list. First, a simple solution that only works on lists (with even length)(Like the solution provided from Robert King): The more general solution is complex: class mappedIterable extends Object implements Iterable with IterableMixin { Function generator; mappedIterable(Iterable source, Iterator this.generator(Iterator in)); Iterator get iterator => generator(source.iterator); } class Pairs implements Iterator { Iterator _source; List _current = null; Pairs(Iterator this._source); List get current => _current; bool moveNext() { bool result = _source.moveNext(); _current = [_source.current, (_source..moveNext()).current]; return result; } } Iterable makePairs(Iterable source) => new mappedIterable(source, (sourceIterator) => new Pairs(sourceIterator)); print(makePairs(letters)) It seems like it is actually easier to make a stream of pairs from a stream, than to make an iterable of pairs from an iterable.\n\nAdding my 2 cents on this question, I wish there was a solution that accepts negative numbers (to allow chunk in reverse order), so here we are: import 'dart:math'; extension ChunkedList<T> on List<T> { List<List<T>> chunked(int size, {bool incomplete = false}) { if (size == 0) { throw ArgumentError.value( size, 'chunked', '[size] must be a non-zero integer.', ); } final List<T> target = size.isNegative ? reversed.toList() : toList(); final int n = size.abs(); final int base = incomplete ? (length / n).ceil() : (length / n).floor(); return <List<T>>[ for (int i = 0; i < base; i++) target.sublist(i * n, min((i + 1) * n, length)), ]; } }\n\nInfluenced by @Alan's answer above and extending List, the equivalent of F# chunkedBySize and windowed and average could be: import 'dart:collection'; class functionalList<E> extends ListBase<E> { final List<E> l = []; functionalList(); void set length(int newLength) { l.length = newLength; } int get length => l.length; E operator [](int index) => l[index]; void operator []=(int index, E value) { l[index] = value; } chunkBySize(int size) => _chunkBySize(l, size); windowed(int size) => _windowed(l, size); get average => l.isEmpty ? 0 : l.fold(0, (t, e) => t + e) / l.length; _chunkBySize(List list, int size) => list.isEmpty ? list : ([list.take(size)]..addAll(_chunkBySize(list.skip(size), size))); _windowed(List list, int size) => list.isEmpty ? list : ([list.take(size)]..addAll(_windowed(list.skip(1), size))); } void main() { var list = new functionalList(); list.addAll([1,2,3]); print(list.chunkBySize(2)); } The implementation can be seen here\n\nNow that Dart has loops inside list literals, another possible approach is: or, slightly shorter, but not as efficient: Those can, as usual, also be made as extension methods instead, as: extension ListChunk<T> on List<T> { List<List<T>> chunk(int chunkSize) => ... `this` instead of `elements` ... }\n\nThanks for contributing an answer to Stack Overflow!\n• Please be sure to answer the question.

Dart, a versatile programming language, provides a robust set of methods for manipulating lists, enabling efficient data management and manipulation. This article delves into the intricacies of list manipulation in Dart, equipping you with the knowledge and skills to handle lists with ease.\n\nDart offers various ways to initialize lists. The most straightforward approach is to use square brackets and specify the elements within:\n\nAlternatively, you can utilize the constructor to create a fixed-length list with a specific fill value:\n\nTo access individual elements within a list, use the square brackets notation and the element's index:\n\nThe method provides an alternative way to access elements:\n\nUsing the method: This method adds a single element at the end of the list.\n\nUsing the method: This method adds multiple elements at the end of the list.\n• Using the method: This method removes the first occurrence of a specified value.\n• Using the method: This method removes an element at a specific index.\n• Using the method: This method removes the last element from the list.\n• Using the method: This method removes an item based on a condition .\n• Using the index operator ( ): This allows us to access and update elements using their index.\n• Using the method: This method replaces a range of elements with another list.\n• Using the method: This method filters elements based on a specific condition.\n• Using the method: This method removes elements based on a specific condition.\n• Using the method: This method sorts elements in ascending order.\n• Using the method with a custom comparator: This allows us to sort elements based on a custom criteria.\n\nTo reverse the order of elements in a list, you can use the property or the method.\n\nIterating through a list to process its elements is a common task in programming. Dart provides various iteration methods, including loops, loops, and the method for conditional iteration.\n\nLists can be searched using the\n\nList comprehension is a shorthand syntax in Dart for creating a new list by iterating over an existing list and applying an expression to each element. The resulting list is constructed by including elements that evaluate to true in the expression.\n\nHere’s an example that uses list comprehension to filter out even numbers from an existing list:\n\nIn this example, the expression x for (var x in numbers) if (x % 2 == 0) creates a new list by iterating over each element in the list and only including the elements that are divisible by 2.\n\nYou can also use list comprehension to apply transformations or calculations to elements in the original list. For example:\n\nIn this example, the expression creates a new list by squaring each element in the list.\n\nIn conclusion, manipulation of lists is a crucial aspect of programming in Dart. Mastering the various methods and techniques for manipulating lists can greatly improve the efficiency, readability, and functionality of your Dart code. By understanding how to add, remove, access, and modify elements in a list, developers can optimize their programs and solve complex problems more effectively. Whether it is merging lists, sorting elements, or filtering based on specific conditions, the list manipulation capabilities in Dart provide a wide range of powerful tools. With practice and experience, programmers can harness the full potential of list manipulation in Dart to create robust and dynamic applications."

        "document": "Dart is a versatile programming language that, while commonly associated with building web and mobile applications through frameworks like Flutter, is also well-suited for implementing a broad range of algorithms. Algorithms are essential for solving problems efficiently and are fundamental to computer science. This article provides an in-depth exploration of various types of algorithms that you can implement in Dart, categorized by their specific use cases.\n\nSorting algorithms are used to arrange elements in a list or array in a specific order. Dart’s method is a built-in mechanism for sorting, but understanding different sorting algorithms is crucial for optimization and learning.\n• Bubble Sort: A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It has a time complexity of O(n2)O(n²)O(n2) in the worst case.\n• Insertion Sort: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It’s efficient for small datasets or nearly sorted arrays, with a time complexity of O(n2)O(n²)O(n2) in the worst case.\n• Selection Sort: Selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first unsorted element. It has a time complexity of O(n2)O(n²)O(n2).\n• Merge Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the list into halves, sorts each half, and then merges them back together. It has a time complexity of O(nlog⁡n)O(n \\log n)O(nlogn).\n• Quick Sort: Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a ‘pivot’ element and partitions the list into elements less than and greater than the pivot. It has an average-case time complexity of O(nlog⁡n)O(n \\log n)O(nlogn).\n• Heap Sort: Converts the list into a heap and then repeatedly extracts the maximum element to build the sorted list. It has a time complexity of O(nlog⁡n)O(n \\log n)O(nlogn).\n• Radix Sort: A non-comparative sorting algorithm that sorts numbers by processing individual digits. It’s efficient for large datasets with bounded digit lengths, with a time complexity of O(nk)O(nk)O(nk), where kkk is the number of digits.\n\nSearching algorithms are used to find a specific element within a collection.\n• Linear Search: Iterates through each element in the list until the desired element is found or the end of the list is reached. It has a time complexity of O(n)O(n)O(n).\n• Binary Search: Searches a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. It’s efficient with a time complexity of O(log⁡n)O(\\log n)O(logn) but requires the list to be sorted.\n\nGraph algorithms are used for processing graphs, which consist of nodes (vertices) and edges.\n• Depth-First Search (DFS): Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Useful for pathfinding and graph traversal. It has a time complexity of O(V+E)O(V + E)O(V+E), where VVV is the number of vertices and EEE is the number of edges.\n• Breadth-First Search (BFS): Explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. Useful for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. It also has a time complexity of O(V+E)O(V + E)O(V+E).\n• Dijkstra’s Algorithm: Finds the shortest paths from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph with non-negative weights. It has a time complexity of O(V2)O(V²)O(V2) with a simple implementation, but can be improved with priority queues.\n• Bellman-Ford Algorithm: Computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a graph, handling negative weights. It has a time complexity of O(V⋅E)O(V \\cdot E)O(V⋅E).\n• A Algorithm*: An extension of Dijkstra’s algorithm that uses heuristics to improve performance in pathfinding and graph traversal. It has a time complexity of O(E)O(E)O(E), where EEE is the number of edges.\n• Kruskal’s Algorithm: Finds the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph by sorting all edges and adding them one by one, ensuring no cycles are formed. It has a time complexity of O(Elog⁡E)O(E \\log E)O(ElogE).\n• Prim’s Algorithm: Another MST algorithm that grows the MST one edge at a time, starting from an arbitrary vertex. It has a time complexity of O(Elog⁡V)O(E \\log V)O(ElogV).\n\nDynamic programming is used for solving problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant computations.\n• Fibonacci Sequence: Computes Fibonacci numbers using memoization or iterative methods to avoid redundant calculations.\n• Knapsack Problem: Determines the maximum value that can be achieved with a given weight capacity. It can be solved using dynamic programming with a time complexity of O(n⋅W)O(n \\cdot W)O(n⋅W), where nnn is the number of items and WWW is the maximum weight.\n• Longest Common Subsequence (LCS): Finds the longest subsequence common to two sequences. It has a time complexity of O(m⋅n)O(m \\cdot n)O(m⋅n), where mmm and nnn are the lengths of the two sequences.\n• Matrix Chain Multiplication: Determines the most efficient way to multiply a sequence of matrices. It has a time complexity of O(n3)O(n³)O(n3), where nnn is the number of matrices.\n• Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Pattern Matching: Efficiently searches for a substring within a string using precomputed partial match information. It has a time complexity of O(n+m)O(n + m)O(n+m), where nnn is the length of the text and mmm is the length of the pattern.\n• Rabin-Karp Algorithm: Uses hashing to find any one of a set of pattern strings in a text. It has an average time complexity of O(n+m)O(n + m)O(n+m).\n• Boyer-Moore Algorithm: Uses bad character and good suffix heuristics to search for a substring in a text efficiently. It has an average time complexity of O(n/m)O(n / m)O(n/m), where nnn is the length of the text and mmm is the length of the pattern.\n\nThese algorithms are based on specific data structures used for efficient operations.\n• Trie Operations: A trie is a tree-like data structure used to store associative data structures. Operations include insertion, deletion, and search, all with time complexity proportional to the length of the string.\n• Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find): Manages a collection of disjoint (non-overlapping) sets and supports union and find operations efficiently. It has nearly constant time complexity due to path compression and union by rank.\n• Euclidean Algorithm: Computes the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers using iterative or recursive methods with a time complexity of O(log⁡min⁡(a,b))O(\\log \\min(a, b))O(logmin(a,b))\n• Sieve of Eratosthenes: Efficiently finds all prime numbers up to a given limit by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime number. It has a time complexity of O(nlog⁡log⁡n)O(n \\log \\log n)O(nloglogn).\n• Fast Exponentiation: Computes large powers of numbers efficiently using exponentiation by squaring, with a time complexity of O(log⁡n)O(\\log n)O(logn).\n• Convex Hull: Determines the smallest convex polygon that can enclose a set of points. Algorithms include Graham’s Scan and Andrew’s Monotone Chain, both with a time complexity of O(nlog⁡n)O(n \\log n)O(nlogn).\n• Line Intersection: Finds the intersection points of lines or segments, with algorithms varying in complexity based on the problem constraints.\n\nGreedy algorithms make a series of choices that are locally optimal in the hope of finding a global optimum.\n• Activity Selection Problem: Selects the maximum number of activities that don’t overlap, using a greedy approach to pick activities based on their end times.\n• Huffman Coding: Constructs an optimal prefix code for a set of symbols based on their frequencies, used in data compression. It has a time complexity of O(nlog⁡n)O(n \\log n)O(nlogn).\n\nBacktracking algorithms explore possible solutions by trying to build a solution incrementally and backtracking when a partial solution fails.\n• N-Queens Problem: Places n queens on an n×nn \\times nn×n chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. It’s typically solved using recursive backtracking.\n• Sudoku Solver: Solves Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking approach to try possible numbers in each cell and backtrack when a constraint is violated.\n\nMachine learning algorithms are used for data analysis and predictive modeling.\n• K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Classifies data points based on the majority class among their k-nearest neighbors, with a time complexity of O(n⋅d)O(n \\cdot d)O(n⋅d), where nnn is the number of points and ddd is the number of features.\n• Linear Regression: Models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a linear equation. It has a time complexity of O(n⋅d2)O(n \\cdot d²)O(n⋅d2) for training.\n• Decision Trees: Constructs a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences. The complexity depends on the number of features and depth of the tree.\n\nUnderstanding and implementing a variety of algorithms in Dart empowers developers to tackle a wide range of problems efficiently. From sorting and searching to complex graph algorithms and machine learning, Dart provides the flexibility and power needed for effective problem-solving. Mastery of these algorithms not only enhances programming skills but also prepares you for optimizing and scaling applications in diverse domains.\n\n❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Thanks for reading this article ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤\n\nIf I got something wrong?

        "document": "Over the past several years, we've written a ton of Dart code and learned a lot about what works well and what doesn't. We're sharing this with you so you can write consistent, robust, fast code too. There are two overarching themes:\n• None Be consistent. When it comes to things like formatting, and casing, arguments about which is better are subjective and impossible to resolve. What we do know is that being consistent is objectively helpful. If two pieces of code look different it should be because they are different in some meaningful way. When a bit of code stands out and catches your eye, it should do so for a useful reason.\n• None Be brief. Dart was designed to be familiar, so it inherits many of the same statements and expressions as C, Java, JavaScript and other languages. But we created Dart because there is a lot of room to improve on what those languages offer. We added a bunch of features, from string interpolation to initializing formals, to help you express your intent more simply and easily. If there are multiple ways to say something, you should generally pick the most concise one. This is not to say you should code golf yourself into cramming a whole program into a single line. The goal is code that is economical, not dense.\n\nWe split the guidelines into a few separate pages for easy digestion:\n• None Style Guide – This defines the rules for laying out and organizing code, or at least the parts that doesn't handle for you. The style guide also specifies how identifiers are formatted: , , etc.\n• None Documentation Guide – This tells you everything you need to know about what goes inside comments. Both doc comments and regular, run-of-the-mill code comments.\n• None Usage Guide – This teaches you how to make the best use of language features to implement behavior. If it's in a statement or expression, it's covered here.\n• None Design Guide – This is the softest guide, but the one with the widest scope. It covers what we've learned about designing consistent, usable APIs for libraries. If it's in a type signature or declaration, this goes over it.\n\nFor links to all the guidelines, see the summary.\n\nEach guide is broken into a few sections. Sections contain a list of guidelines. Each guideline starts with one of these words:\n• None DO guidelines describe practices that should always be followed. There will almost never be a valid reason to stray from them.\n• None DON'T guidelines are the converse: things that are almost never a good idea. Hopefully, we don't have as many of these as other languages do because we have less historical baggage.\n• None PREFER guidelines are practices that you should follow. However, there may be circumstances where it makes sense to do otherwise. Just make sure you understand the full implications of ignoring the guideline when you do.\n• None AVOID guidelines are the dual to \"prefer\": stuff you shouldn't do but where there may be good reasons to on rare occasions.\n• None CONSIDER guidelines are practices that you might or might not want to follow, depending on circumstances, precedents, and your own preference.\n\nSome guidelines describe an exception where the rule does not apply. When listed, the exceptions may not be exhaustive—you might still need to use your judgement on other cases.\n\nThis sounds like the police are going to beat down your door if you don't have your laces tied correctly. Things aren't that bad. Most of the guidelines here are common sense and we're all reasonable people. The goal, as always, is nice, readable and maintainable code.\n\nThe Dart analyzer provides a linter to help you write good, consistent code that follows these and other guidelines. If one or more linter rules exist that can help you follow a guideline then the guideline links to those rules. The links use the following format:\n\nTo learn how to use the linter, see Enabling linter rules and the list of linter rules.\n\nTo keep the guidelines brief, we use a few shorthand terms to refer to different Dart constructs.\n• None A library member is a top-level field, getter, setter, or function. Basically, anything at the top level that isn't a type.\n• None A class member is a constructor, field, getter, setter, function, or operator declared inside a class. Class members can be instance or static, abstract or concrete.\n• None A member is either a library member or a class member.\n• None A variable, when used generally, refers to top-level variables, parameters, and local variables. It doesn't include static or instance fields.\n• None A type is any named type declaration: a class, typedef, or enum.\n• None A property is a top-level variable, getter (inside a class or at the top level, instance or static), setter (same), or field (instance or static). Roughly any \"field-like\" named construct.\n\nUnless stated otherwise, the documentation on this site reflects Dart 3.7.1. Page last updated on 2024-05-06. View source or report an issue."
