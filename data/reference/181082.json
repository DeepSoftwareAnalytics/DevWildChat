Responsive web design is a preferable alternative and an efficient way to target a wide range of devices with much less efforts.\n\nResponsive layouts automatically adjust and adapts to any device screen size, whether it is a desktop, a laptop, a tablet, or a mobile phone. See the following Illustration.\n\nWith the Bootstrap powerful mobile first flexbox grid system creating the responsive and mobile friendly websites and applications has become much easier.\n\nBootstrap is responsive and mobile friendly from the start. Its six tier grid classes provides better control over the layout as well as how it will be rendered on different types of devices like mobile phones, tablets, laptops and desktops, large screen devices, and so on.\n\nThe following example will create a responsive layout that is rendered as 4 column layout in extra-large devices (viewport ≥ 1200px), and 3 column layout in large devices (992px ≤ viewport < 1200px), whereas 2 column layout in medium devices (768px ≤ viewport < 992px), and 1 column layout in small and extra-small devices (viewport < 768px). Let's try it out and see how it works:"

        "document": "Bootstrap is astrong, open-source toolkit for building responsive, mobile-first projects on the web. It has proved itself as an indispensable tool for web developers globally, offering a wide array of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components. Whether you are new to Bootstrap or a seasoned developer, employing best practices can streamline your workflow and increase the efficiency and quality of your web projects. In this article, we will explore some of these best practices.\n\nBootstrap’s grid system is built on a responsive, mobile-first, flexbox grid system. This 12-column structure ensures that your website is readily adaptable across different screen sizes. To effectively use the grid system, remember to:\n• Keep It Nested: Keep your content within containers and rows for proper alignment and padding. Columns should be immediate children of rows.\n• Mind the Numbers: Bootstrap operates on a 12-part grid. This means that the sum of the parts of your grid on a single line should always add up to 12.\n\nBootstrap is designed for customization. While it’s easy to use the out-of-the-box styles, Bootstrap’s strength lies in its versatility. You should:\n• Utilize SASS/LESS: Bootstrap allows you to customize its variables using CSS preprocessors like SASS or LESS. This can drastically alter the look and feel of your site without much effort.\n• Override Styles Sensibly: Avoid changes to the Bootstrap source files. Instead, write new styles in separate CSS files, making maintenance and upgrades easier.\n\nMaking Use of Bootstrap Classes and Components\n\nBootstrap offers numerous CSS classes and components that facilitate efficient and rapid web development. Using them can greatly simplify your HTML and CSS. Key points to note:\n• Opt for Bootstrap Classes: Before writing any custom CSS, check if there’s an existing Bootstrap class that can do the job.\n• Components for Efficiency: Components like Navbar, Dropdowns, Alerts, Modals, and Carousels, among others, are reusable and can save you coding time.\n\nBootstrap’s utility classes can save you from writing additional CSS, improving your development speed. These are powerful tools for managing spacing, display, sizing, and more.\n\nAccessibility should be a priority in web development. Thankfully, Bootstrap provides built-in classes and attributes that assist in making your site accessible:\n• Use of ARIA Roles: ARIA roles and properties, such as or , provide necessary information to assistive technologies.\n• Alternative Texts: Always provide alternative text for images using the attribute.\n\nKeep up with Updates\n\nBootstrap is actively maintained and regularly updated. Keep track of updates, as they often come with bug fixes, improved features, and new components.\n\nAs a responsive framework, your Bootstrap-based project should be tested across multiple browsers and devices to ensure consistency and usability.\n\nMastering and implementing Bootstrap best practices can significantly improve your web development process, making it more efficient and less error-prone. Remember, the objective is to leverage Bootstrap’s full potential while customizing it to meet your specific needs. Happy coding!"

        "document": "In today’s digital landscape, the ability to create responsive websites is essential for reaching a diverse audience across various devices. With the rise of mobile browsing, web developers must ensure that their designs adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and orientations. Bootstrap 5, the latest iteration of the popular front-end framework, provides an efficient and powerful solution for building responsive layouts. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the process of creating responsive websites using Bootstrap 5, covering everything from its core concepts to practical examples and best practices.\n\nBootstrap 5 has revolutionized the way developers approach web design by offering a robust set of tools and components that simplify the creation of responsive layouts. At its core, Bootstrap is built on a mobile-first philosophy, meaning that it prioritizes mobile devices in its design approach. This ensures that websites not only look good on desktops but also provide an optimal user experience on smartphones and tablets.\n\nThe framework employs a flexible grid system, responsive utility classes, and a plethora of pre-designed components that facilitate rapid development. By leveraging these features, developers can create visually appealing and functional websites without extensive coding knowledge. In this guide, we will explore the key elements of Bootstrap 5 that contribute to responsive design, including its grid system, utility classes, and components.\n\nBootstrap is an open-source front-end framework developed by Twitter that provides developers with a collection of CSS and JavaScript components for building responsive websites. The framework simplifies the process of designing web pages by offering pre-styled elements like buttons, forms, navigation bars, and grids.\n• Mobile-First Approach: Bootstrap 5 is designed with mobile devices in mind. This means that styles are applied first to smaller screens and then adjusted for larger devices using media queries.\n• Responsive Grid System: The grid system is one of Bootstrap’s most powerful features. It allows developers to create complex layouts using a series of rows and columns that adapt to different screen sizes.\n• Pre-Styled Components: Bootstrap comes with a variety of pre-designed UI components that can be easily integrated into projects, saving time and effort.\n• Customizable: Developers can customize Bootstrap’s styles using SASS variables or by overriding default styles in their CSS files.\n• JavaScript Plugins: Bootstrap includes several JavaScript plugins that enhance interactivity, such as modals, tooltips, and carousels.\n\nBefore diving into building responsive layouts with Bootstrap 5, it’s essential to set up your development environment. Here’s a step-by-step guide:\n• Create a New Project Folder: Start by creating a new folder on your computer where you will store your project files.\n• Include Bootstrap in Your Project:\n\nYou can include Bootstrap in your project either via CDN (Content Delivery Network) or by downloading the files directly. Using CDN:\n\nAdd the following lines within the section of your HTML file:\n\nDownloading Bootstrap:\n\nAlternatively, you can download the compiled CSS and JS files from the Bootstrap website. Once downloaded, link them in your HTML file similarly.\n• Set Up Basic HTML Structure:\n\nCreate an file in your project folder and set up a basic HTML structure:\n\nThe backbone of responsive design in Bootstrap is its powerful grid system. The grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content effectively.\n\nContainers are used to wrap your content and provide proper alignment and padding. There are two types of containers in Bootstrap:\n• : A fixed-width container that adjusts its width based on the screen size.\n• : A full-width container that spans the entire width of the viewport.\n\nWithin a container, you can create rows using the class. Each row can contain up to 12 columns defined by classes such as , , , , etc., which determine how many columns an element should span at different breakpoints.\n\nHere’s an example of how to create a simple grid layout:\n\nIn this example, we create a container with one row containing three columns that each take up one-third of the available width on medium-sized screens or larger.\n\nThese breakpoints allow developers to specify how many columns an element should span at various screen sizes, ensuring optimal display across devices.\n\nNow that we understand the basics of containers, rows, columns, and breakpoints, let’s dive into creating responsive layouts using these concepts.\n\nHere’s how you can create a simple responsive grid layout for a portfolio website:\n\nIn this example:\n• We created a portfolio section with three project cards.\n• Each card is wrapped in a column that adjusts its size based on screen width—two cards per row on small screens (≥576px) and three cards per row on medium screens (≥768px).\n\nBootstrap provides utility classes for margin ( ) and padding ( ) to control spacing between elements easily:\n\nIn this example:\n\nBootstrap’s responsive utility classes allow developers to show or hide elements based on screen size easily. This feature is particularly useful when you want to optimize content delivery for users across devices.\n\nIn this example:\n• The first div uses , which hides it on extra small (xs) and small (sm) screens but shows it on medium (md) screens and larger.\n\nWhile Bootstrap provides many built-in classes for responsiveness, you may sometimes need custom media queries for specific design needs:\n\nThis custom media query changes the background color of elements with when viewed on screens smaller than or equal to 768 pixels wide.\n\nA crucial aspect of any website is its navigation bar. With Bootstrap’s built-in components, creating a responsive navbar is straightforward:\n\nIn this example:\n• The navbar collapses into a toggle button on smaller screens.\n\nTo ensure images scale correctly across different devices while maintaining their aspect ratios, use the utility:\n\nThis ensures images resize responsively within their parent containers without exceeding their original dimensions.\n\nBest Practices for Building Responsive Websites with Bootstrap\n\nCreating responsive websites using Bootstrap involves more than just understanding its components; it also requires adhering to best practices for optimal results:\n• Plan Your Layout: Before starting development, sketch out your layout ideas or use wireframing tools to visualize how elements will be arranged across different devices.\n• Utilize Grid Classes Effectively: Leverage Bootstrap’s grid system to create flexible layouts that adapt seamlessly across various screen sizes while maintaining visual hierarchy.\n• Optimize Images: Use appropriately sized images for different resolutions to improve loading times without sacrificing quality.\n• Test Responsiveness: Regularly test your designs across multiple devices using browser developer tools or online services like BrowserStack to ensure consistent performance.\n• Leverage Utility Classes: Use utility classes provided by Bootstrap for spacing, alignment, visibility control, etc., rather than writing custom CSS whenever possible—this keeps your code cleaner and more maintainable.\n• Stay Updated: Keep abreast of updates from Bootstrap as new features are added or existing ones improved—this ensures you’re utilizing best practices in your projects.\n\nCreating responsive websites has never been easier thanks to frameworks like Bootstrap 5 that offer powerful tools designed specifically for modern web development challenges. By understanding how to leverage its grid system effectively alongside its array of pre-styled components and utility classes, developers can build visually appealing sites optimized for all devices seamlessly.\n\nAs we have explored throughout this guide—from setting up your development environment to implementing advanced techniques—Bootstrap empowers you with everything needed to craft responsive layouts efficiently while adhering to best practices in web design.\n\nWith continuous advancements in technology shaping user expectations around accessibility and usability online today more than ever before; mastering these skills will not only enhance your capabilities as a developer but also contribute significantly towards delivering exceptional experiences tailored specifically for every visitor regardless of their device choice!"

        "document": "Mobile-first design is important for customer engagement. With more than 60% of overall web traffic coming from mobile devices, a mobile-first approach is a must for web application development.\n\nThis guide will help you incorporate the mobile-first design strategy for building device-friendly apps and websites that prioritize mobile user experience.\n\nMobile-first design or Mobile-first approach enables web designers to start product design for mobile devices first. This can be done by sketching or prototyping the web app’s design for the smallest screen first and gradually working up to larger screen sizes.\n\nPrioritizing design for mobiles makes sense as there are space limitations in devices with smaller screen sizes, and teams need to ensure that the key elements of the website are prominently displayed for anyone using those screens.\n\nDesigning and developing for small screens compels designers to remove anything that isn’t necessary for seamless website rendering and navigation.\n\nHow Mobile-First Design Strategy Came To Be?\n\nEarlier, websites were often developed with the assumption that they would be primarily accessed from desktops. Eventually, developers made an attempt to modify these websites by cutting down some functions to enhance browsing on mobile or tablet devices.\n\nThis approach of scaling down the websites is popularly known as Graceful Degradation or Desktop-First approach.\n• A downside to this approach is that several web elements do not adapt well to smaller screen sizes. Consequently, this degrades the visual appearance of websites on smaller devices.\n\nTo address this problem, developers came up with another approach – Progressive Advancement or Mobile-First Design.\n• A mobile-first approach encouraged designers to begin the website designing process for the smallest devices first and then add more functionalities for bigger screen sizes.\n\nMobile devices have become an integral part of the present web landscape and will continue to be vital for the future as well. As mentioned in the beginning, mobile contributes to approximately half of the overall web traffic.\n\nOne must also bear in mind that the number of mobile users has surpassed desktop users. As per Statcounter GlobalStats, overall mobile users continue to grow with a leading market share of 64.25% as compared to desktop users.\n\nSmartphone Usage Statistics addresses a few stats to reconsider the mobile-first approach:\n• Smartphone users tend to spend an average of 3 hours and 15 minutes on their phones.\n• Millennials spend more than 5.7 hours on their smartphones per day\n\nThe stats above clearly reveal how users across the globe are slowly shifting from desktops to mobile devices. Naturally, it would make sense for web designers to prioritize their efforts and follow the “mobile-first” rule in product design.\n\nHere are some of the notable advantages of having a mobile-first approach for web development:\n• Improved User Experience: Prioritizes essential features and functionality for mobile users, leading to a streamlined and intuitive design.\n• Cost Efficiency: Reduces the need for costly redesigns by addressing mobile constraints from the outset.\n• Future-Readiness: Prepares websites for the increasing dominance of mobile traffic and emerging mobile technologies.\n• Focus on Core Content: Encourages prioritization of essential content and functionality, reducing clutter.\n• Seamless Scalability: This makes it easier to progressively enhance the design for larger screens.\n\nMobile-first design simplifies interfaces, prioritizes essential content, and enhances readability with legible fonts and high contrast, making it easier for users with disabilities to navigate and interact. Touch-friendly elements like larger buttons improve accessibility for those with motor impairments.\n\nGoogle’s Chrome User Experience Report (CrUX) and Core Web Vitals play a vital role by measuring real-world user performance, focusing on metrics like loading speed, interactivity, and visual stability. These insights ensure mobile-first designs are fast, responsive, and accessible, aligning with WCAG standards and enhancing usability across all devices.\n\nHow to Implement Mobile-First Approach in Product Design?\n\nNow let’s understand how designers can bring mobile-first responsive design into practice.\n\nLet’s assume a web designer needs to work on a website for a restaurant. Since the designer needs to follow the mobile-first approach, they must think about what a user will expect from a restaurant website on a mobile device.\n\nDesigners must identify the primary things that an end-user is looking for while accessing a restaurant website on a mobile device. Given the user is on mobile, it would be safe to assume that they are mainly searching for – operating hours, exact location, and contact details (or click to call button given it’s mobile). On the basis of these assumptions, the page can be designed precisely as follows.\n\nIn the case of tablets, users have more space and probably more time to explore the website. Designers can leverage this by adding more functionalities or information regarding the food menu (images), or chef details as displayed below:\n\nWhen it comes to desktops, web designers have all the required space to showcase more details. These details can include blog posts, images of party events recently hosted, the ambiance, or contact forms to promote the restaurant better.\n\nFollowing the approach above will help designers build websites keeping the mobile audience in mind. Additionally, expanding functionalities for larger screen sizes will also be easy to accomplish for teams.\n\nThe table below highlights the key differences between Mobile-First Design and Responsive Web Design to help you understand their unique approaches and applications.\n\nHere is a list of tools that help you accomplish a successful mobile-first design:\n• Adobe XD: A versatile tool for wireframing and prototyping mobile and web applications.\n• Google Mobile-Friendly Test: A tool to check if your site meets mobile usability standards.\n• Google PageSpeed Insights: Analyzes and improves the performance of mobile-first websites.\n• BrowserStack (for testing): Provides cross-browser and device testing for mobile compatibility.\n\nBest Practices for The Mobile-First Approach\n\nFor complex and layered designs, web designers UI/UX experts must bear in mind the following best practices to ensure a mobile-first approach effectively:\n\nWhen it comes to mobile-first design, designers must bear in mind the fact that content is the key. As there are space restrictions on smaller screens, web designers must ensure that the most critical elements are prominently displayed since those are the ones users will actively look for.\n\nIntuitive navigation is of utmost importance when it comes to delivering a neat and clean user experience on mobile devices. Web designers can leverage features like navigation drawers (using Hamburger menus) to display secondary elements of the website. This will help users to find the necessary information easily.\n\nSpeed and intuitiveness go hand in hand. SpeedLab by BrowserStack instantly provides you Page Speed Score out of 100 for both Desktop and Mobile platforms. With these insights, your design team can optimize for a mobile-friendly interface across different mobile devices and browsers.\n\nWith BrowserStack, you also get actionable recommendations and insights to improve your overall design and website layout.\n\nThe report generates accurate mobile and desktop scores along with key metrics like Navigation Timing API, Page Resource Summary, and more, to help you align your mobile-first design approach with actual performance.\n\nAs mentioned frequently, mobile devices have space constraints and no user likes to be accosted with sudden pop-ups or advertisements taking over the screen. Website owners or designers must only focus on what’s important for users and provide them with the things they are looking for in the first place.\n\nThe most effective way of ensuring that a website delivers optimal user experiences across devices is by testing them on real devices. This helps designers verify whether the website renders as expected across mobiles, tablets, and desktops. BrowserStack’s real device cloud provides teams and individual testers with 3000+ real devices and browsers for instant testing in real user conditions.\n\nBrowserStack also offers individual users or teams an intuitive Responsive Checker tool. This tool allows users to instantly view their websites across different device types like mobiles, tablets, and desktops. This enables users to verify whether their websites render correctly as expected on specific devices.\n\nHow to run a responsive test on BrowserStack?\n\nIncreasing numbers of web users across the globe have shifted from desktop to mobile devices for accessing the web and the trend shows no sign of stopping. Consequently, it makes sense for designers to develop websites keeping the mobile audience as a priority.\n\nIncorporating a mobile-first design will not only help businesses reap the rewards of mobile growth today but will also prepare them for the explosive growth that is predicted in the coming years."

        "document": "Mobile-first design is an approach to designing UIs that prioritizes small-screen experience. Given that different devices need different layouts based on their screen size and orientation, it makes sense to design multiple arrangements for your users. This article will show you how to create a mobile-first prototype of a product and transform it into tablet and desktop screens.\n\nMake your own responsive variations right in UXPin. Create a mobile-first design and scale it up for tablet and desktop views in UXPin – an advanced prototyping tool. Go ahead and create a free trial and follow along below.\n\nThe mobile-first approach is designing for the smallest screen and working your way up. It is one of the best strategies to create either a responsive or adaptive design.\n• The mobile-first approach is a tenet of progressive enhancement. It is the ideology that mobile design, as the hardest, should be done first. Once the mobile design questions are answered, designing for other devices will be easier. What it boils down to is that, the smallest of the designs will have only the essential features, so right away you have designed the heart of your UX.\n• The opposite approach is graceful degradation. This incorporates all of the complexities right from the start, then strips them away later for smaller devices. The problem with graceful degradation is that when you build the all-inclusive design right from the start, the core and supplementary elements merge and become harder to distinguish and separate. The entire philosophy runs the risk of treating mobile design as more of an afterthought since you’re “cutting down” the experience.\n\nWe, along with others, strongly recommend progressive enhancement with a mobile-first approach. In this post, we’ll explain tips & techniques, then finish off with a hands-on lesson in which we build a hypothetical website with the mobile-first workflow.\n\nMobile-first design is also a response to the realities of modern user behavior and technological advancements, such as increasing mobile usage, future-proofing the design, and more. By prioritizing mobile, designers can ensure a more effective and efficient design process that meets the needs of the majority of users.\n\nMobile-first design has been adopted by numerous organizations across various industries. Here are some notable examples and case studies of companies that successfully implemented mobile-first design.\n• Context: As a leading technology company, Google recognized the shift toward mobile usage early on.\n• Implementation: Google began encouraging a mobile-first approach through initiatives like AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) and mobile-first indexing.\n• Outcome: Websites adopting Google’s mobile-first guidelines generally experienced improved mobile performance and search rankings. Google’s emphasis on mobile-friendly designs helped shape industry standards and practices.\n• Context: Dropbox transitioned from a desktop-centric service to a mobile-friendly platform to meet user demands for accessibility on-the-go.\n• Implementation: They adopted a mobile-first approach in redesigning their app, focusing on a simplified, intuitive interface for mobile users first and then scaling up for desktop users.\n• Outcome: The redesign led to a more consistent user experience across devices and contributed to increased mobile engagement and user satisfaction.\n• Context: The BBC needed to reach a global audience on various devices, particularly mobile phones, given the increasing consumption of news on the go.\n• Implementation: They adopted a mobile-first strategy for their website and apps, ensuring content was accessible and optimized for mobile devices.\n• Outcome: The BBC saw a significant improvement in mobile traffic and user engagement. Their responsive design approach also made it easier to manage content across multiple platforms.\n• Context: Flipkart, a major e-commerce company in India, recognized the growing trend of mobile commerce in the region.\n• Implementation: They adopted a mobile-first approach to design their app and website, focusing on fast load times, simplified navigation, and a user-friendly interface.\n• Outcome: This approach contributed to a surge in mobile transactions, with Flipkart reporting that a large majority of their sales came from mobile devices.\n• Context: Airbnb aimed to create a seamless experience for travelers and hosts who increasingly relied on mobile devices.\n• Implementation: They redesigned their platform with a mobile-first mindset, prioritizing mobile usability and a responsive design that adapted to various screen sizes.\n• Outcome: The mobile-first design contributed to higher user satisfaction, increased mobile bookings, and a more consistent user experience across devices .\n• Context: Spotify needed a mobile-friendly design to cater to users who accessed music primarily through mobile devices.\n• Implementation: Spotify embraced mobile-first design principles to ensure a seamless, intuitive user interface on mobile devices before adapting it for desktop users.\n• Outcome: This approach enhanced user engagement and satisfaction, with the majority of Spotify’s user base accessing the service via mobile devices.\n\nIf your site is good on a mobile device, it translates better to the rest of devices, be it tablet, desktop computer or laptop. More important, though, is that a mobile-first approach is also a content-first approach. Mobile has the most limitations, screen size, and bandwidth to name a few, and so designing within these parameters forces you to prioritize content ruthlessly.\n\nThe mobile-first approach organically leads to a design that’s more content-focused, and therefore user-focused. The heart of the site is content — that’s what the users are there for.\n\nOne caveat, though, is that mobile users sometimes require different content than desktop users. Device-specific content can be gauged by considering context — what, in a given situation and a given environment, will your user appreciate more. The best way to plan ahead for these is by creating user scenarios.\n\nAnother advantage to the mobile-first approach is that the small-screen breakpoints can better fit around the content. Again, the alternative is worse: having to squeeze an already plump design into a tiny framework. But with the mobile-first approach, the breakpoints develop naturally around content, so you don’t need any awkward edits.\n\nWe’ll describe a process that helps our designers at UXPin.\n\nAs usual, wireframing is a recommended early step to most efficiently structure your layout. When wireframing or prototyping, we use the responsive breakpoint menu to streamline the process of moving to different screen sizes, starting with the smallest.\n\nThese presets layout the proper screen size for you, so you can wireframe keeping only the content in mind.\n\nOur procedure follows these steps:\n\n1. Content Inventory — This is a spreadsheet or equivalent document containing all the elements you want to include. Learn more about doing an inventory of content.\n\n2. Visual Hierarchy — Prioritize the elements in the content inventory and determine how to display the most important elements prominently. Learn more about visual hierarchy.\n\n3. Design with the smallest breakpoints and then scale up — Build the mobile wireframe first, then use that as the model for larger breakpoints. Expand the screen until there’s too much negative space.\n\n4. Enlarge touch targets — Fingers are much wider than pixel-precise mouse cursors, and so need larger elements on which to tap. At the time of this writing, Apple recommends 44 pixels square for touch targets (read about mobile design for iOS and Android). Give hyperlinks plenty of space, and slightly enlarge buttons, and make sure that there’s enough space around all the interactive elements.\n\n5. Don’t count on hovers — It almost goes without saying, but designers often rely on hover and mouseover effects in their interactive work. If you’re thinking mobile-friendly, don’t do that.\n\n6. Think “app” — Mobile users are accustomed to the motion and a modicum of control in their experience. Think about off-canvas navigation, expandible widgets, AJAX calls, or other elements on the screen with which users can interact without refreshing the page.\n\n7. Avoid large graphics — Landscape photos and complex graphics don’t display well when your screen is only a few inches across. Cater to mobile users with images that are readable on handheld screens.\n\n8. Test it in a real device — Nothing beats discovering for yourself how usable a website is (or isn’t). Step away from your desktop or laptop computer and load up your product on a real phone or tablet. Tap through pages. Is the site easy to navigate? Does it load in a timely fashion? Are the text and graphics easy to read?\n\nThis is just a basic outline. For the complete guide to our process, download the free Content Wireframing for Responsive Design.\n\nWe prepared for you a tutorial that will explain how to create a mobile-first design. Our mobile-first design tutorial has four steps.\n\nA “mobile-first approach” differs from “desktop-first” in that we add information to each progressively larger layout rather than cut away as we design smaller. Thinking mobile doesn’t mean eliminating information. It means sorting information into primary, secondary, and tertiary content.\n\nIn this example, we know that the home page should have certain elements, like the company’s name and links to products. A blog post wouldn’t hurt either. But like we said, not everything will fit into a smartphone view, so we set priorities based on what will achieve the site’s goal: selling bikes.\n\nBased on that ordered list, we can create with the confidence that our work will solve a design problem of getting sales.\n\nHow much do users need?\n\nThinking mobile-first forces us to think about what’s really important. In this smartphone view, the top-selling bike and newest model will lead directly to sales, so can we leave other items — such as gift certificates, a less-popular model, the latest news — for inside pages. The final call to action is especially prominent and easy to hit with a single tap of the finger.\n\nAs we design for a tablet-sized view, we’re better able to add secondary information like additional products (e.g. “The Capacitor”). We can also expand the navigation at the top of the page and add content that encourages sales without actually leading to them — namely, the testimonial.\n\nBecause more options are available, this can be surprisingly more difficult than deciding what to include in a smartphone UI. The difference between secondary and tertiary elements is a blurry line, and temptation is strong to include everything.\n\nResist the urge. Use the ordered content list. Like smartphones, space is still limited.\n\nFinally, the desktop view can support as much information as you decide is important. This is where the home page can accommodate all of the information you see fit, whether or not it fits. Notice some of the additional content we’ve included:\n\nIf you’re using UXPin, it’s fairly easy to create different layouts for these views.\n• Tap “Add new adaptive version” at the bottom right of the UXPin editor.\n• Choose a preset size or enter your own dimensions.\n• You don’t have to recreate everything from scratch. Choose a size from which to copy your design’s elements.\n\n\n\nAnd that’s it. Switch between breakpoints by tapping the different sizes above your canvas, and adjust each to suit your needs. If you’d like to try prototyping mobile-first yourself, go ahead. Start a free trial in UXPin.\n\nThose of you who use UXPin Merge can use Frames to build fully responsive prototypes.\n• Select the Frame tool from the Quick Tools Bar.\n• Click anywhere on the canvas to create a default frame (300 x 100 px), or click and drag on the canvas to create a frame with custom dimensions.\n• Put code-backed components inside of Frame and manage their properties.\n\nYou can preview just a frame of full design in the Spec Mode. Frames in UXPin work similarly to iFrames but offer more flexibility for responsive design. They support dynamic resizing and styling which allows components to automatically adapt their appearance and behavior for different screen sizes, making it easy to ensure a responsive design across all devices. To see how it works exactly, request access to UXPin Merge."

        "document": "Webflow Enterprise gives your teams the power to build, ship, and manage sites collaboratively at scale.\n\nSmartphones and tablets are no longer merely accessories — these mobile devices are a primary gateway to the online world.\n\nWith most internet traffic now originating from mobile devices, designing for smaller screens isn’t just an option — it’s a requirement. To adapt to this surge, mobile-first design is crucial. This approach streamlines applications and provides fast-loading websites that cater to the ever-growing mobile audience and future-proofs your digital audience. Mobile-first design starts with optimizing the user experience for mobile devices before scaling up the design to larger screens, such as laptops and desktops. With this approach, developers and designers recognize the increasing prevalence of global mobile users. They strive to create websites and applications that captivate and function well on smaller screens so they can offer users seamless digital experiences regardless of the device. Two key principles of mobile-first design strategies are:\n• Progressive advancement. This principle centers on starting the design process with the most constrained platform — the mobile device. By focusing on the essential features required on the smallest screen, you target the core functionality of the site or app, such as intuitive navigation, fast loading times, and responsive design elements. These components remain a priority even as you scale the design up to larger screens, which lets you integrate additional features and more complex designs without compromising the mobile user experience.\n• Graceful degradation. In contrast, graceful degradation begins with designing for larger devices and then adapting the design to fit smaller screens. Under this approach, designs for larger devices are “degraded” in a controlled and strategic manner to fit the constraints of mobile devices. This ensures a robust desktop user experience that functions equally well when scaled to a mobile format. Mobile-first design isn’t just a trend — it’s a strategic approach to take on mobile-dominant markets. Here’s why you should embrace mobile-first layouts:\n• Increases user-centricity. Mobile-first designs emphasize user needs by tailoring core functionalities, such as navigation and design responsiveness, to the constraints of smaller screens. This focus increases usability and satisfaction for a growing population of mobile users.\n• Enhances performance optimization. Starting with mobile-first design compels organizations to optimize for performance from the onset. This includes improving loading times, performance, and responsiveness, which are crucial for mobile users who rely on cellular data and expect quick information access.\n• Adapts to a mobile-dominant market. A mobile-first design is essential to address the increasing number of users accessing the internet through smartphones and tablets. If you neglect mobile design, your brand risks alienating the many people who rely on smartphones and tablets for internet usage, leading to a loss of audience and potential revenue.\n• Fosters strategic and sustainable growth. Mobile optimization not only improves user experience and customer satisfaction, but also keeps digital assets relevant as more users shift toward smartphones and tablets.\n• Drives innovation. Embracing a mobile-first mindset encourages teams to adapt to changing user preferences and innovate within the constraints of mobile technology, leading to creative solutions that benefit users across all devices. What’s the difference between mobile-first and responsive design? Mobile-first and responsive design are both strategies for creating functional websites across devices, but they differ significantly in their starting point and implementation. Mobile-first design methodology centers on mobile devices from the start, shaping sites for optimal performance on smaller screens. Starting with mobile ensures that the website is quick to load and responsive on devices where users may have limited bandwidth or processing power. It also tailors the user interface and experience for mobile users, who may have different usage patterns and needs than desktop users. Responsive web design, in contrast, typically begins with a desktop version of a site that’s modified to adapt to smaller screens. By using flexible grids and layouts, responsive design ensures that websites will reconfigure themselves to provide a consistent experience whether users are on a desktop, tablet, or mobile. While this approach is versatile, it may result in a mobile experience that feels like an afterthought because the primary focus is on the desktop. In essence, while responsive design is about adaptability, mobile-first design is about intentionality — ensuring that the mobile user’s experience is not just accommodated but prioritized.\n\nDelivering effective mobile-first designs requires a combination of best practices across design, development, and testing. Here are some strategies to ensure your mobile-first designs make an impact. Most mobile users own touch-enabled smartphones, so you must tailor interactions to mobile gestures. Design with touch in mind, considering pinch, swipe, and tap actions. Ensure buttons and elements are appropriately sized and suitable for touch input, and implement haptic (vibration) feedback to improve the user experience and reduce frustration. For example, focus on large, tappable areas and intuitive swipe gestures instead of relying on desktop-centric hover effects. Keep menus simple, straightforward, and intuitive when designing for mobile. Prioritize core content, such as home, about us, and product pages, and remove unnecessary or heavy elements to help users find what they need without hassle or confusion. Consider collapsible elements, such as a hamburger menu, that expands and shrinks. This saves space and provides interactivity while keeping the layout clean and organized. With a limited canvas, you must create streamlined navigation that works around the limitations of smaller screens. For example, avoid sudden pop-ups that occupy most of the screen and disrupt the user experience. Speed and performance retain mobile users who expect quick access and seamless interactions. Optimize graphics, images, videos, and code to ensure fast page loading and swift response times. Doing so minimizes the load on browsers and servers and provides users with responsive webpages that enhance satisfaction and promote continued user engagement. To achieve this, actively compress images and implement responsive design techniques that allow text, images, calls to action (CTAs), and layouts to adjust fluidly across different screen sizes. This maintains the visual integrity of your interface and effectively translates your design to any device, preserving the user experience. Test your mobile designs under various conditions and scenarios to ensure they stand up to real-world use. Evaluate how your pages and apps perform across network speeds, device orientations, screen sizes, and hardware capabilities to confirm their resilience and adaptability. Additionally, use A/B testing to directly compare different design approaches and identify which is more effective. Incorporate user feedback when testing by gathering insights from the start of the design and development process. This proactive approach lets you collect valuable data on user behavior and preferences and refine your design to more closely align with user interests so you can ensure your mobile experience is functional and user-approved. Start small and scale up. When adopting a mobile-first strategy, start with the basics that work well on smartphones and tablets, then gradually add features and expand your design perspective as you have more space. Establish a robust framework that seamlessly accommodates various devices and screen sizes from the start to secure consistency across your digital ecosystem and set the stage for smooth scalability, helping ensure future growth. Continuing this strategy, focus on building a solid design system that caters to multiple devices and screen sizes and allows you to create a consistent and cohesive ecosystem. This prepares your online presence for long-term growth and facilitates smooth expansion over time. Shifting to a mobile-first approach presents challenges, but it’s a step worth taking to drive progression. While you may hesitate to break established workflows, you can adopt a strategy that targets a substantial amount of web traffic to ensure your brand remains accessible to your target audience and beyond.

        "document": "Mobile-first design means creating layouts with the mobile screens in mind first, then proceeding to larger screens. For implementation, designers choose the right visual hierarchy, make elements thumb-friendly, use visuals with optimized size, and more.\n\nRegarding how many people use mobile devices and for how long, a mobile-first design is critical to business success with your website or app.\n\nThis article discusses what mobile-first design is and how you can approach it to deliver the best user experience. Thanks to our expertise in creating mobile designs, we are eager to share insights on this. So, let’s see how you can implement this approach.\n\nAs the concept suggests, mobile-first design is when web designers start small and build their way up to a desktop version. This can be done by wireframing and prototyping for the smallest screens first and then moving to larger sizes.\n\nMaking mobile screens a priority is sensible. This way, a designer can include the core features first and add more fancy functionality for larger screen sizes. Such an approach is called progressive advancement.\n\nSeveral factors make mobile-first design vital to operating a business. They come from widespread mobile device usage.\n\nIn 2024, 94.1% of users worldwide accessed the internet using smartphones. This means a business can reach a wider audience by investing in the mobile version of their websites.\n\nSo, a significant portion of business and marketing endeavors went mobile. People view social media content, short videos, and podcasts on mobile devices. Content creators ensure user engagement and trust in your brand. This contributes to the use of social media ads by businesses that want to expand their online presence.\n\nFor example, smartphones create a stable flow of orders in retail. As of the third quarter of 2024, mobile devices generate 77% of retail website traffic worldwide. Also, 68% of online shopping orders were made via smartphones.\n\nRegarding these statistics, certain standards define the mobile appearance of the websites. For example, a mobile-friendly design is a must if you want your website to rank higher in search engines such as Google.\n\nCreating a mobile-first design takes specific practices that ensure captivating results. Such practices are used to create mobile versions of websites and in mobile app development services. The steps essential to make your design responsive and mobile-friendly are as follows:\n\nLet’s see in detail what they are.\n\nPerforming thorough research for design ensures that it will delight users. Careful planning is one of the factors for the project's success.\n\nThat is why, at Codica, we start designing mobile-friendly solutions from product discovery.\n\nDuring this step, the design team reviews the project's peculiarities, such as niche, target audience, features, and brand style. A vital part of the research is learning about end users’ problems and how the solution design can address them.\n\nThe step helps build a mobile-first design strategy to fulfill the requirements and tasks. At the end of the research, designers discuss their project vision with the client to align their views.\n\nBy the end of this stage, designers create clickable prototypes to present the solution’s look to the client and development team. We discuss them in the sections below.\n\nArmed with the research results, the designer creates the first sketches of the mobile-first design. These are wireframes presenting the layout of the future solution. It is like a draft map for a building, planning the placement of components.\n\nWireframes are typically drawn by hand or created with software tools. These include Balsamiq and Miro. You can also use apps that allow you to create a full design, like Figma and Sketch.\n\nSuch software can show several options for the same element, like options for placing a button. So, the designer can select the best path per the project aim and design practices.\n\nPeople engaged in UI/UX design services and development processes benefit from wireframes in several ways.\n\nOn the one hand, the client and project manager can check wireframes’ compliance with requirements.\n\nOn the other hand, developers get a preliminary view of how the elements are arranged. So they will get a clear picture of product development and give recommendations if necessary.\n\nCreating prototypes is the next step in getting closer to the final solution look. These visually present the solution elements and how they work together. The concept created with wireframes gets a single functional form. So, prototypes show how the solution will look and function.\n\nA SaaS solution for the bakery we created is a good illustration of how prototypes differ for mobile and desktop screens. This platform offers services to order cakes and other baked goodies. The solution helps users to view and select items, schedule orders, and receive quotes. Moreover, it allows a business owner to view key performance parameter metrics. They include orders, requests, and total order amounts.\n\nOur aim was to make the solution convenient for buyers and bakery owners. With this in mind, we included features with different accents in mobile and desktop versions.\n• Our designers created a desktop version adapted for cake-makers who mostly use desktop app to manage their orders and work with the platform.\n• For users who want to order the cake, we have created a mobile version since they mostly use their smartphones to find a cake-maker and book a cake.\n\nThis approach helped us deliver an equally rich user experience on both screen sizes and for both types of users.\n\nPreserving the functionality, we rearranged the elements in the mobile version. For example, we adjusted calendar features for mobile screens compared to vast placement on desktops.\n\nIn the prototype below, you can see the two design options for mobile and desktop screens. Note that the mobile version includes the same functionality as the desktop one. This brings convenience to users who prefer to look through the solution on their smartphone or tablet. They get the same versatile experience as desktop users using their mobile devices.\n\nThe basic principles of the mobile-first design process aim to optimize the layout with small screens first. Depending on this objective, designers rely on the principles that will bring the relevant result. Let’s see in more detail what those rules are.\n\nFor starters, what is visual hierarchy? It is the placement of design elements by their priority to guide the viewer’s eye through the solution design. It is reached by choosing the right element size, color, contrast, and arrangement.\n\nHere are the techniques that help build a visual hierarchy for users’ convenience:\n• Changing the sizing of elements, making them bigger or smaller regarding their priority;\n• Choosing fonts for websites and pairing them with varying widths and weights;\n• Using whitespace between elements to make the design visually clear.\n\nThese two design aspects, user interface (UI) and user experience (UX), are the pillars of smooth flow and customer engagement. It should be easy for customers to find and reach elements on the screen. For this, follow several fundamental principles:\n• Choose conventional element placement. For example, the navigation bar is expected to be in the upper right corner, whereas the most important buttons should be easy to reach.\n• Make clickable elements stand out and separate them with whitespace to avoid unwanted clicks. Google recommends that the width and height of clickable elements should be at least 48dp.\n• Select a font size that is readable on mobile screens. For example, Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines suggest that the text font should be between 14pt and 19pt.\n\nYou may also like: Top UI/UX Trends to Follow in 2025\n\nBefore deciding how to place elements in our design, we should consider the general rules of mobile device usage.\n\nThe survey shows that 49% of users hold their smartphones with one hand and use their thumb in 75% of interactions. The remaining users hold it cradled (36%) and with two hands (15%). So, users can reach certain zones of smartphones with more or less effort. The image below shows the areas you can quickly go with your thumb naturally, stretching or hard.\n\nThese data are used when creating the mobile first design with a suitable arrangement of primary and secondary elements. That is why designers try to place vital elements in the green zone of the mobile screen.\n\nFor example, not a long time ago, Apple introduced the Reachability feature. It lets users lower the upper part of the screen for easier accessibility. Thus, smartphone usage is made more comfortable for people with difficulty using apps or navigating the web. The video below shows how to activate it on the iPhone 14 Pro.\n\nThese are small dialogues used for informative or promotional purposes. They are also called interstitials. As Google puts it, interstitials and dialogues should not intrude on screens. This is because search engines will not be able to read the content. However, you can create unintrusive screen dialogues that cover only a part of the mobile screen.\n\nYou should design popups to be informative while also letting users quickly get rid of them. For example, with Popupsmart builder, you can create a popup that disappears when you tap outside it on the screen. Also, you can add a button to close a popup.\n\nGraphic elements influence your web solution performance. Why is it crucial? Because hindered loading speed can result in a high bounce rate. You have only 2.5 seconds to load the heaviest element on the page to make your solution user-friendly.\n\nFor optimizing graphics in your design, you can choose lightweight formats, such as PNG, JPEG, and GIF. Also, if any of your assets are huge in size, you can compress them. Compression of 70-90% gives a balanced result regarding weight and quality.\n\nFurther reading: Website Redesign: The Complete Guide and Recommendations\n\nAfter creating the design, the team proceeds to development. This stage involves bringing the solution to life by implementing essential features.\n\nThe frontend includes versatile interactive user experiences involving network connection with the backend. The frontend includes approaches to make the solution load fast with cookies, forms, animations, and more.\n\nFor this part, we use JavaScript, TypeScript, and React Native as proven technologies for reliability and scalability.\n\nThe backend side ensures the work of mobile solution functionality. At Codica, we use Ruby and Ruby on Rails to create the back end of mobile apps and websites. Along with that, we also use Node.js, which is perfect for data-intensive solutions.\n\nThe application programming interfaces (APIs) and integrations allow for communication between the frontend, the backend, and the database. Developers create scalable and secure mobile solutions by choosing the APIs with proper encryption.\n\nAt the same time, integrations enrich the solution with additional capabilities. For example, at Codica, we use Stripe for payments, Sendgrid for email delivery, and Twilio for communication.\n\nThis element of a mobile solution stores and handles large amounts of data to make them accessible to users. Databases help store and process information safely. The Codica team prefers PostgreSQL thanks to its extensibility and helpful features.\n\nTo sum up, the mobile app or website development process involves thorough work and close cooperation between the development team and designers. Such an approach ensures that the teams implement the principles of mobile-first design and requirements from a client.\n\nTo ensure the design is performant and works best for mobile, testing and quality assurance services are vital steps. Let’s discover how we can refine our mobile-first web solution with testing.\n\nBasically, the real device cloud environment provides thousands of screen sizes for mobile devices and desktops for testing. You can use this medium to check how your app or website design renders across different screens.\n\nOne such tool is LT Browser 2.0. It is free to use and provides special features for mobile-first and responsive testing. So, how can it help in testing? Let’s see.\n• 50+ screen sizes to help testers see how a website will render;\n• Simultaneous debugging for different viewports with specified devtools;\n• Hot reload support with automatic URL reload in different viewports;\n\nGenerally, A/B testing shows two options of a web solution element, such as a button, to different users simultaneously. So, you can see which variant brings more positive feedback and improves business metrics.\n\nFor example, Booking.com aimed to increase the conversion rate on mobile by improving the “availability calendar” feature. They observed that mobile users often abandoned the search process when checking room availability due to perceived complexity or poor usability of the calendar interface.\n\nTo test it with A/B, they set up two variants.\n• Variant 1. The existing calendar interface showed all available dates in a simple grid format, with a limited focus on guiding users through the selection process.\n• Variant 2. The redesigned calendar highlighted available dates dynamically as users selected check-in and check-out dates. It also included visual cues like price ranges for specific dates and color-coded availability.\n\nNext, Booking.com tracked metrics, such as:\n\nIn conclusion, this test showed that:\n\nAs a result, Booking.com adopted the updated version site-wide, reinforcing the importance of data-driven A/B testing to enhance the mobile user experience.\n\nThis is the final step in finishing the testing phase. Usability testing is conducted with real users who are the target audience of your website or app.\n\nDuring these tests, you can ask users in person. Another option is to send them a questionnaire and get their results later. Usability testing uncovers peculiarities of users’ interaction with design elements. So you can choose the right path to improve your website or app relying on usability principles.\n\nBy the way, you can discover more about each of the above-listed stages of creating a design in our exciting guide to mobile app development.\n\nSeeing real-life examples is the best way to understand how mobile-first design works. Let’s discover what they are and how they implemented a mobile-first approach.\n\nThis is an eco-friendly company offering temperature-insulated packaging. With its website design and content, the company promotes its vision.\n\nThey efficiently use design hierarchy and CTAs on their first page.\n• The first CTA, Get a Quote, takes visitors directly to the company.\n• The second CTA, How It Works, is less visible and refers to how the packaging process goes. Putting their contact information in the upper part helps visitors easily connect with the company.\n\nThe company offers a full cycle of services in making prints. They engage talented artists to open their stores and create unique collections for customers. So, they have the mobile space to present print samples from various artists.\n\nThe Chinese restaurant website starts with a logo and a fully branded page. The design then leads to two main things: menu and order online. A minimalistic approach to placing elements helps users to reach their goals easily.\n\nWith specific UI/UX tools, you can make it easy to create mobile-first designs. The tools help create and test the vital aspects of your solution. So, let’s see which tools you can use for mobile-first design.\n\nWith Justinmind, you can create high-fidelity and interactive prototypes. It offers over 500 ready-made UI elements, basic interactions, screens, and prototypes.\n\nJustinmind provides a full range of interactions both for desktop and mobile screens. So, you can simulate swiping, tapping, scrolling, and pinching with the tool. Also, you can test the prototypes for responsiveness and motion on simulators of iPhone, iPad, and Android devices.\n\nIn design, Figma is the ultimate tool with which you can do everything. You can create prototypes and design websites, choosing from numerous screen sizes that depict how the web page will look.\n\nBesides, it has features for brainstorming with FigJam and team collaboration. Also, Figma allows developers easy access to layouts so they know how to implement the design.\n\nThis lightweight solution optimizes images for mobile-first design. It detects the device’s screen size and then adapts the image with the best resolution. With the tool, you can automatically see the device's screen size, reduce the image size, and customize image quality. You can use this tool for free as it is an open-source project on GitHub.\n\nIt is a tool to validate that your design performs well on mobile devices. It checks vital characteristics like loading speed, responsiveness, and usability. As a result, you get detailed reports with data and recommendations on improving your web solution. The tool is free. You can insert a URL of your website to check it with the test.\n\nThe mobile-first approach is the future of web design. This approach brings an excellent experience to your users. So, it is one of the best investments you can make for your business. Let’s see what benefits you can get with mobile first design.\n\nAs mobile-first design prioritizes small screens, you think of the core elements initially. Deciding on the components and content this way makes your solution consistent and intuitive for users.\n\nIn Q3 2024, mobile devices generated 63.4% of global website traffic. This is a steady increase during the past 8 years. So, when you consider mobile design your priority, you cater to your target audience. Thus, you get more traffic to your solution.\n\nThe loading speed and mobile-friendliness are two characteristics that Google rewards. Thanks to them, solutions rank higher on the search engine result page (SERP). With a mobile-first approach, your page will load faster, ranking higher in browsers.\n\nNearly half of smartphone users spend 5-6 hours daily on their devices. That’s because you can use them on the go and view information casually. A mobile-first design will compel users to visit your website or download your app.\n\nBillions of people use social media globally,, and a significant share of those users use their smartphones. For example, YouTube sees twice as many mobile users on different pages than desktop users.\n\nThis means that people interested in social media ads will likely arrive at your website's mobile version. A mobile first web design will delight them with a refined experience creating an excellent first impression of your brand.\n\nIn Codica’s expertise, we have had several projects where a mobile version was a priority for our clients. At the product discovery stage, our team learned that users would prefer a mobile design. So, we started the design for mobile devices first and then proceeded to the desktop version.\n\nThis is how we created a fitness progressive web application for Impact. It is a lightweight app that connects users and their personal trainers. Thanks to the PWA technology, the app is light and stable, processing a large amount of data. The app includes 400+ exercises, and customers performed 2000+ workouts with the app.\n\nSeamless user experience design helps users navigate through the app and select their programs for workouts and nutrition with different parameters and categories. For example, you can enter your starting weight and goal, and the app will show your progress while you use the app over time. Also, the design includes interactive elements, such as checking if a user has reached their daily goals.\n\nMobile-first design holds many aspects critical to delivering a refined user experience. Designers consider the element arrangement and keep accessibility in mind. They also think of how people hold smartphones to reach the needed areas. With this approach, mobile solutions become functional and easy to use.\n\nAs smartphones are widely used, thinking over mobile design is critical for a business to thrive. This approach ensures that your solution delights users with appeal and convenience. So, you reach a broad audience with a mobile solution and get opportunities for mobile promotion.\n\nWe are eager to create a mobile-first design if you have a project in mind.

        "document": "Let's examine a typical scenario. A typical website may contain a header image and some content images below the header. The header image will likely span the whole of the width of the header, and the content image will fit somewhere inside the content column. Here's an example: This works well on a wide screen device, such as a laptop or desktop (you can see the example live and find the source code on GitHub.) We won't discuss the CSS much in this lesson, except to say that:\n• The body content has been set to a maximum width of 1200 pixels — in viewports above that width, the body remains at 1200px and centers itself in the available space. In viewports below that width, the body will stay at 100% of the width of the viewport.\n• The header image has been set so that its center always stays in the center of the header, no matter what width the heading is set at. If the site is being viewed on a narrower screen, the important detail in the center of the image (the people) can still be seen, and the excess is lost off either side. It is 200px high.\n• The content images have been set so that if the body element becomes smaller than the image, the images start to shrink so that they always stay inside the body, rather than overflowing it. However, issues arise when you start to view the site on a narrow screen device. The header below looks OK, but it's starting to take up a lot of the screen height for a mobile device. And at this size, it is difficult to see faces of the two people within the first content image. An improvement would be to display a cropped version of the image which displays the important details of the image when the site is viewed on a narrow screen. A second cropped image could be displayed for a medium-width screen device, like a tablet. The general problem whereby you want to serve different cropped images in that way, for various layouts, is commonly known as the art direction problem. In addition, there is no need to embed such large images on the page if it is being viewed on a mobile screen. Doing so can waste bandwidth; in particular, mobile users don't want to waste bandwidth by downloading a large image intended for desktop users, when a small image would do for their device. Conversely, a small raster image starts to look grainy when displayed larger than its original size (a raster image is a set number of pixels wide and a set number of pixels tall). Ideally, multiple resolutions would be made available to the user's web browser. The browser could then determine the optimal resolution to load based on the screen size of the user's device. This is called the resolution switching problem. To make things more complicated, some devices have high resolution screens that need larger images than you might expect to display nicely. This is essentially the same problem, but in a slightly different context. You might think that vector images would solve these problems, and they do to a certain degree — they are small in file size and scale well, and you should use them wherever possible. However, they aren't suitable for all image types. Vector images are great for simple graphics, patterns, interface elements, etc., but it starts to get very complex to create a vector-based image with the kind of detail that you'd find in say, a photo. Raster image formats such as JPEGs are more suited to the kind of images we see in the above example. This kind of problem didn't exist when the web first existed, in the early to mid 90s — back then the only devices in existence to browse the Web were desktops and laptops, so browser engineers and spec writers didn't even think to implement solutions. Responsive image technologies were implemented recently to solve the problems indicated above by letting you offer the browser several image files, either all showing the same thing but containing different numbers of pixels (resolution switching), or different images suitable for different space allocations (art direction). Note: The new features discussed in this article — / / — are all supported in modern desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nSo, what is the problem that we want to solve with resolution switching? We want to display identical image content, just larger or smaller depending on the device — this is the situation we have with the second content image in our example. The standard element traditionally only lets you point the browser to a single source file: We can however use two attributes — and — to provide several additional source images along with hints to help the browser pick the right one. You can see an example of this in our responsive.html example on GitHub (see also the source code): The and attributes look complicated, but they're not too hard to understand if you format them as shown above, with a different part of the attribute value on each line. Each value contains a comma-separated list, and each part of those lists is made up of three sub-parts. Let's run through the contents of each now: defines the set of images we will allow the browser to choose between, and what size each image is. Each set of image information is separated from the previous one by a comma. For each one, we write:\n• The image's intrinsic width in pixels ( ) — note that this uses the unit, not as you might expect. An image's intrinsic size is its real size, which can be found by inspecting the image file on your computer (for example, on a Mac you can select the image in Finder and press + to bring up the info screen). defines a set of media conditions (e.g. screen widths) and indicates what image size would be best to choose, when certain media conditions are true — these are the hints we talked about earlier. In this case, before each comma we write:\n• A media condition ( ) — you'll learn more about these in the CSS topic, but for now let's just say that a media condition describes a possible state that the screen can be in. In this case, we are saying \"when the viewport width is 600 pixels or less\".\n• The width of the slot the image will fill when the media condition is true ( ) Note: In , you can use any length value. For example, rather than providing an absolute width (for example, ), you can alternatively provide a width relative to the viewport (for example, ). However, you cannot use a percentage as the slot width. You may have noticed that the last slot width has no media condition (this is the default that is chosen when none of the media conditions are true). The browser ignores everything after the first matching condition, so be careful how you order the media conditions. So, with these attributes in place, the browser will:\n• Look at screen size, pixel density, zoom level, screen orientation, and network speed.\n• Work out which media condition in the list is the first one to be true.\n• Look at the slot size given to that media query.\n• Load the image referenced in the list that has the same size as the slot or, if there isn't one, the first image that is bigger than the chosen slot size. And that's it! At this point, if a supporting browser with a viewport width of 480px loads the page, the media condition will be true, and so the browser chooses the slot. The will be loaded, as its inherent width ( ) is closest to the slot size. The 800px picture is 128KB on disk, whereas the 480px version is only 63KB — a saving of 65KB. Now, imagine if this was a page that had many pictures on it. Using this technique could save mobile users a lot of bandwidth. Note: When testing this with a desktop browser, if the browser fails to load the narrower images when you've got its window set to the narrowest width, have a look at what the viewport is (you can approximate it by going into the browser's JavaScript console and typing in ). Different browsers have minimum sizes that they'll let you reduce the window width to, and they might be wider than you'd think. When testing it with a mobile browser, you can use tools like Firefox's page to inspect the page loaded on the mobile using the desktop developer tools. To see which images were loaded, you can use Firefox DevTools's Network Monitor tab or Chrome DevTools's Network panel. For Chrome, you may also want to disable cache to prevent it from picking already downloaded images. Older browsers that don't support these features will just ignore them. Instead, those browsers will go ahead and load the image referenced in the attribute as normal. Note: In the of the example linked above, you'll find the line : this forces mobile browsers to adopt their real viewport width for loading web pages (some mobile browsers lie about their viewport width, and instead load pages at a larger viewport width then shrink the loaded page down, which is not very helpful for responsive images or design).\n\nSuppose you have an image that will be rendered at the same real-world size on displays that have different screen resolutions. You can provide a better user experience on high resolution displays by serving a higher resolution version of the image. To achieve this you can allow the browser to choose an appropriate resolution image by using with x-descriptors and without — a somewhat easier syntax! You can find an example of what this looks like in srcset-resolutions.html (see also the source code): Note that even though the image is always displayed with the same size, on higher resolution displays you get to see more details. In this example, the following CSS is applied to the image so that it will have a width of 320 pixels on the screen (also called CSS pixels): In this case, is not needed — the browser works out what resolution the display is that it is being shown on, and serves the most appropriate image referenced in the . So if the device accessing the page has a standard/low resolution display, with one device pixel representing each CSS pixel, the image will be loaded (the 1x is implied, so you don't need to include it.) If the device has a high resolution of two device pixels per CSS pixel or more, the image will be loaded. The 640px image is 93KB, whereas the 320px image is only 39KB."

        "document": "What Are Responsive Images and 6 Useful Techniques\n\nResponsive images are images that are designed to adjust their size and resolution based on the size of the device or screen they are being viewed on. This allows images to look sharp and clear on any screen, whether it’s a small smartphone screen or a large desktop monitor. This is achieved by using different versions of the same image with varying resolutions, and using CSS or JavaScript to determine which version to serve based on the screen size.\n\nThis is part of an extensive series of guides about front-end development.\n\nResponsive images are a part of responsive web design, which is a design approach aimed at creating websites that provide an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices and screen sizes. In responsive web design, the layout, content, and images of a website are flexible and adjust to the size of the device being used, allowing the website to be easily viewed on any device without the need for scrolling or zooming. Responsive images play a critical role in ensuring that images on a website look good on all devices and do not slow down the website’s loading time.\n\nBy using responsive images, website developers can ensure that images are appropriately sized for the device they are being viewed on, resulting in a better user experience.\n\nWhy Should You Use Responsive Images?\n\nResponsive images are useful for websites for several reasons:\n• Increased loading speed: They help to increase the loading speed of a website by serving optimized images that are appropriate for the size and resolution of the device being used. This means that images are smaller in size, which results in faster loading times and a better user experience.\n• Better user experience: They provide a better user experience by ensuring that images look good and are easily readable on any device. This is particularly important for mobile users, who are more likely to leave a website if it takes too long to load or if images are not optimized for their device.\n• Stronger SEO: Responsive images can also help to improve a website’s search engine optimization (SEO) by reducing the bounce rate (the number of visitors who leave a website after only viewing one page). Search engines use the bounce rate as a metric for measuring the quality of a website, so a lower bounce rate can result in higher search engine rankings.\n\nResponsive Images in HTML and CSS: 6 Useful Techniques\n\nThe and attributes are HTML attributes that are used to specify different versions of an image to be used based on the screen size and resolution of the device being used to view the website.\n\nThe attribute is used to specify a list of different versions of an image and their respective widths, and it is used in conjunction with the attribute. For example:\n\nIn this example, the attribute specifies three different versions of the image: , , and . The attribute specifies the maximum width of the screen that each version of the image is intended for.\n\nThe browser will choose the most appropriate image to display based on the size and resolution of the device being used to view the website. This helps to ensure that images are optimized for the device being used, resulting in faster loading times and a better user experience.\n\nWe will use the following images for testing:\n\nThe output should look like this: when tested with the browser, we can check see it is automatically resized per the selected device.\n\nMedia queries are used in CSS to apply different styles to a web page based on the size and resolution of the device being used to view the website. They can be included in HTML by adding CSS rules within media query blocks in the stylesheet.\n\nHere is an example of how to include media queries in a CSS stylesheet:\n\nIn the following output image, you can see the image is automatically resized depending on the device’s resolution.\n\nIn this example, the default styles are applied to all devices, and the media queries are used to override these styles for specific screen sizes:\n• The first media query sets styles for small screens (with a maximum width of 320 pixels),\n• The second media query sets styles for medium screens (with a minimum width of 321 pixels and a maximum width of 640 pixels)\n• The third media query sets styles for large screens (with a minimum width of 641 pixels)\n\nIn this way, media queries allow you to create responsive designs that adapt to the size and resolution of the device being used to view the website, resulting in a better user experience for all users.\n\nLearn more in our detailed guide to responsive images with CSS.\n\nBreakpoints are the specific width values that are used in media queries to apply different styles to a web page based on the size of the device being used to view the website. A breakpoint is the point at which the layout of a web page changes to accommodate the different screen size.\n\nBreakpoints are typically defined in pixels, and they are used to create a responsive design that adjusts to different screen sizes. Here are some examples of common breakpoints:\n• 320px: This is a popular option for small screens, such as those used on smartphones.\n• 640px: Commonly used for medium-sized screens, such as tablets.\n• 960px: Commonly used for large screens, such as desktop computers.\n• 1200px: Commonly used for extra-large screens, such as wide-screen monitors.\n\nThe property is a CSS property that sets the maximum width of an element. It can be used to prevent an element from becoming too wide when viewed on larger screens, which can help to ensure that the layout of a web page remains consistent and readable on all devices.\n\nIn this example, the property is used to set the maximum width of all elements on the page to 100% of the width of their parent container. This means that the images will be resized to fit within the available space, but they will never become wider than the parent container.\n\nLazy loading is a technique for optimizing the loading of images on a web page. In the context of responsive images, lazy loading means that images are only loaded when they are needed, and not when the page first loads.\n\nWith lazy loading, images are only loaded when they are in or near the viewport, which is the portion of the web page that is currently visible on the screen. This can significantly improve the loading time of a web page, especially on mobile devices, where network speeds are often slower.\n\nHere is an example of how to implement lazy loading for images in HTML using JavaScript:\n\nIn this example, the attribute is used to store the URL of the image, and the class is used to select all images that need to be lazy loaded.\n\nThe IntersectionObserver API is used to detect when an image enters the viewport, and the attribute is updated with the URL of the image. This means that the image is only loaded when it is needed, and not when the page first loads.\n\nA responsive image background is an image that is set as the background of an element on a web page, and is designed to adjust its size and appearance based on the size of the device or screen being used to view the page. This means that the background image will scale and adjust its position to fit the available screen space, providing an optimal viewing experience for the user regardless of the device they are using.\n\nResponsive image backgrounds are often set using CSS, and may use media queries to serve different versions of the same image based on the size of the device. The goal of a responsive image background is to provide a seamless and visually appealing design, regardless of the device being used to view the web page. By using responsive image backgrounds, website developers can ensure that the background images on their pages look good on all devices and do not slow down the website’s loading time.\n\nImplementing responsive images in WordPress is relatively straightforward. WordPress automatically generates several different sizes of each image that is uploaded to the media library. These sizes can be used to serve optimized images based on the size and resolution of the device being used to view the website.\n\nThe available image sizes can be configured in the WordPress settings, and they can also be added or modified using custom code. By default, the large image version will have maximum dimensions of 1024 pixels, while the smallest (thumbnail) image size will have maximum dimensions of 150 pixels.\n\nIn WordPress, the attribute is generated automatically for each image that is uploaded to the media library, and it can be used to serve optimized images based on the size and resolution of the device being used to view the website.\n\nHere is an example of how to implement responsive images in WordPress. Please note that this example requires that the image has the string ‘ ’ in its filename.\n\nIn this example, the function is used to get the URL of the full-sized image, and the function is used to get the attribute for the image. The attribute is used to specify the maximum width of the screen that each version of the image is intended for.\n\nRelated content: Read our blog on how to create responsive image for WordPress.\n\nBootstrap is a popular front-end framework for developing responsive, mobile-first websites. It provides a set of CSS and JavaScript-based components and tools that make it easy to create responsive designs that look good on a variety of devices.\n\nIn Bootstrap, responsive images can be implemented using the class. This class is used to make images scalable and responsive, so that they will automatically adjust their size and resolution based on the size and resolution of the device being used to view the website.\n\nHere is an example of how to implement responsive images in Bootstrap:\n\nIn this example, the element is given the class, which makes the image scalable and responsive. The attribute is used to provide a text description of the image for accessibility purposes.\n\nA cloud-based service for managing images and videos, Cloudinary offers a generous free-forever subscription plan.
