        "document": "I’ve talked here about disabling boosting in other threads via adjusting the max state to 99%. The flaw with this method is capping the CPU at only 1.7GHz. To maintain stock 2.9/3.0GHz clock with boosting disabled, use this method below instead of 99% max power state.\n\nUsing Registry Editor, go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Contro l\\Power\\PowerSettings\\54533251-82be-4824-96c1-47b60b740d00\\be337238-0d82-4146-a960-4f3749d470c7 and select Attributes. Modify the value of \"Attributes\" from 1 to 2. Data should read “0x00000002 (2)”. This will uncover a hidden power option.\n\nAfter that, go back in the Power Plan Options and a new tab \"Processor Performance Boost Mode\" will appear. Set it to Disable and click Apply. Also, make sure your max processor state is at 100%. The CPU will now run on the stock frequency.\n\nFor a general idea about the performance compared to 99% max state, average FPS went up to about 5-15 with the temperatures still maxing out at the same 75 degree Celsius! The FPS loss from 99% disabled has been recovered while maintaining the benefit! Tiering your games at 1.7GHz, 3.0GHz, and full boosting will allow greater flexible for performance and temperature.\n\nNote: I have the 240Hz G15, but this should be similar performance to the G14.\n\nCredits to deenoekun here for the find"

        "document": "After the latest engine release my game became near unplayable, despite running smoothly for years. Initially I thought that it would just take time to recompile shaders and everything would fix on it's own, but after playing for 3 straight days that didn't happen.\n\nMy PC is a 4790k, 8GB RAM, GTX 970 using Vulkan renderer, Steam POE version - pretty old by today's standards, however, I couldn't understand why performance tanked by around 3 times for a patch that didn't perceptibly improve visuals, so I started tinkering. Took a while, but now performance for me is back to where it was pre-patch and I can play smoothly, so i'll share the steps that worked for me. Before you start, you may want to update your graphics drivers if you've been holding off, as we'll be recompiling shaders anyway so there's no better time to do it.\n• Limit FPS and render rate - I usually ran the game around 60 FPS stable on the lowest settings for juiced delirium maps, so I figured limiting FPS and GPU render rate to 60 would make sense to keep things stable. This will vary based on your setup and how much FPS on average your rig can pump out, so you'll have to gauge it yourself if you want to minmax it. Go to Nvidia control panel -> Manage 3D Settings -> Program Settings -> PathOfExile_x64Steam.exe (or other depending what you use) -> Set Max Frame Rate to 60. Scroll down and set Vertical Sync. If you have a 144HZ monitor, set it to Adaptive(Half Refresh Rate). If you have a 60 HZ monitor, set it to On.\n\nThe next step will be recompiling new, proper shaders for both POE and NVIDIA/AMD. This will vary somewhat based on your hard drive setup and type. I personally have 2 SSDs, one for system and one for storage/games, but i'll try to include steps for other setups.\n• First things first, if you are using Steam version of POE, go to Steam Settings -> Downloads -> Scroll down to Shader pre-caching and Disable both options there. We want the game to generate new shaders for our setup, not download precached ones.\n• Go to NVIDIA control panel -> Manage 3D Settings -> Global Settings -> Scroll down to Shader Cache Size and set it to 10GB or 100GB. If you have a lot of space on your SSD, you can set it to unlimited, however I did not find NVIDIA to generate a shader file larger than 10GB for PoE. While you're there, scroll down to Power Management Mode and select Prefer Maximum Performance.\n• Log in to Path of Exile and go to Options. You should now set all the video options you usually want to play with or which your computer can handle - I set everything to low. Make sure you set the correct native resolution you want to play at. Again I used Vulkan renderer, this one seemed to have the most stable performance for me. Limit Foreground FPS to the same number you did in the control panel - in my case it was 60. Vsync here you can leave off because we forced it though the NVIDIA control panel. Enable Triple Buffering, this helped me with FPS. Disable both Dynamic Culling and Dynamic Resolution for now. We will keep these disabled until we're finished with shader generation and can play smoothly again. Once you're done with settings, save and exit the game.\n• We're going to completely delete all cached POE shaders: a) Go to and delete everything in the folder, or delete the folder itself. b) If you're using Steam, go to \\Steam\\steamapps\\shadercache and delete everything from the folder. Then go to and delete the folders related to shaders. Don't delete the folders named Art,Bundles2,FMOD,logs,Redist.\n• Now we're going to delete cached NVIDIA/AMD shaders. a) Go to , depending on your GPU. Delete the GLCache folder, this is the Vulkan/OpenGL shaders that your graphics driver generates. The DXCache folder is the DirectX shaders. You probably won't be able to delete the folder itself because it is in use by Windows right now, but you can open the folder, click CTRL+A to select all files and delete the files themselves. This will delete all of the cached Path of Exile DirectX shaders generated by your graphics drivers. Some files will be in use, but since you don't have POE open they're unrelated, so just skip any deletion of files in use.\n• We're going to move the shader directories to a new location in an effort to improve performance. The priority goes like this: You want your shader directory to be located on an SSD which is not the system drive. So if you run 2 SSDs or 2HDDs, you'd want to to be on your other drive that isn't the system one. If you have 1 HDD 1 SSD, you'd want it to be on the SSD. If you only run 1 drive on your computer, you can skip this step. I personally have 2 SSDs - a C:\\ system drive with Windows on it, and a D drive that has movies and other stuff. a) Go to your other drive and create a folder named POESHADER. In my case I created b) Open . Scroll down to [GENERAL] and add a new line that specifies the new directory you created. In my case it was: . Save and exit the file. c) Open the POESHADER directory and create a new folder named DRIVER. Open the DRIVER folder and create two more new folders named DXCache and GLCache respectively . This will house the shaders generated by your graphics card. d) In the search bar type cmd, right click Command Prompt and open as administrator.Once the application is open, type the following line (make sure to change the drive letters, user path and NVIDIA or AMD folder, that's correct for your computer): You should see a confirmation that a symbolic link was created. Basically what this does is stores Vulkan/OpenGL shaders generated by your graphics driver in the new directory you created, while not impacting any functionality at all. e) If you use DirectX instead of Vulkan - you'll also need to do the same thing for the DXCache folder, however, it is currently in use. There's 2 ways to get around this: Open Task Manager and terminate Explorer.exe, and close all other apps that uses GPU like Chrome. Alt tab back to the command line. First, you'll need to delete the old DXCache directory that we left up because it was in use (again pay attention to the code and modify as appropriate): then perform the above step in the command line for the DXCache directory (again pay attention to the code and modify as appropriate): If you're unable to get it working, you can boot up Windows in Safe Mode with Networking, this disables any GPU rendering and you'll be able to execute the above 2 lines guaranteed. Once you're successful, all shaders will now be stored in your new drive.\n• This step will remove all of the Xbox Game Bar Apps from Windows. If you use them or want to keep them, skip this step, but I found it improved stability noticeably for me personally. Type in \"powershell\" into windows search, right click Windows Powershell and open as administrator. Once inside Powershell, execute the following command: Now type \"regedit\" into search and open the Registry Editor as administrator. Navigate to , double click the \"value\" file and set it's value to 0. Exit the registry editor.\n• Go to \"Game Bar Settings\" in Windows (use search) and Turn On game mode. I recommend experimenting with this yourself and see if you get any difference, as people have mixed experiences with this feature. I noticed this had a minimal positive impact on frame stutters for me without any loss in performance.\n• Restart your computer. You can now load up Path of Exile and get ingame. Be warned that since we deleted all of the shaders, they will now all have to be recompiled, so don't fret if you see your CPU and GPU maxxing out, as this is normal. Shaders will be compiled in each zone you enter, multiple times per zone depending on the content (delirium altars mobs etc). All you have to do now is play the game until you've recompiled all shaders, which will take hours and probably a hundred maps or so. During this time your performance won't be optimal because you're computer is calculating the shaders, however, even with zero shaders generated I noticed around 2-3x the performance I had before I did the above steps, so it was pretty much immediatelly playable for me. You can enter a map, fullclear it, and then wait for the shaders to stop compiling (wait until the Shader bar stops being full green in the POE performance graph). When they're done try to gauge the performance, frame time and stability, whether it improved or not. Once you have played for a day or two and have generated most of the shaders for all of the content ingame, feel free to re-enable Dynamic Culling and Dynamic Resolution if you like using those options for even more FPS.\n\nAnyway, that's all I did and now I can play smoothly again, my FPS and frame time doubled, hope this stuff helps someone fix they're performance (until the next engine update ofcourse :)"

On other hand I just recalled: but you need to restart PC I think so it cannot be dynamically used per game etc. that SUCKS! In this era, why GPU manufacturers don't allow this to be controlled via overclocking software? So inefficient! But they want you obviously to not be able to do this! Even like CPU overclocking: it is so bad, that you have to run at constant clocks and increase TDP considerably, if it could be turned on dynamically that would be great, but BIOS doesn't allow this level of communication between CPU and Windows even if you switch power plans these C-states interfere with overclocks... Not sure if this is not problem also of architecture maybe it is not possible even to turn on/off dynamically in Windows... So most overclockers will use manual overclocks running at constant speed, which is not very ecological - so bad! Just find it kinda stupid we don't have anything better in this age, everyone will just run 5ghz overclock on max frequency... Also WTF 4070 consumes like 470TDP!!! That is crazy! https://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/c ... ve_slopes/ . But this might still decrease input lag dunno! Also heard something putting GPU fan to over 80%+ which could be quite loud, not sure if it helps! Or about GPUs like to run hot over 80C on some news/OC site, but that might be just gimmick of some older architecture! Today GPUs thermal throttle a lot! I think at 76 already, or 80 or so, that's why undervolting actually can increase max frequency, or because power limits! But all are triple fan today so that's probably pointless thing today..."
