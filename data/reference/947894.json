        "document": "A Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) is a hardware feature that handles communication (i.e., timing requirements and data framing) using widely-adopted asynchronous serial communication interfaces, such as RS232, RS422, and RS485. A UART provides a widely adopted and cheap method to realize full-duplex or half-duplex data exchange among different devices. The ESP32 chip has 3 UART controllers (also referred to as port), each featuring an identical set of registers to simplify programming and for more flexibility. Each UART controller is independently configurable with parameters such as baud rate, data bit length, bit ordering, number of stop bits, parity bit, etc. All the regular UART controllers are compatible with UART-enabled devices from various manufacturers and can also support Infrared Data Association (IrDA) protocols.\n\nThe overview describes how to establish communication between an ESP32 and other UART devices using the functions and data types of the UART driver. A typical programming workflow is broken down into the sections provided below:\n• None Deleting a Driver - Freeing allocated resources if a UART communication is no longer required Steps 1 to 3 comprise the configuration stage. Step 4 is where the UART starts operating. Steps 5 and 6 are optional. The UART driver's functions identify each of the UART controllers using . This identification is needed for all the following function calls. UART communication parameters can be configured all in a single step or individually in multiple steps. Call the function and pass to it a structure. The structure should contain all the required parameters. See the example below. For more information on how to configure the hardware flow control options, please refer to peripherals/uart/uart_echo. Configure specific parameters individually by calling a dedicated function from the table given below. These functions are also useful if re-configuring a single parameter. Each of the above functions has a counterpart to check the currently set value. For example, to check the current baud rate value, call . After setting communication parameters, configure the physical GPIO pins to which the other UART device will be connected. For this, call the function and specify the GPIO pin numbers to which the driver should route the TX, RX, RTS, and CTS signals. If you want to keep a currently allocated pin number for a specific signal, pass the macro . The same macro should be specified for pins that will not be used. Once the communication pins are set, install the driver by calling and specify the following parameters: The function allocates the required internal resources for the UART driver. // Install UART driver using an event queue here \\ Once this step is complete, you can connect the external UART device and check the communication. Serial communication is controlled by each UART controller's finite state machine (FSM). The process of sending data involves the following steps: The process of receiving data is similar, but the steps are reversed:\n• None FSM processes an incoming serial stream and parallelizes it Therefore, an application only writes and reads data from a specific buffer using and respectively, and the FSM does the rest. After preparing the data for transmission, call the function and pass the data buffer's address and data length to it. The function copies the data to the TX ring buffer (either immediately or after enough space is available), and then exit. When there is free space in the TX FIFO buffer, an interrupt service routine (ISR) moves the data from the TX ring buffer to the TX FIFO buffer in the background. The code below demonstrates the use of this function. The function is similar to but adds a serial break signal at the end of the transmission. A 'serial break signal' means holding the TX line low for a period longer than one data frame. Another function for writing data to the TX FIFO buffer is . Unlike , this function does not block until space is available. Instead, it writes all data which can immediately fit into the hardware TX FIFO, and then return the number of bytes that were written. There is a 'companion' function that monitors the status of the TX FIFO buffer and returns once it is empty. // Wait for packet to be sent Once the data is received by the UART and saved in the RX FIFO buffer, it needs to be retrieved using the function . Before reading data, you can check the number of bytes available in the RX FIFO buffer by calling . An example of using these functions is given below. If the data in the RX FIFO buffer is no longer needed, you can clear the buffer by calling . If the hardware flow control is disabled, you can manually set the RTS and DTR signal levels by using the functions and respectively. The UART controller supports a number of communication modes. A mode can be selected using the function . Once a specific mode is selected, the UART driver handles the behavior of a connected UART device accordingly. As an example, it can control the RS485 driver chip using the RTS line to allow half-duplex RS485 communication. There are many interrupts that can be generated depending on specific UART states or detected errors. The full list of available interrupts is provided in ESP32 Technical Reference Manual > UART Controller (UART) > UART Interrupts and UHCI Interrupts [PDF]. You can enable or disable specific interrupts by calling or respectively. The function installs the driver's internal interrupt handler to manage the TX and RX ring buffers and provides high-level API functions like events (see below). The API provides a convenient way to handle specific interrupts discussed in this document by wrapping them into dedicated functions:\n• None Event detection: There are several events defined in that may be reported to a user application using the FreeRTOS queue functionality. You can enable this functionality when calling described in Install Drivers. An example of using Event detection can be found in peripherals/uart/uart_events.\n• None FIFO space threshold or transmission timeout reached: The TX and RX FIFO buffers can trigger an interrupt when they are filled with a specific number of characters, or on a timeout of sending or receiving data. To use these interrupts, do the following:\n• None Configure respective threshold values of the buffer length and timeout by entering them in the structure and calling\n• None Enable the interrupts using the functions and\n• None Disable these interrupts using the corresponding functions or\n• None Pattern detection: An interrupt triggered on detecting a 'pattern' of the same character being received/sent repeatedly. This functionality is demonstrated in the example peripherals/uart/uart_events. It can be used, e.g., to detect a command string with a specific number of identical characters (the 'pattern') at the end. The following functions are available:\n• None Configure and enable this interrupt using If the communication established with is no longer required, the driver can be removed to free allocated resources by calling . The API also defines several macros. For example, defines the length of hardware FIFO buffers; gives the maximum baud rate supported by the UART controllers, etc.\n\nThe following section uses to refer to UART register fields/bits. For more information on a specific option bit, see ESP32 Technical Reference Manual > UART Controller (UART) > Register Summary [PDF]. Use the register name to navigate to the register description and then find the field/bit.\n• None : if this bit is set, the transmitter's output signal loops back to the receiver's input signal.\n• None : if this bit is set, the transmitter will still be sending data if the receiver is busy (remove collisions automatically by hardware). The ESP32's RS485 UART hardware can detect signal collisions during transmission of a datagram and generate the interrupt if this interrupt is enabled. The term collision means that a transmitted datagram is not equal to the one received on the other end. Data collisions are usually associated with the presence of other active devices on the bus or might occur due to bus errors. The collision detection feature allows handling collisions when their interrupts are activated and triggered. The interrupts and can be used with the collision detection feature to control frame errors and parity bit errors accordingly in RS485 mode. This functionality is supported in the UART driver and can be used by selecting the mode (see the function ). The collision detection feature can work with circuit A and circuit C (see Section Interface Connection Options). In the case of using circuit A or B, the RTS pin connected to the DE pin of the bus driver should be controlled by the user application. Use the function to check if the collision detection flag has been raised. The ESP32 UART controllers themselves do not support half-duplex communication as they cannot provide automatic control of the RTS pin connected to the RE/DE input of RS485 bus driver. However, half-duplex communication can be achieved via software control of the RTS pin by the UART driver. This can be enabled by selecting the mode when calling . Once the host starts writing data to the TX FIFO buffer, the UART driver automatically asserts the RTS pin (logic 1); once the last bit of the data has been transmitted, the driver de-asserts the RTS pin (logic 0). To use this mode, the software would have to disable the hardware flow control function. This mode works with all the used circuits shown below. This section provides example schematics to demonstrate the basic aspects of ESP32's RS485 interface connection.\n• None The schematics below do not necessarily contain all required elements.\n• None The analog devices ADM483 & ADM2483 are examples of common RS485 transceivers and can be replaced with other similar transceivers. This circuit is preferable because it allows for collision detection and is quite simple at the same time. The receiver in the line driver is constantly enabled, which allows the UART to monitor the RS485 bus. Echo suppression is performed by the UART peripheral when the bit is enabled. This circuit does not allow for collision detection. It suppresses the null bytes that the hardware receives when the bit is set. The bit is not applicable in this case. This galvanically isolated circuit does not require RTS pin control by a software application or driver because it controls the transceiver direction automatically. However, it requires suppressing null bytes during transmission by setting to 1 and to 0. This setup can work in any RS485 UART mode or even in .\n• None This header file can be included with:\n• None This header file is a part of the API provided by the component. To declare that your component depends on , add the following to your CMakeLists.txt: Install UART driver and set the UART to the default configuration. UART ISR handler will be attached to the same CPU core that this function is running on. Rx_buffer_size should be greater than UART_HW_FIFO_LEN(uart_num). Tx_buffer_size should be either zero or greater than UART_HW_FIFO_LEN(uart_num).\n• None tx_buffer_size -- UART TX ring buffer size. If set to zero, driver will not use TX buffer, TX function will block task until all data have been sent out.\n• None uart_queue -- UART event queue handle (out param). On success, a new queue handle is written here to provide access to UART events. If set to NULL, driver will not use an event queue.\n• None intr_alloc_flags -- Flags used to allocate the interrupt. One or multiple (ORred) ESP_INTR_FLAG_* values. See esp_intr_alloc.h for more info. Do not set ESP_INTR_FLAG_IRAM here (the driver's ISR handler is not located in IRAM) Checks whether the driver is installed or not.\n• None data_bit -- Pointer to accept value of UART data bits.\n• None ESP_OK Success, result will be put in (*data_bit)\n• None stop_bits -- Pointer to accept value of UART stop bits.\n• None ESP_OK Success, result will be put in (*stop_bit)\n• None parity_mode -- Pointer to accept value of UART parity mode.\n• None ESP_OK Success, result will be put in (*parity_mode) Get the frequency of a clock source for the HP UART port.\n• None out_freq_hz -- [out] Output of frequency, in Hz\n• None ESP_ERR_INVALID_ARG: if the clock source is not supported\n• None baudrate -- Pointer to accept value of UART baud rate\n• None ESP_OK Success, result will be put in (*baudrate)\n• None inverse_mask -- Choose the wires that need to be inverted. Using the ORred mask of\n• None rx_thresh -- Threshold of Hardware RX flow control (0 ~ UART_HW_FIFO_LEN(uart_num)). Only when UART_HW_FLOWCTRL_RTS is set, will the rx_thresh value be set.\n• None enable -- switch on or off\n• None ESP_OK Success, result will be put in (*flow_ctrl)\n• None clr_mask -- Bit mask of the interrupt status to be cleared. If the GPIO number configured for a UART signal matches one of the IOMUX signals for that GPIO, the signal will be connected directly via the IOMUX. Otherwise the GPIO and signal will be connected via the GPIO Matrix. For example, if on an ESP32 the call is performed, as GPIO1 is UART0's default TX pin and GPIO3 is UART0's default RX pin, both will be connected to respectively U0TXD and U0RXD through the IOMUX, totally bypassing the GPIO matrix. The check is performed on a per-pin basis. Thus, it is possible to have RX pin binded to a GPIO through the GPIO matrix, whereas TX is binded to its GPIO through the IOMUX. It is possible to configure TX and RX to share the same IO (single wire mode), but please be aware of output conflict, which could damage the pad. Apply open-drain and pull-up to the pad ahead of time as a protection, or the upper layer protocol must guarantee no output from two ends at the same time. UART must be configured with hardware flow control disabled.\n• None idle_num -- idle interval after tx FIFO is empty(unit: the time it takes to send one bit under current baudrate) Send data to the UART port from a given buffer and length. This function will not wait for enough space in TX FIFO. It will just fill the available TX FIFO and return when the FIFO is full. This function should only be used when UART TX buffer is not enabled.\n• None OTHERS (>=0) The number of bytes pushed to the TX FIFO Send data to the UART port from a given buffer and length,. If the UART driver's parameter 'tx_buffer_size' is set to zero: This function will not return until all the data have been sent out, or at least pushed into TX FIFO. Otherwise, if the 'tx_buffer_size' > 0, this function will return after copying all the data to tx ring buffer, UART ISR will then move data from the ring buffer to TX FIFO gradually.\n• None OTHERS (>=0) The number of bytes pushed to the TX FIFO Send data to the UART port from a given buffer and length,. If the UART driver's parameter 'tx_buffer_size' is set to zero: This function will not return until all the data and the break signal have been sent out. After all data is sent out, send a break signal. Otherwise, if the 'tx_buffer_size' > 0, this function will return after copying all the data to tx ring buffer, UART ISR will then move data from the ring buffer to TX FIFO gradually. After all data sent out, send a break signal.\n• None brk_len -- break signal duration(unit: the time it takes to send one bit at current baudrate)\n• None OTHERS (>=0) The number of bytes pushed to the TX FIFO\n• None OTHERS (>=0) The number of bytes read from UART buffer Alias of uart_flush_input. UART ring buffer flush. This will discard all data in the UART RX buffer. Instead of waiting the data sent out, this function will clear UART rx buffer. In order to send all the data in tx FIFO, we can use uart_wait_tx_done function. Clear input buffer, discard all the data is in the ring-buffer. In order to send all the data in tx FIFO, we can use uart_wait_tx_done function.\n• None size -- Pointer of size_t to accept the free space size UART disable pattern detect function. Designed for applications like 'AT commands'. When the hardware detects a series of one same character, the interrupt will be triggered. UART enable pattern detect function. Designed for applications like 'AT commands'. When the hardware detect a series of one same character, the interrupt will be triggered.\n• None chr_num -- number of the character, 8bit value.\n• None chr_tout -- timeout of the interval between each pattern characters, 16bit value, unit is the baud-rate cycle you configured. When the duration is more than this value, it will not take this data as at_cmd char.\n• None post_idle -- idle time after the last pattern character, 16bit value, unit is the baud-rate cycle you configured. When the duration is less than this value, it will not take the previous data as the last at_cmd char\n• None pre_idle -- idle time before the first pattern character, 16bit value, unit is the baud-rate cycle you configured. When the duration is less than this value, it will not take this data as the first at_cmd char. Return the nearest detected pattern position in buffer. The positions of the detected pattern are saved in a queue, this function will dequeue the first pattern position and move the pointer to next pattern position. The following APIs will modify the pattern position info: uart_flush_input, uart_read_bytes, uart_driver_delete, uart_pop_pattern_pos It is the application's responsibility to ensure atomic access to the pattern queue and the rx data buffer when using pattern detect feature. If the RX buffer is full and flow control is not enabled, the detected pattern may not be found in the rx buffer due to overflow.\n• None (-1) No pattern found for current index or parameter error\n• None others the pattern position in rx buffer. Return the nearest detected pattern position in buffer. The positions of the detected pattern are saved in a queue, This function do nothing to the queue. The following APIs will modify the pattern position info: uart_flush_input, uart_read_bytes, uart_driver_delete, uart_pop_pattern_pos It is the application's responsibility to ensure atomic access to the pattern queue and the rx data buffer when using pattern detect feature. If the RX buffer is full and flow control is not enabled, the detected pattern may not be found in the rx buffer due to overflow.\n• None (-1) No pattern found for current index or parameter error\n• None others the pattern position in rx buffer. Allocate a new memory with the given length to save record the detected pattern position in rx buffer.\n• None queue_length -- Max queue length for the detected pattern. If the queue length is not large enough, some pattern positions might be lost. Set this value to the maximum number of patterns that could be saved in data buffer at the same time. This function must be executed after uart_driver_install(), when the driver object is initialized.\n• None uart_num -- Uart number to configure, the max port number is (UART_NUM_MAX -1). If application is using higher baudrate and it is observed that bytes in hardware RX fifo are overwritten then this threshold can be reduced\n• None threshold -- Threshold value above which RX fifo full interrupt is generated\n• None threshold -- Threshold value below which TX fifo empty interrupt is generated\n• None uart_num -- Uart number to configure, the max port number is (UART_NUM_MAX -1).\n• None tout_thresh -- This parameter defines timeout threshold in uart symbol periods. The maximum value of threshold is 126. tout_thresh = 1, defines TOUT interrupt timeout equal to transmission time of one symbol (~11 bit) on current baudrate. If the time is expired the UART_RXFIFO_TOUT_INT interrupt is triggered. If tout_thresh == 0, the TOUT feature is disabled. Returns collision detection flag for RS485 mode Function returns the collision detection flag into variable pointed by collision_flag. *collision_flag = true, if collision detected else it is equal to false. This function should be executed when actual transmission is completed (after uart_write_bytes()).\n• None uart_num -- Uart number to configure the max port number is (UART_NUM_MAX -1).\n• None collision_flag -- Pointer to variable of type bool to return collision flag. Set the number of RX pin signal edges for light sleep wakeup. UART can be used to wake up the system from light sleep. This feature works by counting the number of positive edges on RX pin and comparing the count to the threshold. When the count exceeds the threshold, system is woken up from light sleep. This function allows setting the threshold value. Stop bit and parity bits (if enabled) also contribute to the number of edges. For example, letter 'a' with ASCII code 97 is encoded as 0100001101 on the wire (with 8n1 configuration), start and stop bits included. This sequence has 3 positive edges (transitions from 0 to 1). Therefore, to wake up the system when 'a' is sent, set wakeup_threshold=3. The character that triggers wakeup is not received by UART (i.e. it can not be obtained from UART FIFO). Depending on the baud rate, a few characters after that will also not be received. Note that when the chip enters and exits light sleep mode, APB frequency will be changing. To ensure that UART has correct Baud rate all the time, it is necessary to select a source clock which has a fixed frequency and remains active during sleep. For the supported clock sources of the chips, please refer to or in ESP32, the wakeup signal can only be input via IO_MUX (i.e. GPIO3 should be configured as function_1 to wake up UART0, GPIO9 should be configured as function_5 to wake up UART1), UART2 does not support light sleep wakeup feature.\n• None wakeup_threshold -- number of RX edges for light sleep wakeup, value is 3 .. 0x3ff.\n• None ESP_ERR_INVALID_ARG if uart_num is incorrect or wakeup_threshold is outside of [3, 0x3ff] range. Get the number of RX pin signal edges for light sleep wakeup. See description of uart_set_wakeup_threshold for the explanation of UART wakeup feature.\n• None out_wakeup_threshold -- [out] output, set to the current value of wakeup threshold for the given UART. Wait until UART tx memory empty and the last char send ok (polling mode). Configure TX signal loop back to RX module, just for the test usage.\n• None loop_back_en -- Set ture to enable the loop back function, else set it false. When always_rx_timeout is true, timeout interrupt is triggered even if FIFO is full. This function can cause extra timeout interrupts triggered only to send the timeout event. Call this function only if you want to ensure timeout interrupt will always happen after a byte stream.\n• None always_rx_timeout_en -- Set to false enable the default behavior of timeout interrupt, set it to true to always trigger timeout interrupt. If set, the driver will backup/restore the HP UART registers before entering/after exiting sleep mode. By this approach, the system can power off HP UART's power domain. This can save power, but at the expense of more RAM being consumed UART interrupt enable mask, choose from UART_XXXX_INT_ENA_M under UART_INT_ENA_REG(i), connect with bit-or operator UART data read timeout flag for UART_DATA event (no new data received during configured RX TOUT) If the event is caused by FIFO-full interrupt, then there will be no event with the timeout flag before the next byte coming. UART event types used in the ring buffer.\n• None This header file can be included with: UART AT cmd char configuration parameters Note that this function may different on different chip. Please refer to the TRM at confirguration. the idle time(in baud-rate) between the non AT char and first AT char the idle time(in baud-rate) between the last AT char and the none AT char If the software flow control is enabled and the data amount in rxfifo is less than xon_thrd, an xon_char will be sent If the software flow control is enabled and the data amount in rxfifo is more than xoff_thrd, an xoff_char will be sent The UART peripherals have dedicated IO_MUX pins to which they are connected directly. However, signals can also be routed to other pins using the less direct GPIO matrix. To use direct routes, you need to know which pin is a dedicated IO_MUX pin for a UART channel. GPIO Lookup Macros simplify the process of finding and assigning IO_MUX pins. You choose a macro based on either the IO_MUX pin number, or a required UART channel name, and the macro returns the matching counterpart for you. See some examples below. These macros are useful if you need very high UART baud rates (over 40 MHz), which means you will have to use IO_MUX pins only. In other cases, these macros can be ignored, and you can use the GPIO Matrix as it allows you to configure any GPIO pin for any UART function.\n• None returns the UART number of GPIO 19 when connected to the UART peripheral via IO_MUX (this is UART_NUM_0)\n• None returns the UART number of GPIO 19 when used as the UART CTS pin via IO_MUX (this is UART_NUM_0). It is similar to the above macro but specifies the pin function which is also part of the IO_MUX assignment.\n• None This header file can be included with:"

        "document": "We are in the age of connected devices, devices could talk each other either via RF or wired. In one of my postI explained about Radio Frequency communication using Xbee. In this post lets see how devices can talk each other via wired network. One of the advantage of Wired network is, it is cost effective compare to buying an XBee modules like Xbee pro. I personally prefer Wireless communication as it’s hassle free, just place the devices where ever we need.\n\nIn one of my previous post I explained how to Bootload Atmega16A and program it using Arduino. Next step is to establish the communication between the Micro controllers and Raspberry pi. In this case my Raspberry Pi is acting as the central hub that talk to other controllers and collect data or issue command to do some job.\n\nI better leave it to Wikipedia to give a detailed explanation of the protocol. In brief using RS485, devices can communicate Full duplex or Half duplex. I used a Half duplex communication. So it’s a protocol, how do we implement the protocol in our hardware, there is a chip Max485 from Maxim. This chip can establish a half duplex communication.\n\nMax 485 is a 8 pin chip as shown below. It’s a DIP chip and SMD have different pin layout.\n\nPin 1 – RO: It’s the Data-In pin, devices can read data from the bus using this pin. Rx pin of the Micro controllers should connect to this pin.\n\nRE and DE: Set this pin to Logical High to transmit any data to the bus. Set this pin to Low to receive data from the bus.\n\nPin 4 DI: Devices can transmit data via this pin. This pin should be connected to the Tx pin of the device.\n\nPin 8 and 5 – VCC and GND: To power the chip, VCC should be 5 volt.\n\nPin 7 and 6 – A and B: Here we connect the data line. A should connect to the A Pin of the next Max 485 and B with B.\n\nThe below picture will illustrate how to connect all the devices together.\n\nAs per the diagram, if RPi want to transmit any data. We should set a high voltage on GPIO 18 and issue a serial write. All other devices in the network will be in listening mode and can read data using serial read. If any other device wanted to transmit data, then issue a Logical High to RE DE pin and will get promoted as a master and transmit data via serial write.\n\nNow it’s up to you to program it and do some cool things with it."

        "document": "An In-depth Exploration of the RS-485 Serial Interface\n\nRS-485 stands as a cornerstone of industrial communication, reflecting a robust protocol designed to manage data transmission under challenging conditions. It is renowned for its flexibility, accommodating up to 32 devices on a single communication line without significant loss in signal integrity, a feature that has been widely adopted in scenarios demanding high-speed data transfer and multi-device connectivity. By leveraging differential signaling, RS-485 addresses the inherent issues of electrical noise in industrial environments, ensuring data integrity and transmission reliability over distances up to 4000 feet (approximately 1200 meters). This overview sets the stage for a detailed exploration of the RS-485 standard, its integration into the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, and its practical implementations in various communication-intensive settings.\n\nRS-485 is a widely used industrial communication standard designed to facilitate reliable data exchange across multiple devices over long distances. It’s particularly effective in environments with high levels of electrical interference.\n\nThis protocol is ideal for both point-to-point and multi-point communications, making it suitable for numerous devices needing to be connected on a single communication line. RS-485 can manage long cable runs while maintaining strong signal integrity, even when many devices are involved.\n\nBuilt for tough industrial conditions, RS-485 is engineered to ensure that data is transmitted accurately and consistently, even in environments where other communication methods might struggle. By using differential signaling, it reduces the impact of electrical noise and minimizes the risk of signal degradation. This approach significantly enhances the system's resistance to interference, ensuring that data remains clear and intact over long distances.\n\nRS-485 is best utilized in scenarios requiring long cable runs and where several devices need to communicate over a single bus system. This is often the case in large-scale industrial environments, building automation systems, and situations where the wiring must cover extensive distances.\n\nRS-485 is highly resistant to electrical noise, making it an excellent choice for environments with significant electromagnetic interference, such as automotive manufacturing plants and other heavy industrial settings. RS-485 can transmit data reliably over distances up to 4000 feet (approximately 1200 meters), which far exceeds the range of many other communication standards. The protocol allows for the connection of up to 32 devices on a single communication line without a noticeable loss in signal quality, which is used for complex automated systems. By using differential signaling, where two wires carry opposite signals, RS-485 effectively cancels out electrical noise, ensuring data integrity in noisy environments.\n\nRS-485, also referred to as TIA-485 or EIA-485, is a key standard that ensures reliable serial communication between network devices. It defines the suitable electrical characteristics required for different devices to work together effectively.\n\nThis standard is integrated into the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, which provides a clear structure for network design, ranging from physical connections to the applications that use them. By adhering to the RS-485 specifications, devices from various manufacturers can communicate with each other smoothly, creating a networking environment that is both flexible and adaptable.\n\nPhysical Layer of the OSI Model: Key Concepts and Functions\n\nIn the OSI model, the physical layer is the foundation of data transmission, converting digital data into electrical signals that can travel across networks. RS-485 enhances this layer by using balanced, differential signal lines, known as 'A' and 'B'. These lines work together to significantly reduce noise and maintain the integrity of data over long distances.\n\nThe design of RS-485 includes matched impedance at both the transmitting and receiving ends, allowing for flexible network topologies. The differential signaling approach effectively cancels out common mode noise and accommodates a broad voltage range, ensuring reliable communication even in challenging electrical environments. These features are settling for maintaining strong and consistent data transmission across various conditions.\n\nThe Data Link Layer of the OSI Model\n\nIn RS-485 systems, the data link layer typically uses a Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART) to handle serial communication. This layer plays a key role in organizing, addressing, and transmitting data across the network. It ensures that data is delivered accurately by using precise physical addressing and error detection methods.\n\nRS-485 is designed for half-duplex communication, where devices take turns sending and receiving data. This setup is ideal for situations where simultaneous data exchange isn't required, making data transfers more efficient. By alternating between sending and receiving, the system effectively manages data flow without needing constant two-way communication.\n\nDiscovering the Network Layer's Role in the OSI Model\n\nIn an RS-485 system, the network layer is used for managing communication between devices, especially in determining the paths that data will take. This is particularly significant in multi-drop systems, where multiple devices share the same communication line. Effective management of these data paths is desirable to prevent collisions and ensure smooth, uninterrupted communication.\n\nAlthough the RS-485 standard doesn't prescribe specific network protocols, it provides the flexibility to implement various addressing and control strategies. This adaptability allows the network to be tailored to specific operational needs, ensuring robust and efficient communication management across the system.\n\nConsidering the Application Layer of the OSI Model\n\nAt the application layer, RS-485 supports suitable high-level communication functions, making it compatible with various industrial systems. This layer interacts directly with user applications, handling tasks like data interpretation, command execution, and device addressing.\n\nRS-485 is versatile enough to work with both proprietary and standard communication protocols, such as Modbus. This allows for flexible addressing and command structures that can be customized to meet the specific needs of different applications and devices. This adaptability ensures that communication remains effective and efficient across a wide range of industrial environments.\n\nRS-485 is a standard that defines the electrical characteristics of drivers and receivers in serial communication systems. It is well-known for its durability and ability to maintain signal quality over long distances, making it ideal for industrial environments.\n\nThe two-wire configuration is the most commonly used setup in RS-485 systems. This setup uses a twisted pair of wires to ensure reliable communication. Two wires are used—one for transmitting data and the other for receiving data. The wires are twisted together to reduce susceptibility to external electromagnetic interference (EMI). This twisting helps cancel out noise from external sources, maintaining signal integrity. In this mode, data can be sent and received, but not at the same time. Devices on the RS-485 network share the same pair of wires, taking turns to transmit or receive data. This setup simplifies the system and reduces costs.\n\nFor applications that require simultaneous two-way communication, the four-wire configuration is used. This setup includes two pairs of wires—one pair for sending data and another pair for receiving it. Unlike half-duplex, full-duplex allows data to be sent and received simultaneously, which is substantial for real-time communication where delays are unacceptable. While full-duplex offers higher communication efficiency, it is more complex and costly. It requires more cabling and often more sophisticated hardware to manage the simultaneous data flows.\n\nAdvantages of Using RS-485 in Modern Communication Systems\n\nRS-485 is widely used in industrial and automation settings due to its reliable performance and flexibility.\n\nRS-232 and RS-485 are both persistent serial communication standards, but they serve different purposes based on their unique characteristics.\n\nIn conclusion, RS-485 emerges as the ultimate protocol in the realm of industrial communication, driven by its robustness, reliability, and adaptability. Through its effective use of differential signaling and support for long cable runs, RS-485 mitigates the challenges posed by electrical interference, proving requisite in complex automated systems like SCADA and building management systems. The flexibility in network topology and device connectivity further enhances its practicality, enabling efficient data management across diverse operational landscapes.\n\nIt digs into the technical nuances and practical applications of RS-485, and it becomes clear that its continued evolution and integration into modern industrial systems underscore its serious role in ensuring seamless and efficient communication. Whether through enhancements in wiring such as the incorporation of coaxial cables or optical fibers, or its comparison with other standards like RS-232, RS-485 remains a key element in the toolkit of industrial communication, providing a scalable, cost-effective solution tailored for high-demand environments.\n\n1. What is the principle of RS485?\n\nRS485 is a standard defining the electrical characteristics of drivers and receivers used in serial communication systems. The ultimate principle is balanced data transmission, which means data is transmitted through a pair of wires where each signal is complemented by its inverse. This design helps in reducing the noise and improving the reliability of data transmission over long distances, supporting multiple devices in a networked system.\n\n2. What is an RS485 port used for?\n\nAn RS485 port is commonly used in industrial and commercial settings to enable robust serial communication between multiple devices over long distances. It’s ideal for networking equipment in environments with high electromagnetic interference, such as factory floors or large-scale control systems. Devices like PLCs, sensors, and controllers often connect via RS485 to ensure stable data exchanges.\n\n3. What is the RS485 interface standard?\n\nThe RS485 interface standard specifies electrical characteristics for multi-point communications. It defines the voltage levels and the requirements for the transmitters and receivers. Notably, it allows up to 32 devices to communicate through the same data line over distances up to 4000 feet at speeds up to 10 Mbps, depending on the cable length and the baud rate used.\n\n4. What is the difference between UART and RS485?\n\nUART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) is a hardware communication protocol used for asynchronous serial communication in which the data format and transmission speeds are configurable. RS485, on the other hand, is a physical layer standard used to extend UART communication for long distances and in electrically noisy environments. UART can be thought of as the communication protocol, while RS485 is a standard that enhances UART’s capabilities in specific settings.\n\nRS485 serial interfacing involves connecting multiple devices using differential signals to enable robust two-way (full-duplex) or half-duplex communication. It uses a pair of wires to carry each signal and its complementary inverse, which helps in minimizing the effects of electrical noise and resistance, making it suitable for long-distance communications and in harsh industrial environments. This interface is widely used in applications requiring reliable data transmission between multiple devices without direct computer intervention."

        "document": "I'd like to ask for some help on choosing a communication protocol for my senior university project. Let me start by explaining a few things.\n\nHere are the MCUs at my disposal:\n\nI have one master device that is connected to a computer using an ethernet cable (currently using an Arduino Mega with an Ethernet Shield W5100). That part is already solved and working. Now, I want to have multiple slave devices that can send/receive data to/from the master device. Here's the catch. I wish those devices to act as a plug'n'play device, because I want the whole system to be scalable. This requirement rules out SPI and Serial communication (AFAIK). In addition to that, I want to use wired connection between the devices, because of latency issues with wireless communication. Therefore, I need some help choosing a suitable communication protocol.\n\nLet me explain the plug'n'play functionality a little bit more.Each slave device has it's own logic (like reading some sensors, displaying data on a TFT or 7 segment display). Some slave devices will only send data to the master, some will only receive data from the master, and others will do both.\n\nThe data consists of multiple variable length strings, floating point numbers and integer numbers (even if I am reading a simple sensor, I need to send additional information specific for each slave device).\n\nFor now, I only plan to have 3-4 slave devices, but in the future I might want to add more and incorporate them into the whole system without the need to reprogram the master device. When I plug in a new device and restart the system, the first thing the master mcu does is it scans for all devices present in the system. After doing so, it will start communicating with each device (one by one) and send or receive data based on some variable defined in each slave device (for example 0 will represent that the device will only receive data, 1 will represent that the device will send data, and 2 will represent both sending and receiving data).\n\nThat being said, here are my thoughts:\n• I2C - I can connect 128 devices which is way more than enough for me. Each device will have it's own address and the master mcu will scan them and send or request data from each slave device. The problem here is that the data I will be sending is large, and I've seen that I2C is mostly used to send quite small amounts of data. For Arduinos, the Wire library has a 32 byte limit, which yes, can be increased, but I'm still not sure if it's the right thing to do.\n• One Wire - Basically the same thing as I2C, just slower I guess.\n• CAN - I've never used it before, but it has the same limitation as I2C. As I can see on the internet, it is way more robust than I2C, which is a plus. Unfortunally, it also requires an additional hardware module, which I'd prefer to avoid if possible.\n\nPersonally, I think that I2C with fragmented data might be my best bet, but I'm not sure.\n\nI can completely avoid this whole thing by connecting everything to a single mcu, but I really want to learn more and try to create a modularized system.\n\nI'll be more than happy to provide any additional information if needed.\n\nI would love to hear your opinion and thoughts on this and I'd really appreciate any help.\n\nAfter much consideration, I've finally decided on using RS-485 with a custom protocol for my project. If I get the opportunity, I'll try to reimplement the whole system using CAN, but for now I'll stick with RS-485.\n\nHuge thanks to everyone for helping me choose the right path for my project. I learned quite a lot of things and I think that's what counts the most at the end."
