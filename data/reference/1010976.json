        "document": "Applications fail, servers fail. Sooner or later you will see an exception in production. Even if your code is 100% correct, you will still see exceptions from time to time. Why? Because everything else involved will fail. Here are some situations where perfectly fine code can lead to server errors:\n• None the client terminated the request early and the application was still reading from the incoming data\n• None the database server was overloaded and could not handle the query\n• None a programming error in a library you are using\n• None network connection of the server to another system failed\n\nAnd that’s just a small sample of issues you could be facing. So how do we deal with that sort of problem? By default if your application runs in production mode, and an exception is raised Flask will display a very simple page for you and log the exception to the .\n\nBut there is more you can do, and we will cover some better setups to deal with errors including custom exceptions and 3rd party tools.\n\nWhen an error occurs in Flask, an appropriate HTTP status code will be returned. 400-499 indicate errors with the client’s request data, or about the data requested. 500-599 indicate errors with the server or application itself. You might want to show custom error pages to the user when an error occurs. This can be done by registering error handlers. An error handler is a function that returns a response when a type of error is raised, similar to how a view is a function that returns a response when a request URL is matched. It is passed the instance of the error being handled, which is most likely a . The status code of the response will not be set to the handler’s code. Make sure to provide the appropriate HTTP status code when returning a response from a handler. Register handlers by decorating a function with . Or use to register the function later. Remember to set the error code when returning the response. # or, without the decorator subclasses like and their HTTP codes are interchangeable when registering handlers. ( ) Non-standard HTTP codes cannot be registered by code because they are not known by Werkzeug. Instead, define a subclass of with the appropriate code and register and raise that exception class. Handlers can be registered for any exception class, not just subclasses or HTTP status codes. Handlers can be registered for a specific class, or for all subclasses of a parent class. When building a Flask application you will run into exceptions. If some part of your code breaks while handling a request (and you have no error handlers registered), a “500 Internal Server Error” ( ) will be returned by default. Similarly, “404 Not Found” ( ) error will occur if a request is sent to an unregistered route. If a route receives an unallowed request method, a “405 Method Not Allowed” ( ) will be raised. These are all subclasses of and are provided by default in Flask. Flask gives you the ability to raise any HTTP exception registered by Werkzeug. However, the default HTTP exceptions return simple exception pages. You might want to show custom error pages to the user when an error occurs. This can be done by registering error handlers. When Flask catches an exception while handling a request, it is first looked up by code. If no handler is registered for the code, Flask looks up the error by its class hierarchy; the most specific handler is chosen. If no handler is registered, subclasses show a generic message about their code, while other exceptions are converted to a generic “500 Internal Server Error”. For example, if an instance of is raised, and a handler is registered for and , the more specific handler is called with the exception instance to generate the response. Handlers registered on the blueprint take precedence over those registered globally on the application, assuming a blueprint is handling the request that raises the exception. However, the blueprint cannot handle 404 routing errors because the 404 occurs at the routing level before the blueprint can be determined. It is possible to register error handlers for very generic base classes such as or even . However, be aware that these will catch more than you might expect. For example, an error handler for might be useful for turning the default HTML errors pages into JSON. However, this handler will trigger for things you don’t cause directly, such as 404 and 405 errors during routing. Be sure to craft your handler carefully so you don’t lose information about the HTTP error. \"\"\"Return JSON instead of HTML for HTTP errors.\"\"\" # start with the correct headers and status code from the error An error handler for might seem useful for changing how all errors, even unhandled ones, are presented to the user. However, this is similar to doing in Python, it will capture all otherwise unhandled errors, including all HTTP status codes. In most cases it will be safer to register handlers for more specific exceptions. Since instances are valid WSGI responses, you could also pass them through directly. Error handlers still respect the exception class hierarchy. If you register handlers for both and , the handler will not handle subclasses because the handler is more specific. When there is no error handler registered for an exception, a 500 Internal Server Error will be returned instead. See for information about this behavior. If there is an error handler registered for , this will be invoked. As of Flask 1.1.0, this error handler will always be passed an instance of , not the original unhandled error. The original error is available as . An error handler for “500 Internal Server Error” will be passed uncaught exceptions in addition to explicit 500 errors. In debug mode, a handler for “500 Internal Server Error” will not be used. Instead, the interactive debugger will be shown.\n\nSometimes when building a Flask application, you might want to raise a to signal to the user that something is wrong with the request. Fortunately, Flask comes with a handy function that aborts a request with a HTTP error from werkzeug as desired. It will also provide a plain black and white error page for you with a basic description, but nothing fancy. Depending on the error code it is less or more likely for the user to actually see such an error. Consider the code below, we might have a user profile route, and if the user fails to pass a username we can raise a “400 Bad Request”. If the user passes a username and we can’t find it, we raise a “404 Not Found”. # a username needs to be supplied in the query args # a successful request would be like /profile?username=jack # if a username isn't supplied in the request, return a 400 bad request # if a user can't be found by their username, return 404 not found Here is another example implementation for a “404 Page Not Found” exception: # note that we set the 404 status explicitly An example template might be this: Page Not Found Page Not Found What you were looking for is just not there. go somewhere nice The above examples wouldn’t actually be an improvement on the default exception pages. We can create a custom 500.html template like this: Internal Server Error Internal Server Error Oops... we seem to have made a mistake, sorry! Go somewhere nice instead It can be implemented by rendering the template on “500 Internal Server Error”: # note that we set the 500 status explicitly When using Modular Applications with Blueprints:\n\nIn Modular Applications with Blueprints, most error handlers will work as expected. However, there is a caveat concerning handlers for 404 and 405 exceptions. These error handlers are only invoked from an appropriate statement or a call to in another of the blueprint’s view functions; they are not invoked by, e.g., an invalid URL access. This is because the blueprint does not “own” a certain URL space, so the application instance has no way of knowing which blueprint error handler it should run if given an invalid URL. If you would like to execute different handling strategies for these errors based on URL prefixes, they may be defined at the application level using the proxy object. # if a request is in our blog URL space # otherwise we return our generic site-wide 404 page # if a request has the wrong method to our API # we return a json saying so\n\nWhen building APIs in Flask, some developers realise that the built-in exceptions are not expressive enough for APIs and that the content type of text/html they are emitting is not very useful for API consumers. Using the same techniques as above and we can return JSON responses to API errors. is called with a parameter. The error handler will use that as the JSON error message, and set the status code to 404. We can also create custom exception classes. For instance, we can introduce a new custom exception for an API that can take a proper human readable message, a status code for the error and some optional payload to give more context for the error. This is a simple example: # an API app route for getting user information A view can now raise that exception with an error message. Additionally some extra payload can be provided as a dictionary through the parameter."

The library includes type definitions for all request params and response fields, and offers both synchronous and asynchronous clients powered by httpx.\n\nIt is generated from our OpenAPI specification with Stainless.\n\nThe REST API documentation can be found on platform.openai.com. The full API of this library can be found in api.md.\n\nThe full API of this library can be found in api.md.\n\nThe primary API for interacting with OpenAI models is the Responses API. You can generate text from the model with the code below.\n\nThe previous standard (supported indefinitely) for generating text is the Chat Completions API. You can use that API to generate text from the model with the code below.\n\nWhile you can provide an keyword argument, we recommend using python-dotenv to add to your file so that your API key is not stored in source control. Get an API key here.\n\nWith the image as a base64 encoded string:\n\nSimply import instead of and use with each API call:\n\nFunctionality between the synchronous and asynchronous clients is otherwise identical.\n\nWe provide support for streaming responses using Server Side Events (SSE).\n\nThe async client uses the exact same interface.\n\nThe Realtime API enables you to build low-latency, multi-modal conversational experiences. It currently supports text and audio as both input and output, as well as function calling through a WebSocket connection.\n\nUnder the hood the SDK uses the library to manage connections.\n\nThe Realtime API works through a combination of client-sent events and server-sent events. Clients can send events to do things like update session configuration or send text and audio inputs. Server events confirm when audio responses have completed, or when a text response from the model has been received. A full event reference can be found here and a guide can be found here.\n\nHowever the real magic of the Realtime API is handling audio inputs / outputs, see this example TUI script for a fully fledged example.\n\nWhenever an error occurs, the Realtime API will send an event and the connection will stay open and remain usable. This means you need to handle it yourself, as no errors are raised directly by the SDK when an event comes in.\n\nNested request parameters are TypedDicts. Responses are Pydantic models which also provide helper methods for things like:\n\nTyped requests and responses provide autocomplete and documentation within your editor. If you would like to see type errors in VS Code to help catch bugs earlier, set to .\n\nList methods in the OpenAI API are paginated.\n\nThis library provides auto-paginating iterators with each list response, so you do not have to request successive pages manually:\n\nAlternatively, you can use the , , or methods for more granular control working with pages:\n\nOr just work directly with the returned data:\n\nNested parameters are dictionaries, typed using , for example:\n\nRequest parameters that correspond to file uploads can be passed as , a instance or a tuple of .\n\nThe async client uses the exact same interface.

Unless documented otherwise, all other prefix properties, methods and modules are private.\n\nCertain errors are automatically retried 2 times by default, with a short exponential backoff. Connection errors (for example, due to a network connectivity problem), 408 Request Timeout, 409 Conflict, 429 Rate Limit, and >=500 Internal errors are all retried by default.\n\nYou can use the option to configure or disable retry settings:\n\nBy default requests time out after 10 minutes. You can configure this with a option, which accepts a float or an object:\n\nOn timeout, an is thrown.\n\nNote that requests that time out are retried twice by default.\n\nWe use the standard library module.\n\nYou can enable logging by setting the environment variable to .\n\nOr to for more verbose logging.\n\nIn an API response, a field may be explicitly , or missing entirely; in either case, its value is in this library.

In the async client, all methods will be async.\n\nA migration script will be provided & the migration in general should be smooth.\n\nThe above interface eagerly reads the full response body when you make the request, which may not always be what you want.\n\nTo stream the response body, use instead, which requires a context manager and only reads the response body once you call , , , , , or . In the async client, these are async methods.\n\nAs such, methods return a different object, and the async client returns an object.\n\nThe context manager is required so that the response will reliably be closed.\n\nThis library is typed for convenient access to the documented API.\n\nIf you need to access undocumented endpoints, params, or response properties, the library can still be used.\n\nTo make requests to undocumented endpoints, you can make requests using , , and other http verbs. Options on the client will be respected (such as retries) when making this request.\n\nIf you want to explicitly send an extra param, you can do so with the , , and request options.\n\nTo access undocumented response properties, you can access the extra fields like .

OpenAI is a leading research organization that focuses on advancing AI in a safe and beneficial way. OpenAI provides an API (Application Programming Interface) that allows developers to easily access their powerful AI models and integrate them into their own applications.\n\nIn this guide, we will explore the OpenAI Python API and how it can be used to build powerful AI applications. We will cover the following topics:\n• Setting up your OpenAI account and API key.\n• Understanding the different OpenAI models available.\n• Using the OpenAI Python API to generate text, answer questions, and more.\n• Best practices for using the OpenAI Python API in your applications.\n\nSetting up your OpenAI account and API key:\n\nBefore we can start using the OpenAI Python API, we need to set up an account and obtain an API key. To do this, follow these steps:\n• Fill out the form with your information and click “Create Account”.\n• Once you are logged in, click on “API Keys” in the left-hand menu.\n• Click on “Generate New Key” to create a new API key.\n• Copy your API key – we will use it later in our Python code.\n\nUnderstanding the different OpenAI models available:\n\nOpenAI provides several AI models that can be used for different tasks such as language generation, question answering, image recognition, and more.\n\nSome of the popular models are:\n• DALL-E: A model that can generate images from textual descriptions.\n• CLIP: A model that can recognize objects in images and classify them based on their attributes.\n\nUsing the OpenAI Python API to generate text, answer questions, and more:\n\nNow that we have our API key and an understanding of the different OpenAI models available, let’s dive into some code examples.\n\nFirst, we need to install the OpenAI Python module using pip:\n\nOnce we have installed the module, we can use it to generate text using the GPT-3 model. Here is some example code:\n\n\n\n openai.api_key = \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\n\n \n\n prompt = \"Hello, my name is John and I am a software engineer.\"\n\n model = \"text-davinci-003\"\n\n response = openai.Completion.create(engine=model, prompt=prompt, max_tokens=50)\n\n \n\n generated_text = response.choices[0].text\n\n print(generated_text)\n\nIn this example, we are using the GPT-3 model (“text-davinci-003”) to generate text based on a prompt. The generated text is limited to 50 tokens (words), which can be adjusted as per the requirement.\n\nOpenAI is an artificial intelligence research organization founded in 2015 by a group of entrepreneurs, including Elon Musk and Sam Altman. The organization aims to develop and promote friendly AI for the betterment of humanity as a whole.\n\nOne of the ways OpenAI achieves this goal is by providing access to its cutting-edge AI models through its Python API. This API allows developers to easily integrate OpenAI’s AI models into their own applications, enabling them to perform tasks such as language recognition, language generation, and more.\n\nTo get started with the OpenAI Python API, you will need to create an account on the OpenAI website and obtain an API key. Once you have your API key, you can use it to authenticate your requests to the OpenAI API.\n\nIn addition to providing access to its models, OpenAI also offers extensive documentation and support for developers using its Python API. This includes detailed tutorials, code examples, and a community forum where developers can ask questions and share their experiences.\n\nUsing the OpenAI Python API can be a powerful tool for developers looking to incorporate AI functionality into their applications. With its comprehensive documentation and user-friendly interface, it is an excellent choice for anyone looking to explore the potential of AI technology.\n\nUsing the OpenAI API with Python\n\nOpenAI is a research organization that aims to create artificial intelligence in a safe and beneficial way. They offer an API that allows developers to access their cutting-edge models and use them in their own applications. In this section, we will explore how to use the OpenAI API with Python.\n\nRemember, to get started, you will need an OpenAI API key. You can sign up for one on their website. Once you have your key, you can install the `openai` Python package using pip:\n\nOne of the most popular use cases for the OpenAI API is text generation. You can provide a prompt to the API, and it will generate text that continues from that prompt. Here’s an example:\n\nIn this example, we’re asking the `davinci` engine to generate text based on the prompt “The quick brown fox”. We’re asking for a maximum of 50 tokens (words or punctuation marks). The API will return a list of possible completions, but we’re only interested in the first one.\n\nThe OpenAI API also supports language translation. You can provide a piece of text in one language and ask the API to translate it into another language. Here’s an example:\n\nimport openai\n\n openai.api_key = \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\n\n \n\n text = \"Hello, how are you?\"\n\n response = openai.Completion.create(\n\n engine=\"davinci\",\n\n prompt=f\"Translate from English to Spanish: {text}\",\n\n max_tokens=50\n\n )\n\n \n\n translation = response.choices[0].text.strip()\n\n print(translation)\n\nIn this example, we’re asking the `davinci` engine to translate the English text “Hello, how are you?” into Spanish. We’re using f-strings to format the prompt string.\n\nYou can also use the OpenAI API for sentiment analysis. Given a piece of text, the API will tell you whether it has a positive or negative sentiment. Here’s an example:\n\nIn this example, we’re asking the `davinci` engine to perform sentiment analysis on the text “I love ice cream!”. The API will return either “Positive” or “Negative”.\n\nThe OpenAI API also supports question-answering. You can provide a context and a question, and the API will return an answer based on that context. Here’s an example:\n\nimport openai\n\n openai.api_key = \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\n\n \n\n context = \"Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity.\"\n\n question = \"Where was Albert Einstein born?\"\n\n response = openai.Completion.create(\n\n engine=\"davinci-003\",\n\n prompt=f\"Question answering:\n\nContext: {context}\n\nQuestion: {question}\",\n\n max_tokens=50\n\n )\n\n \n\n answer = response.choices[0].text.strip()\n\n print(answer)\n\nIn this example, we’re asking the `davinci` engine to answer the question “Where was Albert Einstein born?” based on the context “Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity.” The API will return the answer “Germany”.\n\nYou can also use the OpenAI API for summarization. Given a long piece of text, the API will generate a summary that captures the most important information. Here’s an example:\n\nimport openai\n\n openai.api_key = \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\n\n \n\n text = \"Whisper is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervised data collected from the web. We show that the use of such a large and diverse dataset leads to improved robustness to accents, background noise and technical language. Moreover, it enables transcription in multiple languages, as well as translation from those languages into English. We are open-sourcing models and inference code to serve as a foundation for building useful applications and for further research on robust speech processing.\"\n\n response = openai.Completion.create(\n\n engine=\"davinci\",\n\n prompt=f\"Summarize:\n\n{text}\",\n\n max_tokens=50\n\n )\n\n \n\n summary = response.choices[0].text.strip()\n\n print(summary)\n\nIn this example, we’re asking the `davinci` engine to summarize the text “Whisper is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervised data collected from the web. We show that the use of such a large and diverse dataset leads to improved robustness to accents, background noise and technical language. Moreover, it enables transcription in multiple languages, as well as translation from those languages into English. We are open-sourcing models and inference code to serve as a foundation for building useful applications and for further research on robust speech processing.” The API will return a summary that captures the most important information.\n\nFinally, you can use the OpenAI API for code generation. You can provide a natural language description of what you want your code to do, and the API will generate code that accomplishes that task. Here’s an example:\n\nimport openai\n\n openai.api_key = \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\n\n \n\n description = \"Create a Python script to sort a list of numbers in ascending order.\"\n\n response = openai.Completion.create(\n\n engine=\"davinci-003\",\n\n prompt=f\"Code generation:\n\n{description}\",\n\n max_tokens=100\n\n )\n\n \n\n code = response.choices[0].text.strip()\n\n print(code)\n\nIn this example, we’re asking the `davinci` engine to generate code that sorts a list of numbers in ascending order based on the natural language description “Sort a list of numbers in ascending order.” The API will return code that accomplishes that task.\n\nThe OpenAI API can also be used for building chatbots. You can provide some context and a user’s message, and the API will generate a response. Here’s an example:\n\nimport openai\n\n openai.api_key = \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\n\n \n\n context = \"You are chatting with a customer service representative.\"\n\n message = \"Hi, I have a problem with my account.\"\n\n response = openai.Completion.create(\n\n engine=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n\n prompt=f\"Chat:\n\n{context}\n\nUser: {message}\n\n\",\n\n max_tokens=50\n\n )\n\n \n\n reply = response.choices[0].text.strip()\n\n print(reply)\n\nIn this example, we’re asking the `ChatGPT` engine to generate a response to the user’s message “Hi, I have a problem with my account.” based on the context “You are chatting with a customer service representative.” The API will return a response that tries to help the user with their problem.\n\nIn this blog post, we covered the basics of using the OpenAI Python API. We started by discussing what OpenAI is and its importance in the field of artificial intelligence. We then went on to explain how to set up an OpenAI account and obtain an API key.\n\nNext, we explored some of the key features of the OpenAI API, such as the ability to generate text and complete prompts. We also discussed some best practices for working with the API, including how to handle rate limits and how to format your prompts for optimal results.\n\nOverall, the OpenAI Python API is a powerful tool that can be used to generate high-quality text for a variety of applications. Whether you are working on a chatbot, a content generation system, or any other project that requires natural language processing, the OpenAI API is definitely worth considering.\n\nAs always, there is much more to learn about this topic than we could cover in a single blog post. If you are interested in exploring further, be sure to check out the official OpenAI documentation and community forums for more information and support.\n\nThank you for reading, and happy coding!\n\nInterested in learning more?

        "document": "Python requests are generally used to fetch the content from a particular resource URL. Whenever we make a request to a specified URL through Python, it returns a response object. Now, this response object would be used to access certain features such as content, headers, etc. This article revolves around how to check the response.json() out of a response object. It is one of the most used methods in the requests module.\n\nHow to use response.json() using Python requests?\n\nresponse.json() is a part of the requests module in Python so, firstly we have to install the requests module in Python. response.json() is widely used to fetch data from APIs. In this article, we will explore how to use response.json() to load JSON data into Python objects.\n\nIn the below code, firstly we imported the requests module and then fetch the data from an API using requests.get() method and store in variable ‘response’. When we print the response it prints ‘<Response [200]>’ which is the HTTP code that indicates success. To print the JSON data fetched we have used json() method which prints the JSON data in the Python dictionary format as seen in the output. In this way, we can pas parse JSON responses in Python.\n\nIn the below code, we will parse the JSON data and print that data same as we access the keys and values of a dictionary. After making the get request to an API we store the JSON data in a variable “API_Data” using the response.json() method. Then we iterate over the JSON data using for loop and print the data by using the keys.\n\nHow to Pretty Print a JSON Object From Python Requests\n\nIn the below code, we will pretty print the JSON object that we got from an API using request.get() method. For that after converting the JSON object to the dictionary and stored into “response_dict” we will apply the json.dumps() method on data stored in “response_dict”. We will apply indentation on data by passing the argument “indent=4” and sorting the keys by setting “sort_keys=True” and then printing the data. We can see in the output that data is sorted in increasing order and with indentation.\n\nThere are many libraries to make an HTTP request in Python, which are httplib, urllib, httplib2, treq, etc., but requests are one of the best with cool features. If any attribute of requests shows NULL, check the status code using the below attribute.\n\nIf status_code doesn’t lie in the range of 200-29. You probably need to check the method begin used for making a request + the URL you are requesting for resources."

        "document": "Handling API requests and responses in Python can be a game-changer for your projects. Whether you're building a web application, a mobile app, or even a simple script, understanding how to interact with APIs is crucial. In this comprehensive guide, we'll dive deep into the world of Python requests and responses, giving you the tools you need to become an API master. And hey, don't forget to download Apidog for free - it will make your API development and testing a breeze!\n\nFirst things first, let's talk about what an API is. API stands for Application Programming Interface. It's a set of rules that allows different software entities to communicate with each other. Think of it as a waiter taking your order (your request) and bringing back your food (the response). APIs are everywhere – from weather apps to social media platforms.\n\nAPIs allow developers to access the functionality of other software programs. This can range from simple tasks, like fetching data from a web server, to more complex operations, like interacting with a machine learning model hosted on a cloud service.\n\nUsing APIs can save you a lot of time and effort. Instead of reinventing the wheel, you can leverage existing services and data. Plus, it allows your applications to be more versatile and integrated.\n\nBefore we dive in, here are some key terms you should know:\n• Endpoint: The URL where the API can be accessed.\n• Request: The message sent to the API to perform an action.\n• Response: The message the API sends back with the result of the request.\n• Status Code: A code that indicates the result of the request (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found).\n\nPython's library is a powerful tool for making HTTP requests. It's simple, yet very flexible, allowing you to interact with APIs effortlessly. Let's get started with installing the library.\n\nNow that we have the library installed, let's move on to making our first API request.\n\nTo make an API request, you'll need an API endpoint. For this example, we'll use the JSONPlaceholder API, a free fake online REST API for testing and prototyping.\n\nHere's a simple example of how to make a GET request:\n\nIn this example, we're sending a GET request to the endpoint. The function sends the request, and the response is stored in the variable. We then print the status code and the JSON response.\n\nThe response object contains all the information returned by the server. Here are some useful properties of the response object:\n• : The HTTP status code returned by the server.\n• : A method that parses the response body as JSON.\n\nSometimes, you'll need to send data to the API. This is where POST requests come in. Here's an example:\n\nIn this example, we're sending a POST request to the endpoint with some JSON data. The function sends the request, and the response is handled similarly to the GET request.\n\nNow that we've made some requests, let's talk about handling the responses. It's important to check the status code to ensure the request was successful.\n\nHere's a simple example of how to check the status code:\n\nIn this example, we're checking if the status code is , which indicates success. If the request was successful, we print the JSON response. Otherwise, we print an error message with the status code.\n\nMost APIs return data in JSON format. The method makes it easy to parse the JSON data. Here's an example:\n\nIn this example, we're parsing the JSON response and printing the and fields.\n\nError handling is crucial when working with APIs. You need to be prepared for various scenarios, such as network issues, invalid endpoints, and server errors.\n\nNetwork errors can occur when the server is unreachable or the connection is lost. The library provides built-in support for handling these errors using exceptions.\n\nIn this example, we're using a try-except block to catch different types of errors. The method raises an HTTPError if the status code is not 200.\n\nServer errors (status codes 500-599) indicate a problem on the server side. Here's an example of how to handle server errors:\n\nIn this example, we're checking if the status code is in the 500 range, which indicates a server error. We're also handling 404 (Not Found) and 400 (Bad Request) errors.\n\nNow that we've covered the basics, let's explore some advanced tips and tricks to make your life easier when working with APIs in Python.\n\nQuery parameters allow you to pass data to the API as part of the URL. Here's an example:\n\nIn this example, we're passing a parameter to the endpoint. The parameter of the function takes a dictionary of query parameters.\n\nHeaders are used to send additional information with the request. Here's an example:\n\nIn this example, we're setting the header to . The parameter of the function takes a dictionary of headers.\n\nMany APIs require authentication. The library supports various authentication methods, including Basic Auth and OAuth. Here's an example of how to use Basic Auth:\n\nIn this example, we're using Basic Auth to authenticate with the API. The parameter of the function takes an instance of .\n\nHow to Test Your Python POST Request\n\nApidog is a powerful tool for testing APIs. It allows you to create and save API requests, organize them into collections, and share them with your team.\n\nHere is how you can use Apidog to test your POST request:\n\n3. Enter the URL of the resource you want to update. Add any additional headers or parameters you want to include then click the “Send” button to send the request.\n\n4. Verify that the response is what you expected.\n\nIn this guide, we've covered the essentials of handling API requests and responses in Python. We've looked at making GET and POST requests, handling responses, and dealing with errors. We've also explored some advanced tips and tricks to make your life easier. Remember, APIs are a powerful tool that can open up a world of possibilities for your projects. So go ahead, experiment, and start building amazing things!\n\nAnd don't forget to download Apidog for free to streamline your API development and testing. Happy coding!"

So you have 2 solution: Check the file_2.text file and get a file that is correctly JSON, because this file is not. Or if you really can't get a JSON file, you can modify your code by inserting a request that applies to your file, because when you run your r (therefore a Requests) it makes assumptions about the encoding of the response based on the headers http. To change the encoding you can replace r.json () with r.text (), so like this:\n\nI noticed that you later changed the link in the question.

        "document": "This blog will explore how to effectively validate and assert responses in Python using the popular requests library. We will cover various techniques to verify the response structure, status codes, headers, and content of the responses, enabling you to test robust and reliable applications.\n\nStatus codes indicate the success or failure of an HTTP request.\n• import requests: This line imports the requests module, which is a popular Python library used to send HTTP requests.\n• BASE_URL = “https://reqres.in/\": It is the base URL for the API endpoint. In this case, the API endpoint is from the \"reqres.in\" website.\n• def test_validate_statuscode(): This line defines a test function named test_validate_statuscode. Test functions in pytest should start with the prefix \"test_\".\n• response = requests.get(BASE_URL + “api/users?page=2”): This line sends a GET request to the URL \"https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2\". The requests.get() function is used to perform the HTTP GET request, and the response is stored in the response variable.\n• assert response.status_code == 200, “Unexpected status code: “ + str(response.status_code): This line is the test assertion. It checks if the response status code is equal to 200 otherwise \"Unexpected status code” will be displayed.\n• For negative test case uses an invalid URL (“1/nonexistent”) to make the request, and the user should expect the status code to be 404.\n\n2. Asserting Response Headers: Response headers contain important information exchanged between the client and server. The below example explains how to validate response headers using the requests library.\n\ncontent_type = response. headers.get(“Content-Type”): This line retrieves the value of the “Content-Type” header from the response. The .get(“Content-Type”) method is used to get the value of the “Content-Type” header. If the header is not present in the response, content_type will be set to None.\n\nassert content_type == “application/json; charset=utf-8”, “Unexpected Content-Type: “ + content_type: This line is the test assertion. It checks if the “Content-Type” header in the response is equal to the expected value “application/json; charset=utf-8”. If the header value is not as expected, the test will fail, and an AssertionError will be raised with the custom message “Unexpected Content-Type”\n\n3. Verifying Response Content: This section focuses on the validation of response content. Some of the fields are checked as part of testing:\n\nimport requests\n\n\n\nBASE_URL = \"https://reqres.in/\"\n\n\n\ndef test_validate_json():\n\n response = requests.get(BASE_URL + \"api/users?page=2\")\n\n data = response.json()\n\n\n\n # Check if the response data is a dictionary\n\n assert isinstance(data, dict), \"Response data is not a dictionary\"\n\n\n\n # Check if the \"per_page\" key is present in the JSON response\n\n assert \"per_page\" in data, \"Expected 'per_page' key not found in the JSON response\"\n\n\n\n # Check if the value of the \"per_page\" key is an integer\n\n assert isinstance(data[\"per_page\"], int), \"'per_page' value is not an integer\"\n\n\n\n # Check if the \"data\" key is present in the JSON response\n\n assert \"data\" in data, \"Expected 'data' key not found in the JSON response\"\n\n\n\n # Check if the value of the \"data\" key is a list\n\n assert isinstance(data[\"data\"], list), \"'data' value is not a list\"\n\n\n\n # Check if the \"data\" list is not empty\n\n assert len(data[\"data\"]) > 0, \"'data' list is empty\"\n\n\n\n # Check if each item in the \"data\" list is a dictionary\n\n for item in data[\"data\"]:\n\n assert isinstance(item, dict), \"Item in 'data' list is not a dictionary\"\n• isinstance(data, dict): This part of the assertion uses the isinstance() function to check if the variable data is an instance of the Python dict type (dictionary).\n• Check if specific keys (“per_page” and “data”) are present in the JSON response.\n• Check if the values of these keys are of the expected types (integer for “per_page” and list for “data”).\n• Check if the “data” list is not empty.\n• Iterate through each item in the “data” list and check if each item is a dictionary.\n\n4. Handling Exceptions and Error Cases: It provides guidance on handling and gracefully responding to these exceptions using try-except blocks.\n• try: This line starts a try block, which is used to enclose the code that might raise an exception.\n• response = requests.get(BASE_URL + “api/users?page=2”): This line sends an HTTP GET request to the URL “https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2\" using the requests.get() function and stores the response in the response variable.\n• response.raise_for_status(): This line checks if the response contains an HTTP error status code (4xx or 5xx). If an error status code is present in the response, the raise_for_status() method will raise an exception. .\n• except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e: This line starts an except block, which is executed if an exception is raised within the try block. In this case, the except block handles requests.exceptions.RequestException exceptions, which is a base class for all exceptions raised by the requests library.\n• class APITestCase(unittest.TestCase):: This line defines a test case class named APITestCase that inherits from unittest.TestCase. In unittest, test cases are organized into classes, and each test method within the class represents an individual test case.\n• def test_status_code(self):: This line defines a test method named test_status_code within the APITestCase class. The test method is responsible for testing the status code of the API response.\n• self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200, “Unexpected status code”): This line is the test assertion. It checks if the status_code attribute of the response object is equal to 200.\n• if __name__ == “__main__”:: This line checks if the script is being run directly (not imported as a module).\n• unittest.main(): This line runs the tests using the unittest.main() function. When executed, it will discover all test cases and test methods within the script and run them.\n\nWe explored the essential techniques for validating and asserting responses in Python requests. By incorporating these practices into your projects, you can ensure data integrity, handle errors effectively, and test reliable applications.\n\nHere’s the GitHub link for the examples discussed above."
