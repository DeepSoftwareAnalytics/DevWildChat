Either way, you end up with working code. To start from scratch, move on to Starting with Spring Initializr. To skip the basics, do the following:\n• Download and unzip the source repository for this guide, or clone it using Git: When you finish, you can check your results against the code in .\n\nYou can use this pre-initialized project and click Generate to download a ZIP file. This project is configured to fit the examples in this tutorial.\n• Navigate to https://start.spring.io. This service pulls in all the dependencies you need for an application and does most of the setup for you.\n• Choose either Gradle or Maven and the language you want to use. This guide assumes that you chose Java.\n• Download the resulting ZIP file, which is an archive of a web application that is configured with your choices. If your IDE has the Spring Initializr integration, you can complete this process from your IDE. You can also fork the project from Github and open it in your IDE or other editor.\n\nTo start a Spring Boot MVC application, you first need a starter. In this sample, and are already added as dependencies. To upload files with Servlet containers, you need to register a class (which would be in web.xml). Thanks to Spring Boot, everything is auto-configured for you! All you need to get started with this application is the following class (from ): As part of auto-configuring Spring MVC, Spring Boot will create a bean and make itself ready for file uploads.\n\nThe initial application already contains a few classes to deal with storing and loading the uploaded files on disk. They are all located in the package. You will use those in your new . The following listing (from ) shows the file upload controller: The class is annotated with so that Spring MVC can pick it up and look for routes. Each method is tagged with or to tie the path and the HTTP action to a particular controller action.\n• : Looks up the current list of uploaded files from the and loads it into a Thymeleaf template. It calculates a link to the actual resource by using .\n• : Loads the resource (if it exists) and sends it to the browser to download by using a response header.\n• : Handles a multi-part message and gives it to the for saving. In a production scenario, you more likely would store the files in a temporary location, a database, or perhaps a NoSQL store (such as Mongo’s GridFS). It is best to NOT load up the file system of your application with content. You will need to provide a so that the controller can interact with a storage layer (such as a file system). The following listing (from ) shows that interface: You also need four classes to support the storage service: package com.example.uploadingfiles.storage; import java.io.IOException; import java.io.InputStream; import java.net.MalformedURLException; import java.nio.file.Files; import java.nio.file.Path; import java.nio.file.Paths; import java.nio.file.StandardCopyOption; import java.util.stream.Stream; import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired; import org.springframework.core.io.Resource; import org.springframework.core.io.UrlResource; import org.springframework.stereotype.Service; import org.springframework.util.FileSystemUtils; import org.springframework.util.StringUtils; import org.springframework.web.multipart.MultipartFile; @Service public class FileSystemStorageService implements StorageService { private final Path rootLocation; @Autowired public FileSystemStorageService(StorageProperties properties) { if(properties.getLocation().trim().length() == 0){ throw new StorageException(\"File upload location can not be Empty.\"); } this.rootLocation = Paths.get(properties.getLocation()); } @Override public void store(MultipartFile file) { try { if (file.isEmpty()) { throw new StorageException(\"Failed to store empty file.\"); } Path destinationFile = this.rootLocation.resolve( Paths.get(file.getOriginalFilename())) .normalize().toAbsolutePath(); if (!destinationFile.getParent().equals(this.rootLocation.toAbsolutePath())) { // This is a security check throw new StorageException( \"Cannot store file outside current directory.\"); } try (InputStream inputStream = file.getInputStream()) { Files.copy(inputStream, destinationFile, StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING); } } catch (IOException e) { throw new StorageException(\"Failed to store file.\", e); } } @Override public Stream<Path> loadAll() { try { return Files.walk(this.rootLocation, 1) .filter(path -> !path.equals(this.rootLocation)) .map(this.rootLocation::relativize); } catch (IOException e) { throw new StorageException(\"Failed to read stored files\", e); } } @Override public Path load(String filename) { return rootLocation.resolve(filename); } @Override public Resource loadAsResource(String filename) { try { Path file = load(filename); Resource resource = new UrlResource(file.toUri()); if (resource.exists() || resource.isReadable()) { return resource; } else { throw new StorageFileNotFoundException( \"Could not read file: \" + filename); } } catch (MalformedURLException e) { throw new StorageFileNotFoundException(\"Could not read file: \" + filename, e); } } @Override public void deleteAll() { FileSystemUtils.deleteRecursively(rootLocation.toFile()); } @Override public void init() { try { Files.createDirectories(rootLocation); } catch (IOException e) { throw new StorageException(\"Could not initialize storage\", e); } } }\n\nis a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:\n• : Tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.\n• : Tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings. For example, if is on the classpath, this annotation flags the application as a web application and activates key behaviors, such as setting up a .\n• : Tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the package, letting it find the controllers. The method uses Spring Boot’s method to launch an application. Did you notice that there was not a single line of XML? There is no file, either. This web application is 100% pure Java and you did not have to deal with configuring any plumbing or infrastructure. You can run the application from the command line with Gradle or Maven. You can also build a single executable JAR file that contains all the necessary dependencies, classes, and resources and run that. Building an executable jar makes it easy to ship, version, and deploy the service as an application throughout the development lifecycle, across different environments, and so forth. If you use Gradle, you can run the application by using . Alternatively, you can build the JAR file by using and then run the JAR file, as follows: If you use Maven, you can run the application by using . Alternatively, you can build the JAR file with and then run the JAR file, as follows: The steps described here create a runnable JAR. You can also build a classic WAR file. That runs the server-side piece that receives file uploads. Logging output is displayed. The service should be up and running within a few seconds. With the server running, you need to open a browser and visit to see the upload form. Pick a (small) file and press Upload. You should see the success page from the controller. If you choose a file that is too large, you will get an ugly error page. You should then see a line resembling the following in your browser window: “You successfully uploaded <name of your file>!”"
