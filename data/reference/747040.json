You can assign a role to an individual, and you can assign individuals to a role.\n• Assign a role to an individual. Assign one or more roles to an individual by opening a user’s profile in the administrator view. If a role does not meet the user’s existing license assignment, administrators can update the user to the appropriate license.\n• Assign people to a role. Assign roles to several people at once from the Manage Roles and Permissions page.\n\nNote: If the Division-Aware Role Management setting is enabled at the organization level, then admins must have the relevant permission on a per-division basis to provide role grants for users. For more information, see : If the Division-Aware Role Management setting is enabled at the organization level, then admins must have the relevant permission on a per-division basis to provide role grants for users. For more information, see Enable division-aware role management\n\nAssign a role and divisions to an individual\n• Find a user using search or by paging through the list.\n• Click More and from the menu that appears, click Edit Person.

To unlock the desired roles and permissions, you must assign the minimum required license. For more information about licenses, see Manage Licenses and Billing FAQs. The Divisions & Licenses tab helps administrators clarify options when configuring a user’s add-on options. If an add-on is available to the user, it appears on the Divisions & Licenses tab under Available Add-ons. When a user is assigned an add-on, an asterisk appears next to the user license. Hover over the asterisk to view the add-on:\n• Search for or navigate to the user for which you want to assign an add-on.\n• From the menu that appears, click Edit Person.\n• On the Divisions & Licenses tab, under Available Add-ons select the license to assign to this user."
