        "document": "There are several ways to present the output of a program; data can be printed in a human-readable form, or written to a file for future use. This chapter will discuss some of the possibilities.\n\nSo far we’ve encountered two ways of writing values: expression statements and the function. (A third way is using the method of file objects; the standard output file can be referenced as . See the Library Reference for more information on this.) Often you’ll want more control over the formatting of your output than simply printing space-separated values. There are several ways to format output.\n• None To use formatted string literals, begin a string with or before the opening quotation mark or triple quotation mark. Inside this string, you can write a Python expression between and characters that can refer to variables or literal values.\n• None The method of strings requires more manual effort. You’ll still use and to mark where a variable will be substituted and can provide detailed formatting directives, but you’ll also need to provide the information to be formatted. In the following code block there are two examples of how to format variables: Notice how the are padded with spaces and a negative sign only for negative numbers. The example also prints multiplied by 100, with 2 decimal places and followed by a percent sign (see Format Specification Mini-Language for details).\n• None Finally, you can do all the string handling yourself by using string slicing and concatenation operations to create any layout you can imagine. The string type has some methods that perform useful operations for padding strings to a given column width. When you don’t need fancy output but just want a quick display of some variables for debugging purposes, you can convert any value to a string with the or functions. The function is meant to return representations of values which are fairly human-readable, while is meant to generate representations which can be read by the interpreter (or will force a if there is no equivalent syntax). For objects which don’t have a particular representation for human consumption, will return the same value as . Many values, such as numbers or structures like lists and dictionaries, have the same representation using either function. Strings, in particular, have two distinct representations. The value of x is 32.5, and y is 40000... # The repr() of a string adds string quotes and backslashes: # The argument to repr() may be any Python object: The module contains a class that offers yet another way to substitute values into strings, using placeholders like and replacing them with values from a dictionary, but offers much less control of the formatting. Formatted string literals (also called f-strings for short) let you include the value of Python expressions inside a string by prefixing the string with or and writing expressions as . An optional format specifier can follow the expression. This allows greater control over how the value is formatted. The following example rounds pi to three places after the decimal: 'The value of pi is approximately The value of pi is approximately 3.142. Passing an integer after the will cause that field to be a minimum number of characters wide. This is useful for making columns line up. Other modifiers can be used to convert the value before it is formatted. applies , applies , and applies : 'My hovercraft is full of My hovercraft is full of eels. 'My hovercraft is full of My hovercraft is full of 'eels'. The specifier can be used to expand an expression to the text of the expression, an equal sign, then the representation of the evaluated expression: See self-documenting expressions for more information on the specifier. For a reference on these format specifications, see the reference guide for the Format Specification Mini-Language. Basic usage of the method looks like this: We are the knights who say \"Ni!\" The brackets and characters within them (called format fields) are replaced with the objects passed into the method. A number in the brackets can be used to refer to the position of the object passed into the method. If keyword arguments are used in the method, their values are referred to by using the name of the argument. Positional and keyword arguments can be arbitrarily combined: The story of Bill, Manfred, and Georg. If you have a really long format string that you don’t want to split up, it would be nice if you could reference the variables to be formatted by name instead of by position. This can be done by simply passing the dict and using square brackets to access the keys. This could also be done by passing the dictionary as keyword arguments with the notation. This is particularly useful in combination with the built-in function , which returns a dictionary containing all local variables: __name__: __main__; __doc__: None; __package__: None; __loader__: ... As an example, the following lines produce a tidily aligned set of columns giving integers and their squares and cubes: For a complete overview of string formatting with , see Format String Syntax. Here’s the same table of squares and cubes, formatted manually: # Note use of 'end' on previous line The method of string objects right-justifies a string in a field of a given width by padding it with spaces on the left. There are similar methods and . These methods do not write anything, they just return a new string. If the input string is too long, they don’t truncate it, but return it unchanged; this will mess up your column lay-out but that’s usually better than the alternative, which would be lying about a value. (If you really want truncation you can always add a slice operation, as in .) There is another method, , which pads a numeric string on the left with zeros. It understands about plus and minus signs: The % operator (modulo) can also be used for string formatting. Given (where format is a string), conversion specifications in format are replaced with zero or more elements of values. This operation is commonly known as string interpolation. For example: 'The value of pi is approximately The value of pi is approximately 3.142. More information can be found in the printf-style String Formatting section.\n\nreturns a file object, and is most commonly used with two positional arguments and one keyword argument: The first argument is a string containing the filename. The second argument is another string containing a few characters describing the way in which the file will be used. mode can be when the file will only be read, for only writing (an existing file with the same name will be erased), and opens the file for appending; any data written to the file is automatically added to the end. opens the file for both reading and writing. The mode argument is optional; will be assumed if it’s omitted. Normally, files are opened in text mode, that means, you read and write strings from and to the file, which are encoded in a specific encoding. If encoding is not specified, the default is platform dependent (see ). Because UTF-8 is the modern de-facto standard, is recommended unless you know that you need to use a different encoding. Appending a to the mode opens the file in binary mode. Binary mode data is read and written as objects. You can not specify encoding when opening file in binary mode. In text mode, the default when reading is to convert platform-specific line endings ( on Unix, on Windows) to just . When writing in text mode, the default is to convert occurrences of back to platform-specific line endings. This behind-the-scenes modification to file data is fine for text files, but will corrupt binary data like that in or files. Be very careful to use binary mode when reading and writing such files. It is good practice to use the keyword when dealing with file objects. The advantage is that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised at some point. Using is also much shorter than writing equivalent - blocks: # We can check that the file has been automatically closed. If you’re not using the keyword, then you should call to close the file and immediately free up any system resources used by it. Calling without using the keyword or calling might result in the arguments of not being completely written to the disk, even if the program exits successfully. After a file object is closed, either by a statement or by calling , attempts to use the file object will automatically fail. The rest of the examples in this section will assume that a file object called has already been created. To read a file’s contents, call , which reads some quantity of data and returns it as a string (in text mode) or bytes object (in binary mode). size is an optional numeric argument. When size is omitted or negative, the entire contents of the file will be read and returned; it’s your problem if the file is twice as large as your machine’s memory. Otherwise, at most size characters (in text mode) or size bytes (in binary mode) are read and returned. If the end of the file has been reached, will return an empty string ( ). 'This is the entire file.\n\n' reads a single line from the file; a newline character ( ) is left at the end of the string, and is only omitted on the last line of the file if the file doesn’t end in a newline. This makes the return value unambiguous; if returns an empty string, the end of the file has been reached, while a blank line is represented by , a string containing only a single newline. 'This is the first line of the file.\n\n' 'Second line of the file\n\n' For reading lines from a file, you can loop over the file object. This is memory efficient, fast, and leads to simple code: This is the first line of the file. If you want to read all the lines of a file in a list you can also use or . writes the contents of string to the file, returning the number of characters written. Other types of objects need to be converted – either to a string (in text mode) or a bytes object (in binary mode) – before writing them: returns an integer giving the file object’s current position in the file represented as number of bytes from the beginning of the file when in binary mode and an opaque number when in text mode. To change the file object’s position, use . The position is computed from adding offset to a reference point; the reference point is selected by the whence argument. A whence value of 0 measures from the beginning of the file, 1 uses the current file position, and 2 uses the end of the file as the reference point. whence can be omitted and defaults to 0, using the beginning of the file as the reference point. # Go to the 6th byte in the file # Go to the 3rd byte before the end In text files (those opened without a in the mode string), only seeks relative to the beginning of the file are allowed (the exception being seeking to the very file end with ) and the only valid offset values are those returned from the , or zero. Any other offset value produces undefined behaviour. File objects have some additional methods, such as and which are less frequently used; consult the Library Reference for a complete guide to file objects. Strings can easily be written to and read from a file. Numbers take a bit more effort, since the method only returns strings, which will have to be passed to a function like , which takes a string like and returns its numeric value 123. When you want to save more complex data types like nested lists and dictionaries, parsing and serializing by hand becomes complicated. Rather than having users constantly writing and debugging code to save complicated data types to files, Python allows you to use the popular data interchange format called JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). The standard module called can take Python data hierarchies, and convert them to string representations; this process is called serializing. Reconstructing the data from the string representation is called deserializing. Between serializing and deserializing, the string representing the object may have been stored in a file or data, or sent over a network connection to some distant machine. The JSON format is commonly used by modern applications to allow for data exchange. Many programmers are already familiar with it, which makes it a good choice for interoperability. If you have an object , you can view its JSON string representation with a simple line of code: Another variant of the function, called , simply serializes the object to a text file. So if is a text file object opened for writing, we can do this: To decode the object again, if is a binary file or text file object which has been opened for reading: JSON files must be encoded in UTF-8. Use when opening JSON file as a text file for both of reading and writing. This simple serialization technique can handle lists and dictionaries, but serializing arbitrary class instances in JSON requires a bit of extra effort. The reference for the module contains an explanation of this. Contrary to JSON, pickle is a protocol which allows the serialization of arbitrarily complex Python objects. As such, it is specific to Python and cannot be used to communicate with applications written in other languages. It is also insecure by default: deserializing pickle data coming from an untrusted source can execute arbitrary code, if the data was crafted by a skilled attacker."

The method is provided so that subclasses can override it.\n\nImplement checking for unused arguments if desired. The arguments to this function is the set of all argument keys that were actually referred to in the format string (integers for positional arguments, and strings for named arguments), and a reference to the args and kwargs that was passed to vformat. The set of unused args can be calculated from these parameters. check_unused_args() is assumed to raise an exception if the check fails.\n\nIf the index or keyword refers to an item that does not exist, then an IndexError or KeyError should be raised.\n\nSo for example, the field expression ‘0.name’ would cause get_value() to be called with a key argument of 0. The name attribute will be looked up after get_value() returns by calling the built-in getattr() function.\n\nFor compound field names, these functions are only called for the first component of the field name; subsequent components are handled through normal attribute and indexing operations.\n\nThe args parameter is set to the list of positional arguments to vformat() , and the kwargs parameter is set to the dictionary of keyword arguments.\n\nRetrieve a given field value. The key argument will be either an integer or a string.

Returns a tuple (obj, used_key). The default version takes strings of the form defined in PEP 3101 , such as “0[name]” or “label.title”. args and kwargs are as passed in to vformat() . The return value used_key has the same meaning as the key parameter to get_value() .\n\nThe values in the tuple conceptually represent a span of literal text followed by a single replacement field. If there is no literal text (which can happen if two replacement fields occur consecutively), then literal_text will be a zero-length string. If there is no replacement field, then the values of field_name, format_spec and conversion will be None .\n\nLoop over the format_string and return an iterable of tuples (literal_text, field_name, format_spec, conversion). This is used by vformat() to break the string into either literal text, or replacement fields.\n\nIn addition, the Formatter defines a number of methods that are intended to be replaced by subclasses:\n\nThis function does the actual work of formatting. It is exposed as a separate function for cases where you want to pass in a predefined dictionary of arguments, rather than unpacking and repacking the dictionary as individual arguments using the *args and **kwargs syntax. vformat() does the work of breaking up the format string into character data and replacement fields. It calls the various methods described below.\n\nThe primary API method. It takes a format string and an arbitrary set of positional and keyword arguments. It is just a wrapper that calls vformat() .\n\nThe built-in string class provides the ability to do complex variable substitutions and value formatting via the format() method described in PEP 3101 . The Formatter class in the string module allows you to create and customize your own string formatting behaviors using the same implementation as the built-in format() method.\n\nThe method and the class share the same syntax for format strings (although in the case of , subclasses can define their own format string syntax). The syntax is related to that of formatted string literals, but it is less sophisticated and, in particular, does not support arbitrary expressions.\n\nFormat strings contain “replacement fields” surrounded by curly braces . Anything that is not contained in braces is considered literal text, which is copied unchanged to the output. If you need to include a brace character in the literal text, it can be escaped by doubling: and .\n\nThe grammar for a replacement field is as follows:\n\nIn less formal terms, the replacement field can start with a field_name that specifies the object whose value is to be formatted and inserted into the output instead of the replacement field. The field_name is optionally followed by a conversion field, which is preceded by an exclamation point , and a format_spec, which is preceded by a colon . These specify a non-default format for the replacement value.\n\nSee also the Format Specification Mini-Language section.\n\nThe field_name itself begins with an arg_name that is either a number or a keyword. If it’s a number, it refers to a positional argument, and if it’s a keyword, it refers to a named keyword argument. An arg_name is treated as a number if a call to on the string would return true. If the numerical arg_names in a format string are 0, 1, 2, … in sequence, they can all be omitted (not just some) and the numbers 0, 1, 2, … will be automatically inserted in that order. Because arg_name is not quote-delimited, it is not possible to specify arbitrary dictionary keys (e.g., the strings or ) within a format string. The arg_name can be followed by any number of index or attribute expressions. An expression of the form selects the named attribute using , while an expression of the form does an index lookup using .\n\nThe conversion field causes a type coercion before formatting. Normally, the job of formatting a value is done by the method of the value itself. However, in some cases it is desirable to force a type to be formatted as a string, overriding its own definition of formatting. By converting the value to a string before calling , the normal formatting logic is bypassed.\n\nThree conversion flags are currently supported: which calls on the value, which calls and which calls .\n\nThe format_spec field contains a specification of how the value should be presented, including such details as field width, alignment, padding, decimal precision and so on. Each value type can define its own “formatting mini-language” or interpretation of the format_spec.\n\nMost built-in types support a common formatting mini-language, which is described in the next section.\n\nA format_spec field can also include nested replacement fields within it. These nested replacement fields may contain a field name, conversion flag and format specification, but deeper nesting is not allowed. The replacement fields within the format_spec are substituted before the format_spec string is interpreted. This allows the formatting of a value to be dynamically specified.\n\nSee the Format examples section for some examples.\n\n“Format specifications” are used within replacement fields contained within a format string to define how individual values are presented (see Format String Syntax and f-strings). They can also be passed directly to the built-in function. Each formattable type may define how the format specification is to be interpreted. Most built-in types implement the following options for format specifications, although some of the formatting options are only supported by the numeric types. A general convention is that an empty format specification produces the same result as if you had called on the value. A non-empty format specification typically modifies the result. The general form of a standard format specifier is: If a valid align value is specified, it can be preceded by a fill character that can be any character and defaults to a space if omitted. It is not possible to use a literal curly brace (” ” or “ ”) as the fill character in a formatted string literal or when using the method. However, it is possible to insert a curly brace with a nested replacement field. This limitation doesn’t affect the function. The meaning of the various alignment options is as follows: Forces the field to be left-aligned within the available space (this is the default for most objects). Forces the field to be right-aligned within the available space (this is the default for numbers). Forces the padding to be placed after the sign (if any) but before the digits. This is used for printing fields in the form ‘+000000120’. This alignment option is only valid for numeric types, excluding . It becomes the default for numbers when ‘0’ immediately precedes the field width. Forces the field to be centered within the available space. Note that unless a minimum field width is defined, the field width will always be the same size as the data to fill it, so that the alignment option has no meaning in this case. The sign option is only valid for number types, and can be one of the following: indicates that a sign should be used for both positive as well as negative numbers. indicates that a sign should be used only for negative numbers (this is the default behavior). indicates that a leading space should be used on positive numbers, and a minus sign on negative numbers. The option coerces negative zero floating-point values to positive zero after rounding to the format precision. This option is only valid for floating-point presentation types. Changed in version 3.11: Added the option (see also PEP 682). The option causes the “alternate form” to be used for the conversion. The alternate form is defined differently for different types. This option is only valid for integer, float and complex types. For integers, when binary, octal, or hexadecimal output is used, this option adds the respective prefix , , , or to the output value. For float and complex the alternate form causes the result of the conversion to always contain a decimal-point character, even if no digits follow it. Normally, a decimal-point character appears in the result of these conversions only if a digit follows it. In addition, for and conversions, trailing zeros are not removed from the result. The option signals the use of a comma for a thousands separator for floating-point presentation types and for integer presentation type . For other presentation types, this option is an error. For a locale aware separator, use the integer presentation type instead. Changed in version 3.1: Added the option (see also PEP 378). The option signals the use of an underscore for a thousands separator for floating-point presentation types and for integer presentation type . For integer presentation types , , , and , underscores will be inserted every 4 digits. For other presentation types, specifying this option is an error. Changed in version 3.6: Added the option (see also PEP 515). width is a decimal integer defining the minimum total field width, including any prefixes, separators, and other formatting characters. If not specified, then the field width will be determined by the content. When no explicit alignment is given, preceding the width field by a zero ( ) character enables sign-aware zero-padding for numeric types, excluding . This is equivalent to a fill character of with an alignment type of . Changed in version 3.10: Preceding the width field by no longer affects the default alignment for strings. The precision is a decimal integer indicating how many digits should be displayed after the decimal point for presentation types and , or before and after the decimal point for presentation types or . For string presentation types the field indicates the maximum field size - in other words, how many characters will be used from the field content. The precision is not allowed for integer presentation types. Finally, the type determines how the data should be presented. The available string presentation types are: String format. This is the default type for strings and may be omitted. The available integer presentation types are: Character. Converts the integer to the corresponding unicode character before printing. Hex format. Outputs the number in base 16, using lower-case letters for the digits above 9. Hex format. Outputs the number in base 16, using upper-case letters for the digits above 9. In case is specified, the prefix will be upper-cased to as well. Number. This is the same as , except that it uses the current locale setting to insert the appropriate number separator characters. In addition to the above presentation types, integers can be formatted with the floating-point presentation types listed below (except and ). When doing so, is used to convert the integer to a floating-point number before formatting. The available presentation types for and values are: Scientific notation. For a given precision , formats the number in scientific notation with the letter ‘e’ separating the coefficient from the exponent. The coefficient has one digit before and digits after the decimal point, for a total of significant digits. With no precision given, uses a precision of digits after the decimal point for , and shows all coefficient digits for . If , the decimal point is omitted unless the option is used. Scientific notation. Same as except it uses an upper case ‘E’ as the separator character. Fixed-point notation. For a given precision , formats the number as a decimal number with exactly digits following the decimal point. With no precision given, uses a precision of digits after the decimal point for , and uses a precision large enough to show all coefficient digits for . If , the decimal point is omitted unless the option is used. Fixed-point notation. Same as , but converts to and to . General format. For a given precision , this rounds the number to significant digits and then formats the result in either fixed-point format or in scientific notation, depending on its magnitude. A precision of is treated as equivalent to a precision of . The precise rules are as follows: suppose that the result formatted with presentation type and precision would have exponent . Then, if , where is -4 for floats and -6 for , the number is formatted with presentation type and precision . Otherwise, the number is formatted with presentation type and precision . In both cases insignificant trailing zeros are removed from the significand, and the decimal point is also removed if there are no remaining digits following it, unless the option is used. With no precision given, uses a precision of significant digits for . For , the coefficient of the result is formed from the coefficient digits of the value; scientific notation is used for values smaller than in absolute value and values where the place value of the least significant digit is larger than 1, and fixed-point notation is used otherwise. Positive and negative infinity, positive and negative zero, and nans, are formatted as , , , and respectively, regardless of the precision. General format. Same as except switches to if the number gets too large. The representations of infinity and NaN are uppercased, too. Number. This is the same as , except that it uses the current locale setting to insert the appropriate number separator characters. Percentage. Multiplies the number by 100 and displays in fixed ( ) format, followed by a percent sign. For this is like the type, except that when fixed-point notation is used to format the result, it always includes at least one digit past the decimal point, and switches to the scientific notation when . When the precision is not specified, the latter will be as large as needed to represent the given value faithfully. For , this is the same as either or depending on the value of for the current decimal context. The overall effect is to match the output of as altered by the other format modifiers. The result should be correctly rounded to a given precision of digits after the decimal point. The rounding mode for matches that of the builtin. For , the rounding mode of the current context will be used. The available presentation types for are the same as those for ( is not allowed). Both the real and imaginary components of a complex number are formatted as floating-point numbers, according to the specified presentation type. They are separated by the mandatory sign of the imaginary part, the latter being terminated by a suffix. If the presentation type is missing, the result will match the output of (complex numbers with a non-zero real part are also surrounded by parentheses), possibly altered by other format modifiers.\n\nThis section contains examples of the syntax and comparison with the old -formatting. In most of the cases the syntax is similar to the old -formatting, with the addition of the and with used instead of . For example, can be translated to . The new format syntax also supports new and different options, shown in the following examples. is formed from the real part 'The complex number (3-5j) is formed from the real part 3.0 and the imaginary part -5.0.'

See Reading and Writing Files for more examples of how to use this function. file is a path-like object giving the pathname (absolute or relative to the current working directory) of the file to be opened or an integer file descriptor of the file to be wrapped. (If a file descriptor is given, it is closed when the returned I/O object is closed unless closefd is set to .) mode is an optional string that specifies the mode in which the file is opened. It defaults to which means open for reading in text mode. Other common values are for writing (truncating the file if it already exists), for exclusive creation, and for appending (which on some Unix systems, means that all writes append to the end of the file regardless of the current seek position). In text mode, if encoding is not specified the encoding used is platform-dependent: is called to get the current locale encoding. (For reading and writing raw bytes use binary mode and leave encoding unspecified.) The available modes are: open for writing, truncating the file first open for exclusive creation, failing if the file already exists open for writing, appending to the end of file if it exists The default mode is (open for reading text, a synonym of ). Modes and open and truncate the file. Modes and open the file with no truncation. As mentioned in the Overview, Python distinguishes between binary and text I/O. Files opened in binary mode (including in the mode argument) return contents as objects without any decoding. In text mode (the default, or when is included in the mode argument), the contents of the file are returned as , the bytes having been first decoded using a platform-dependent encoding or using the specified encoding if given. Python doesn’t depend on the underlying operating system’s notion of text files; all the processing is done by Python itself, and is therefore platform-independent. buffering is an optional integer used to set the buffering policy. Pass 0 to switch buffering off (only allowed in binary mode), 1 to select line buffering (only usable when writing in text mode), and an integer > 1 to indicate the size in bytes of a fixed-size chunk buffer. Note that specifying a buffer size this way applies for binary buffered I/O, but (i.e., files opened with ) would have another buffering. To disable buffering in , consider using the flag for . When no buffering argument is given, the default buffering policy works as follows:\n• None Binary files are buffered in fixed-size chunks; the size of the buffer is chosen using a heuristic trying to determine the underlying device’s “block size” and falling back on . On many systems, the buffer will typically be 4096 or 8192 bytes long.\n• None “Interactive” text files (files for which returns ) use line buffering. Other text files use the policy described above for binary files. encoding is the name of the encoding used to decode or encode the file. This should only be used in text mode. The default encoding is platform dependent (whatever returns), but any text encoding supported by Python can be used. See the module for the list of supported encodings. errors is an optional string that specifies how encoding and decoding errors are to be handled—this cannot be used in binary mode. A variety of standard error handlers are available (listed under Error Handlers), though any error handling name that has been registered with is also valid. The standard names include:\n• None to raise a exception if there is an encoding error. The default value of has the same effect.\n• None ignores errors. Note that ignoring encoding errors can lead to data loss.\n• None causes a replacement marker (such as ) to be inserted where there is malformed data.\n• None will represent any incorrect bytes as low surrogate code units ranging from U+DC80 to U+DCFF. These surrogate code units will then be turned back into the same bytes when the error handler is used when writing data. This is useful for processing files in an unknown encoding.\n• None is only supported when writing to a file. Characters not supported by the encoding are replaced with the appropriate XML character reference .\n• None (also only supported when writing) replaces unsupported characters with escape sequences. newline determines how to parse newline characters from the stream. It can be , , , , and . It works as follows:\n• None When reading input from the stream, if newline is , universal newlines mode is enabled. Lines in the input can end in , , or , and these are translated into before being returned to the caller. If it is , universal newlines mode is enabled, but line endings are returned to the caller untranslated. If it has any of the other legal values, input lines are only terminated by the given string, and the line ending is returned to the caller untranslated.\n• None When writing output to the stream, if newline is , any characters written are translated to the system default line separator, . If newline is or , no translation takes place. If newline is any of the other legal values, any characters written are translated to the given string. If closefd is and a file descriptor rather than a filename was given, the underlying file descriptor will be kept open when the file is closed. If a filename is given closefd must be (the default); otherwise, an error will be raised. A custom opener can be used by passing a callable as opener. The underlying file descriptor for the file object is then obtained by calling opener with (file, flags). opener must return an open file descriptor (passing as opener results in functionality similar to passing ). The following example uses the dir_fd parameter of the function to open a file relative to a given directory: 'This will be written to somedir/spamspam.txt' The type of file object returned by the function depends on the mode. When is used to open a file in a text mode ( , , , , etc.), it returns a subclass of (specifically ). When used to open a file in a binary mode with buffering, the returned class is a subclass of . The exact class varies: in read binary mode, it returns an ; in write binary and append binary modes, it returns an , and in read/write mode, it returns an . When buffering is disabled, the raw stream, a subclass of , , is returned. See also the file handling modules, such as , (where is declared), , , , and . The and arguments may have been modified or inferred from the original call.\n• None used to be raised, it is now an alias of .\n• None is now raised if the file opened in exclusive creation mode ( ) already exists.\n• None The file is now non-inheritable.\n• None If the system call is interrupted and the signal handler does not raise an exception, the function now retries the system call instead of raising an exception (see PEP 475 for the rationale).\n• None On Windows, opening a console buffer may return a subclass of other than . Changed in version 3.11: The mode has been removed.\n\nReturn a proxy object that delegates method calls to a parent or sibling class of type. This is useful for accessing inherited methods that have been overridden in a class. The object_or_type determines the method resolution order to be searched. The search starts from the class right after the type. For example, if of object_or_type is and the value of type is , then searches . The attribute of the class corresponding to object_or_type lists the method resolution search order used by both and . The attribute is dynamic and can change whenever the inheritance hierarchy is updated. If the second argument is omitted, the super object returned is unbound. If the second argument is an object, must be true. If the second argument is a type, must be true (this is useful for classmethods). When called directly within an ordinary method of a class, both arguments may be omitted (“zero-argument ”). In this case, type will be the enclosing class, and obj will be the first argument of the immediately enclosing function (typically ). (This means that zero-argument will not work as expected within nested functions, including generator expressions, which implicitly create nested functions.) There are two typical use cases for super. In a class hierarchy with single inheritance, super can be used to refer to parent classes without naming them explicitly, thus making the code more maintainable. This use closely parallels the use of super in other programming languages. The second use case is to support cooperative multiple inheritance in a dynamic execution environment. This use case is unique to Python and is not found in statically compiled languages or languages that only support single inheritance. This makes it possible to implement “diamond diagrams” where multiple base classes implement the same method. Good design dictates that such implementations have the same calling signature in every case (because the order of calls is determined at runtime, because that order adapts to changes in the class hierarchy, and because that order can include sibling classes that are unknown prior to runtime). For both use cases, a typical superclass call looks like this: # This does the same thing as: In addition to method lookups, also works for attribute lookups. One possible use case for this is calling descriptors in a parent or sibling class. Note that is implemented as part of the binding process for explicit dotted attribute lookups such as . It does so by implementing its own method for searching classes in a predictable order that supports cooperative multiple inheritance. Accordingly, is undefined for implicit lookups using statements or operators such as . Also note that, aside from the zero argument form, is not limited to use inside methods. The two argument form specifies the arguments exactly and makes the appropriate references. The zero argument form only works inside a class definition, as the compiler fills in the necessary details to correctly retrieve the class being defined, as well as accessing the current instance for ordinary methods.

        "document": "Welcome to your complete guide to documenting Python code. Whether you’re documenting a small script or a large project, whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned Pythonista, this guide will cover everything you need to know.\n\nWe’ve broken up this tutorial into four major sections:\n• Why Documenting Your Code Is So Important: An introduction to documentation and its importance\n• Commenting vs Documenting Code: An overview of the major differences between commenting and documenting, as well as the appropriate times and ways to use commenting\n• Documenting Your Python Code Base Using Docstrings: A deep dive into docstrings for classes, class methods, functions, modules, packages, and scripts, as well as what should be found within each one\n• Documenting Your Python Projects: The necessary elements and what they should contain for your Python projects\n\nFeel free to read through this tutorial from beginning to end or jump to a section you’re interested in. It was designed to work both ways.\n\nWhy Documenting Your Code Is So Important Hopefully, if you’re reading this tutorial, you already know the importance of documenting your code. But if not, then let me quote something Guido mentioned to me at a recent PyCon: “Code is more often read than written.” When you write code, you write it for two primary audiences: your users and your developers (including yourself). Both audiences are equally important. If you’re like me, you’ve probably opened up old codebases and wondered to yourself, “What in the world was I thinking?” If you’re having a problem reading your own code, imagine what your users or other developers are experiencing when they’re trying to use or contribute to your code. Conversely, I’m sure you’ve run into a situation where you wanted to do something in Python and found what looks like a great library that can get the job done. However, when you start using the library, you look for examples, write-ups, or even official documentation on how to do something specific and can’t immediately find the solution. After searching, you come to realize that the documentation is lacking or even worse, missing entirely. This is a frustrating feeling that deters you from using the library, no matter how great or efficient the code is. Daniele Procida summarized this situation best: “It doesn’t matter how good your software is, because if the documentation is not good enough, people will not use it.“ In this guide, you’ll learn from the ground up how to properly document your Python code from the smallest of scripts to the largest of Python projects to help prevent your users from ever feeling too frustrated to use or contribute to your project.\n\nBefore we can go into how to document your Python code, we need to distinguish documenting from commenting. In general, commenting is describing your code to/for developers. The intended main audience is the maintainers and developers of the Python code. In conjunction with well-written code, comments help to guide the reader to better understand your code and its purpose and design: “Code tells you how; Comments tell you why.” Documenting code is describing its use and functionality to your users. While it may be helpful in the development process, the main intended audience is the users. The following section describes how and when to comment your code. Comments are created in Python using the pound sign ( ) and should be brief statements no longer than a few sentences. Here’s a simple example: According to PEP 8, comments should have a maximum length of 72 characters. This is true even if your project changes the max line length to be greater than the recommended 80 characters. If a comment is going to be greater than the comment char limit, using multiple lines for the comment is appropriate: # A very long statement that just goes on and on and on and on and # never ends until after it's reached the 80 char limit\n• Planning and Reviewing: When you are developing new portions of your code, it may be appropriate to first use comments as a way of planning or outlining that section of code. Remember to remove these comments once the actual coding has been implemented and reviewed/tested:\n• Code Description: Comments can be used to explain the intent of specific sections of code:\n• Algorithmic Description: When algorithms are used, especially complicated ones, it can be useful to explain how the algorithm works or how it’s implemented within your code. It may also be appropriate to describe why a specific algorithm was selected over another.\n• Tagging: The use of tagging can be used to label specific sections of code where known issues or areas of improvement are located. Some examples are: , , and . # TODO: Add condition for when val is None Comments to your code should be kept brief and focused. Avoid using long comments when possible. Additionally, you should use the following four essential rules as suggested by Jeff Atwood:\n• Keep comments as close to the code being described as possible. Comments that aren’t near their describing code are frustrating to the reader and easily missed when updates are made.\n• Don’t use complex formatting (such as tables or ASCII figures). Complex formatting leads to distracting content and can be difficult to maintain over time.\n• Don’t include redundant information. Assume the reader of the code has a basic understanding of programming principles and language syntax.\n• Design your code to comment itself. The easiest way to understand code is by reading it. When you design your code using clear, easy-to-understand concepts, the reader will be able to quickly conceptualize your intent. Remember that comments are designed for the reader, including yourself, to help guide them in understanding the purpose and design of the software. Type hinting was added to Python 3.5 and is an additional form to help the readers of your code. In fact, it takes Jeff’s fourth suggestion from above to the next level. It allows the developer to design and explain portions of their code without commenting. Here’s a quick example: From examining the type hinting, you can immediately tell that the function expects the input to be of a type , or string. You can also tell that the expected output of the function will be of a type , or string, as well. While type hinting helps reduce comments, take into consideration that doing so may also make extra work when you are creating or updating your project documentation. You can learn more about type hinting and type checking from this video created by Dan Bader.\n\nNow that we’ve learned about commenting, let’s take a deep dive into documenting a Python code base. In this section, you’ll learn about docstrings and how to use them for documentation. This section is further divided into the following sub-sections:\n• Docstrings Background: A background on how docstrings work internally within Python\n• Docstring Types: The various docstring “types” (function, class, class method, module, package, and script)\n• Docstring Formats: The different docstring “formats” (Google, NumPy/SciPy, reStructuredText, and Epytext) Documenting your Python code is all centered on docstrings. These are built-in strings that, when configured correctly, can help your users and yourself with your project’s documentation. Along with docstrings, Python also has the built-in function that prints out the objects docstring to the console. Here’s a quick example: Help on class str in module builtins: | Create a new string object from the given object. If encoding or | errors are specified, then the object must expose a data buffer | that will be decoded using the given encoding and error handler. | Otherwise, returns the result of object.__str__() (if defined) How is this output generated? Since everything in Python is an object, you can examine the directory of the object using the command. Let’s do that and see what find: Within that directory output, there’s an interesting property, . If you examine that property, you’ll discover this: Create a new string object from the given object. If encoding or errors are specified, then the object must expose a data buffer that will be decoded using the given encoding and error handler. Otherwise, returns the result of object.__str__() (if defined) Voilà! You’ve found where docstrings are stored within the object. This means that you can directly manipulate that property. However, there are restrictions for builtins: \"I'm a little string doc! Short and stout; here is my input and print me for my out\" File , line , in : Any other custom object can be manipulated: , is it me you're looking for?\" \"A simple function that says hello... Richie style\" Help on function say_hello in module __main__: A simple function that says hello... Richie style Python has one more feature that simplifies docstring creation. Instead of directly manipulating the property, the strategic placement of the string literal directly below the object will automatically set the value. Here’s what happens with the same example as above: \"\"\"A simple function that says hello... Richie style\"\"\" , is it me you're looking for?\" Help on function say_hello in module __main__: A simple function that says hello... Richie style There you go! Now you understand the background of docstrings. Now it’s time to learn about the different types of docstrings and what information they should contain. Docstring conventions are described within PEP 257. Their purpose is to provide your users with a brief overview of the object. They should be kept concise enough to be easy to maintain but still be elaborate enough for new users to understand their purpose and how to use the documented object. In all cases, the docstrings should use the triple-double quote ( ) string format. This should be done whether the docstring is multi-lined or not. At a bare minimum, a docstring should be a quick summary of whatever is it you’re describing and should be contained within a single line: \"\"\"This is a quick summary line used as a description of the object.\"\"\" Multi-lined docstrings are used to further elaborate on the object beyond the summary. All multi-lined docstrings have the following parts:\n• Any further elaboration for the docstring \"\"\"This is the summary line This is the further elaboration of the docstring. Within this section, you can elaborate further on details as appropriate for the situation. Notice that the summary and the elaboration is separated by a blank new # Notice the blank line above. Code should continue on this line. All docstrings should have the same max character length as comments (72 characters). Docstrings can be further broken up into three major categories: Class Docstrings are created for the class itself, as well as any class methods. The docstrings are placed immediately following the class or class method indented by one level: Class docstrings should contain the following information:\n• A brief summary of its purpose and behavior\n• Any public methods, along with a brief description\n• Anything related to the interface for subclassers, if the class is intended to be subclassed The class constructor parameters should be documented within the class method docstring. Individual methods should be documented using their individual docstrings. Class method docstrings should contain the following:\n• A brief description of what the method is and what it’s used for\n• Any arguments (both required and optional) that are passed including keyword arguments\n• Label any arguments that are considered optional or have a default value\n• Any side effects that occur when executing the method\n• Any exceptions that are raised\n• Any restrictions on when the method can be called Let’s take a simple example of a data class that represents an Animal. This class will contain a few class properties, instance properties, a , and a single instance method: A class used to represent an Animal a formatted string to print out what the animal says the sound that the animal makes the number of legs the animal has (default 4) Prints the animals name and what sound it makes The number of legs the animal (default is 4) \"\"\"Prints what the animals name is and what sound it makes. If the argument `sound` isn't passed in, the default Animal The sound the animal makes (default is None) If no sound is set for the animal or passed in as a Package docstrings should be placed at the top of the package’s file. This docstring should list the modules and sub-packages that are exported by the package. Module docstrings are similar to class docstrings. Instead of classes and class methods being documented, it’s now the module and any functions found within. Module docstrings are placed at the top of the file even before any imports. Module docstrings should include the following:\n• A brief description of the module and its purpose\n• A list of any classes, exception, functions, and any other objects exported by the module The docstring for a module function should include the same items as a class method:\n• A brief description of what the function is and what it’s used for\n• Any arguments (both required and optional) that are passed including keyword arguments\n• Label any arguments that are considered optional\n• Any side effects that occur when executing the function\n• Any exceptions that are raised\n• Any restrictions on when the function can be called Scripts are considered to be single file executables run from the console. Docstrings for scripts are placed at the top of the file and should be documented well enough for users to be able to have a sufficient understanding of how to use the script. It should be usable for its “usage” message, when the user incorrectly passes in a parameter or uses the option. If you use , then you can omit parameter-specific documentation, assuming it’s correctly been documented within the parameter of the function. It is recommended to use the for the parameter within ’s constructor. Check out our tutorial on Command-Line Parsing Libraries for more details on how to use and other common command line parsers. Finally, any custom or third-party imports should be listed within the docstrings to allow users to know which packages may be required for running the script. Here’s an example of a script that is used to simply print out the column headers of a spreadsheet: This script allows the user to print to the console all columns in the spreadsheet. It is assumed that the first row of the spreadsheet is the This tool accepts comma separated value files (.csv) as well as excel This script requires that `pandas` be installed within the Python environment you are running this script in. This file can also be imported as a module and contains the following * get_spreadsheet_cols - returns the column headers of the file * main - the main function of the script \"\"\"Gets and prints the spreadsheet's header columns The file location of the spreadsheet A flag used to print the columns to the console (default is a list of strings used that are the header columns \"The spreadsheet file to pring the columns of\" You may have noticed that, throughout the examples given in this tutorial, there has been specific formatting with common elements: , , and . There are specific docstrings formats that can be used to help docstring parsers and users have a familiar and known format. The formatting used within the examples in this tutorial are NumPy/SciPy-style docstrings. Some of the most common formats are the following: Official Python documentation standard; Not beginner friendly but feature rich The selection of the docstring format is up to you, but you should stick with the same format throughout your document/project. The following are examples of each type to give you an idea of how each documentation format looks. \"\"\"Gets and prints the spreadsheet's header columns file_loc (str): The file location of the spreadsheet print_cols (bool): A flag used to print the columns to the console \"\"\"Gets and prints the spreadsheet's header columns :param file_loc: The file location of the spreadsheet :param print_cols: A flag used to print the columns to the console \"\"\"Gets and prints the spreadsheet's header columns The file location of the spreadsheet A flag used to print the columns to the console (default is False) \"\"\"Gets and prints the spreadsheet's header columns @param file_loc: The file location of the spreadsheet @param print_cols: A flag used to print the columns to the console"

        "document": "Receiving user input is fundamental in Python programming, allowing developers to build interactive applications. Whether you’re working on command-line scripts, GUI-based applications, or web applications, handling user input correctly ensures efficient and secure software.\n\nIn this tutorial you will learn various ways to receive user input in Python, including the input() function, command-line arguments, GUI-based input handling, and best practices for validation and error handling.\n\nThe simplest way to receive user input is through Python’s built-in function. It reads a string from the keyboard and returns it.\n\nSince returns a string, you must convert it to an integer when necessary:\n\nWhen dealing with numerical inputs that require decimal precision, such as prices or measurements, you need to convert the user’s input to a floating-point number. This is achieved using the function, which converts a string to a floating-point number.\n\nHere’s an example of how to handle float input in Python:\n\nWhen dealing with user input, it’s essential to handle potential errors that may occur when users enter invalid data. One effective way to do this is by using blocks. This approach allows you to catch and manage exceptions that might be raised during the input process, ensuring your program remains robust and user-friendly.\n\nFor learning more about handling different data types, check out our tutorial on Python Data Types.\n\nWhen working with user input, it’s common to require multiple values from the user. Python provides a convenient way to handle this using the method, which divides a string into a list of substrings based on a specified separator. In the case of user input, we can use to separate multiple values entered by the user.\n\nHere’s an example of how to use to receive two string inputs from the user:\n\nHowever, if you need to perform numerical operations on these inputs, you’ll need to convert them to numerical types. This can be achieved using the function, which applies a given function to each item of an iterable (in this case, the list of strings returned by ). Here’s how to modify the previous example to convert the inputs to integers:\n\nBy using to convert the inputs to integers, you can perform arithmetic operations on them as needed.\n\nWhen executing a Python script from the command line, it’s often necessary to pass additional information or parameters to the script. This is achieved through command-line arguments, which are values provided after the script name when running it. Python’s method allows you to access these arguments within your script.\n\nHere’s an example of how to use to read command-line arguments:\n\nSave the following script as :\n\nTo run the script with arguments, use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:\n\nIn this example, and are the arguments passed to the script. The script will output the script name and the arguments provided.\n\nUnderstanding how to work with command-line arguments is essential for creating scripts that can be easily customized or configured without modifying the script itself. This approach is particularly useful for scripts that need to perform different tasks based on user input or configuration.\n\nWhen building graphical user interface (GUI) applications, Python offers a range of libraries to facilitate interactive input handling. One of the most popular and easy-to-use GUI frameworks is Tkinter, which is included in the Python standard library. allows you to create simple GUI applications with a minimal amount of code.\n\nHere’s an example of how to use to receive user input in a GUI application:\n\nThis example demonstrates how to create a simple GUI application that prompts the user for input, processes that input, and displays it back to the user.\n\nWhen working with user input in Python, it’s essential to follow best practices to ensure your application is robust, secure, and user-friendly. User input can come in various forms, such as command-line arguments, input from files, or interactive input from users. Here are five key guidelines to keep in mind, along with example code to illustrate each point:\n\nValidating user input is crucial to prevent errors and ensure that the data received is in the expected format. This can be achieved using blocks to catch and handle exceptions that may occur during input processing. For instance, when asking the user to enter an integer, you can use a block to handle cases where the user enters a non-integer value.\n\nImplementing error handling mechanisms is vital to prevent application crashes and provide a better user experience. blocks can be used to catch and handle errors in a way that doesn’t disrupt the application’s flow. For example, when reading from a file, you can use a block to handle cases where the file does not exist or cannot be read.\n\nLimiting the length of user input can help prevent unexpected behavior, such as buffer overflow attacks or excessive memory usage. This can be achieved by using string slicing or other methods to truncate input strings beyond a certain length. For instance, when asking the user to enter a username, you can limit the input length to 20 characters.\n\nSanitizing user input is critical to prevent security risks, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS). This involves removing or escaping special characters that could be used maliciously. Python’s module provides a convenient way to escape HTML characters in user input. For example, when displaying user input on a web page, you can use to prevent XSS attacks.\n\nProviding default values for user input can significantly improve usability by reducing the amount of information users need to provide. This can be achieved using the operator to assign a default value if the user input is empty or invalid. For instance, when asking the user to enter their name, you can provide a default value of “Guest” if the user does not enter a name.\n\nBy following these best practices, you can ensure that your Python application handles user input in a way that is secure, efficient, and user-friendly.\n\n1. How do I receive user input in Python?\n\nReceiving user input is a fundamental aspect of any interactive program. In Python, you can use the built-in function to prompt the user for input and store their response in a variable. Here’s a simple example:\n\n2. How do I get integer input from a user in Python?\n\nTo get integer input from a user in Python, you can use a loop to repeatedly prompt the user for input until a valid integer is entered. Here’s an example code block that demonstrates this:\n\nThis code block ensures that the program will continue to prompt the user for input until a valid integer is entered, making it a robust way to handle user input in Python.\n\n3. Can I receive multiple user inputs at once in Python?\n\nYes, you can receive multiple user inputs at once in Python. One way to do this is by using the method to divide the input string into multiple parts based on a specified separator, such as a space. The function can then be used to convert each part into the desired data type, such as an integer.\n\nHere’s an example code block that demonstrates how to receive two integer inputs from the user at once:\n\n4. How can I handle command-line arguments instead of ?\n\nWhen running a Python script from the command line, you can pass arguments to the script. These arguments are stored in the list. The first element of this list, , is the script name itself. The rest of the elements are the arguments passed to the script.\n\nHere’s an example of how you can handle command-line arguments in your Python script:\n\nIn this example, the script checks if any arguments were provided by checking the length of . If there are more than one elements in (i.e., at least one argument was provided), it prints the arguments received. If not, it informs the user that no arguments were provided.\n\nThis approach is particularly useful when you want to make your script more flexible and allow users to customize its behavior by passing arguments from the command line.\n\n5. How do you take input in Python?\n\nIn Python, you can take input from the user using the function. This function returns a string, which can be stored in a variable for further processing. Here’s an example:\n\nThis code prompts the user to enter their name and then prints a greeting message with their name.\n\n6. How do you take input from a variable in Python?\n\nIn Python, you cannot directly take input from a variable. Variables are used to store values, not to receive input. However, you can use a variable to store the input received from the user using the function. For example:\n\nIn this example, the variable stores the input received from the user, and then it is used to print a greeting message.\n\n7. How to input a number in Python?\n\nTo input a number in Python, you can use the function and convert the input string to an integer or float using the or function, respectively. Here’s an example:\n\nThis code prompts the user to enter their age, converts the input to an integer, and then prints a message with their age.\n\nThis tutorial covered multiple ways to receive user input in Python, from basic terminal input to command-line arguments and GUI-based interactions. By implementing input validation and error handling, you can create robust and user-friendly Python applications.\n\nFor more Python tutorials, check out:"
