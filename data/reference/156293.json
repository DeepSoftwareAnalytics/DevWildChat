        "document": "In this part of the tutorial, we will investigate how to speed up certain functions operating on pandas using Cython, Numba and . Generally, using Cython and Numba can offer a larger speedup than using but will require a lot more code.\n\nFor many use cases writing pandas in pure Python and NumPy is sufficient. In some computationally heavy applications however, it can be possible to achieve sizable speed-ups by offloading work to cython. This tutorial assumes you have refactored as much as possible in Python, for example by trying to remove for-loops and making use of NumPy vectorization. It’s always worth optimising in Python first. This tutorial walks through a “typical” process of cythonizing a slow computation. We use an example from the Cython documentation but in the context of pandas. Our final cythonized solution is around 100 times faster than the pure Python solution. We have a to which we want to apply a function row-wise. We achieve our result by using (row-wise): df.apply(lambda x: integrate_f(x[\"a\"], x[\"b\"], x[\"N\"]), axis=1) 84 ms +- 1.01 ms per loop (mean +- std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each) Let’s take a look and see where the time is spent during this operation using the prun ipython magic function: -l 4 df.apply(lambda x: integrate_f(x[\"a\"], x[\"b\"], x[\"N\"]), axis=1) # noqa E999 List reduced from 163 to 4 due to restriction <4> By far the majority of time is spend inside either or , hence we’ll concentrate our efforts cythonizing these two functions. First we’re going to need to import the Cython magic function to IPython: Now, let’s simply copy our functions over to Cython: df.apply(lambda x: integrate_f_plain(x[\"a\"], x[\"b\"], x[\"N\"]), axis=1) 47.2 ms +- 366 us per loop (mean +- std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each) This has improved the performance compared to the pure Python approach by one-third. We can annotate the function variables and return types as well as use and to improve performance: cdef double f_typed(double x) except? -2: return x * (x - 1) cpdef double integrate_f_typed(double a, double b, int N): cdef int i cdef double s, dx s = 0 dx = (b - a) / N for i in range(N): s += f_typed(a + i * dx) return s * dx df.apply(lambda x: integrate_f_typed(x[\"a\"], x[\"b\"], x[\"N\"]), axis=1) 7.75 ms +- 23.9 us per loop (mean +- std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each) Annotating the functions with C types yields an over ten times performance improvement compared to the original Python implementation. When re-profiling, time is spent creating a from each row, and calling from both the index and the series (three times for each row). These Python function calls are expensive and can be improved by passing an . -l 4 df.apply(lambda x: integrate_f_typed(x[\"a\"], x[\"b\"], x[\"N\"]), axis=1) List reduced from 161 to 4 due to restriction <4> cimport numpy as np import numpy as np cdef double f_typed(double x) except? -2: return x * (x - 1) cpdef double integrate_f_typed(double a, double b, int N): cdef int i cdef double s, dx s = 0 dx = (b - a) / N for i in range(N): s += f_typed(a + i * dx) return s * dx cpdef np.ndarray[double] apply_integrate_f(np.ndarray col_a, np.ndarray col_b, np.ndarray col_N): assert (col_a.dtype == np.float64 and col_b.dtype == np.float64 and col_N.dtype == np.dtype(int)) cdef Py_ssize_t i, n = len(col_N) assert (len(col_a) == len(col_b) == n) cdef np.ndarray[double] res = np.empty(n) for i in range(len(col_a)): res[i] = integrate_f_typed(col_a[i], col_b[i], col_N[i]) return res /home/runner/micromamba/envs/test/lib/python3.10/site-packages/numpy/core/include/numpy/npy_1_7_deprecated_api.h:17:2: warning: #warning \"Using deprecated NumPy API, disable it with \" \"#define NPY_NO_DEPRECATED_API NPY_1_7_API_VERSION\" [-Wcpp] 17 | #warning \"Using deprecated NumPy API, disable it with \" \\ This implementation creates an array of zeros and inserts the result of applied over each row.

For more about and , see the Cython docs on compiler directives.\n\nAn alternative to statically compiling Cython code is to use a dynamic just-in-time (JIT) compiler with Numba. Numba allows you to write a pure Python function which can be JIT compiled to native machine instructions, similar in performance to C, C++ and Fortran, by decorating your function with . Numba works by generating optimized machine code using the LLVM compiler infrastructure at import time, runtime, or statically (using the included pycc tool). Numba supports compilation of Python to run on either CPU or GPU hardware and is designed to integrate with the Python scientific software stack. The compilation will add overhead to the runtime of the function, so performance benefits may not be realized especially when using small data sets. Consider caching your function to avoid compilation overhead each time your function is run. Numba can be used in 2 ways with pandas:\n• None Specify the keyword in select pandas methods\n• None Define your own Python function decorated with and pass the underlying NumPy array of or (using ) into the function If Numba is installed, one can specify in select pandas methods to execute the method using Numba. Methods that support will also have an keyword that accepts a dictionary that allows one to specify , and keys with boolean values to pass into the decorator. If is not specified, it defaults to unless otherwise specified. In terms of performance, the first time a function is run using the Numba engine will be slow as Numba will have some function compilation overhead. However, the JIT compiled functions are cached, and subsequent calls will be fast. In general, the Numba engine is performant with a larger amount of data points (e.g. 1+ million). # Run the first time, compilation time will affect performance -r 1 -n 1 roll.apply(f, engine='numba', raw=True) 1.23 s ± 0 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 1 run, 1 loop each) # Function is cached and performance will improve roll.apply(f, engine='numba', raw=True) 188 ms ± 1.93 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each) roll.apply(f, engine='cython', raw=True) 3.92 s ± 59 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each) If your compute hardware contains multiple CPUs, the largest performance gain can be realized by setting to to leverage more than 1 CPU. Internally, pandas leverages numba to parallelize computations over the columns of a ; therefore, this performance benefit is only beneficial for a with a large number of columns. roll.mean(engine=\"numba\", engine_kwargs={\"parallel\": True}) 347 ms ± 26 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each) roll.mean(engine=\"numba\", engine_kwargs={\"parallel\": True}) 201 ms ± 2.97 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each) A custom Python function decorated with can be used with pandas objects by passing their NumPy array representations with . compute_numba(df) 1000 loops, best of 3: 798 us per loop In this example, using Numba was faster than Cython. Numba can also be used to write vectorized functions that do not require the user to explicitly loop over the observations of a vector; a vectorized function will be applied to each row automatically. Consider the following example of doubling each observation: df[\"col1_doubled\"] = df[\"a\"].apply(double_every_value_nonumba) # noqa E501 1000 loops, best of 3: 797 us per loop df[\"col1_doubled\"] = df[\"a\"] * 2 1000 loops, best of 3: 233 us per loop df[\"col1_doubled\"] = double_every_value_withnumba(df[\"a\"].to_numpy()) 1000 loops, best of 3: 145 us per loop Numba is best at accelerating functions that apply numerical functions to NumPy arrays. If you try to a function that contains unsupported Python or NumPy code, compilation will revert object mode which will mostly likely not speed up your function. If you would prefer that Numba throw an error if it cannot compile a function in a way that speeds up your code, pass Numba the argument (e.g. ). For more on troubleshooting Numba modes, see the Numba troubleshooting page. Using (e.g. ) may result in a if the threading layer leads to unsafe behavior. You can first specify a safe threading layer before running a JIT function with . Generally if the you encounter a segfault ( ) while using Numba, please report the issue to the Numba issue tracker.\n\nThe top-level function implements performant expression evaluation of and . Expression evaluation allows operations to be expressed as strings and can potentially provide a performance improvement by evaluate arithmetic and boolean expression all at once for large . You should not use for simple expressions or for expressions involving small DataFrames. In fact, is many orders of magnitude slower for smaller expressions or objects than plain Python. A good rule of thumb is to only use when you have a with more than 10,000 rows. These operations are supported by :\n• None Arithmetic operations except for the left shift ( ) and right shift ( ) operators, e.g.,\n• None Boolean operations, e.g., df < df2 and df3 < df4 or not df_bool\n• None Simple variable evaluation, e.g., (this is not very useful) The following Python syntax is not allowed:\n• \n• None Neither simple or compound statements are allowed. This includes , , and . You must explicitly reference any local variable that you want to use in an expression by placing the character in front of the name. This mechanism is the same for both and . For example, If you don’t prefix the local variable with , pandas will raise an exception telling you the variable is undefined. When using and , this allows you to have a local variable and a column with the same name in an expression. # same as the previous expression will raise an exception if you cannot use the prefix because it isn’t defined in that context. SyntaxError: The '@' prefix is not allowed in top-level eval calls. please refer to your variables by name without the '@' prefix. In this case, you should simply refer to the variables like you would in standard Python. There are two different expression syntax parsers. The default parser allows a more intuitive syntax for expressing query-like operations (comparisons, conjunctions and disjunctions). In particular, the precedence of the and operators is made equal to the precedence of the corresponding boolean operations and . For example, the above conjunction can be written without parentheses. Alternatively, you can use the parser to enforce strict Python semantics. The same expression can be “anded” together with the word as well: \"df1 > 0 and df2 > 0 and df3 > 0 and df4 > 0\" The and operators here have the same precedence that they would in Python. There are two different expression engines. The engine is the more performant engine that can yield performance improvements compared to standard Python syntax for large . This engine requires the optional dependency to be installed. The engine is generally not useful except for testing other evaluation engines against it. You will achieve no performance benefits using with and may incur a performance hit. df1 + df2 + df3 + df4 7.3 ms +- 24.9 us per loop (mean +- std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each) pd.eval(\"df1 + df2 + df3 + df4\", engine=\"python\") 7.92 ms +- 70.6 us per loop (mean +- std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each) In addition to the top level function you can also evaluate an expression in the “context” of a . Any expression that is a valid expression is also a valid expression, with the added benefit that you don’t have to prefix the name of the to the column(s) you’re interested in evaluating. In addition, you can perform assignment of columns within an expression. This allows for formulaic evaluation. The assignment target can be a new column name or an existing column name, and it must be a valid Python identifier. A copy of the with the new or modified columns is returned, and the original frame is unchanged. Multiple column assignments can be performed by using a multi-line string. The equivalent in standard Python would be works well with expressions containing large arrays. df1 + df2 + df3 + df4 7.72 ms +- 56.9 us per loop (mean +- std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each) pd.eval(\"df1 + df2 + df3 + df4\") 2.89 ms +- 73.7 us per loop (mean +- std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each) pd.eval(\"(df1 > 0) & (df2 > 0) & (df3 > 0) & (df4 > 0)\") 9.32 ms +- 24.1 us per loop (mean +- std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each) df1 + df2 + df3 + df4 + s 12.7 ms +- 69.2 us per loop (mean +- std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each) pd.eval(\"df1 + df2 + df3 + df4 + s\") 3.61 ms +- 41.1 us per loop (mean +- std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each) # would parse to 1 & 2, but should evaluate to 2 # would parse to 3 | 4, but should evaluate to 3 # this is okay, but slower when using eval should be performed in Python. An exception will be raised if you try to perform any boolean/bitwise operations with scalar operands that are not of type or . Here is a plot showing the running time of as function of the size of the frame involved in the computation. The two lines are two different engines. You will only see the performance benefits of using the engine with if your has more than approximately 100,000 rows. This plot was created using a with 3 columns each containing floating point values generated using . Expressions that would result in an object dtype or involve datetime operations because of must be evaluated in Python space, but part of an expression can still be evaluated with . For example: The numeric part of the comparison ( ) will be evaluated by and the object part of the comparison ( ) will be evaluated by Python."

        "document": "pandas provides data structures for in-memory analytics, which makes using pandas to analyze datasets that are larger than memory datasets somewhat tricky. Even datasets that are a sizable fraction of memory become unwieldy, as some pandas operations need to make intermediate copies.\n\nThis document provides a few recommendations for scaling your analysis to larger datasets. It’s a complement to Enhancing performance, which focuses on speeding up analysis for datasets that fit in memory.\n\nSuppose our raw dataset on disk has many columns. To load the columns we want, we have two options. Option 1 loads in all the data and then filters to what we need. Option 2 only loads the columns we request. If we were to measure the memory usage of the two calls, we’d see that specifying uses about 1/10th the memory in this case. With , you can specify to limit the columns read into memory. Not all file formats that can be read by pandas provide an option to read a subset of columns.\n\nThe default pandas data types are not the most memory efficient. This is especially true for text data columns with relatively few unique values (commonly referred to as “low-cardinality” data). By using more efficient data types, you can store larger datasets in memory. Now, let’s inspect the data types and memory usage to see where we should focus our attention. The column is taking up much more memory than any other. It has just a few unique values, so it’s a good candidate for converting to a . With a , we store each unique name once and use space-efficient integers to know which specific name is used in each row. We can go a bit further and downcast the numeric columns to their smallest types using . In all, we’ve reduced the in-memory footprint of this dataset to 1/5 of its original size. See Categorical data for more on and dtypes for an overview of all of pandas’ dtypes.\n\nSome workloads can be achieved with chunking by splitting a large problem into a bunch of small problems. For example, converting an individual CSV file into a Parquet file and repeating that for each file in a directory. As long as each chunk fits in memory, you can work with datasets that are much larger than memory. Chunking works well when the operation you’re performing requires zero or minimal coordination between chunks. For more complicated workflows, you’re better off using other libraries. Suppose we have an even larger “logical dataset” on disk that’s a directory of parquet files. Each file in the directory represents a different year of the entire dataset. Now we’ll implement an out-of-core . The peak memory usage of this workflow is the single largest chunk, plus a small series storing the unique value counts up to this point. As long as each individual file fits in memory, this will work for arbitrary-sized datasets. Some readers, like , offer parameters to control the when reading a single file. Manually chunking is an OK option for workflows that don’t require too sophisticated of operations. Some operations, like , are much harder to do chunkwise. In these cases, you may be better switching to a different library that implements these out-of-core algorithms for you."

        "document": "\n• Vectorization is much faster than standard loops. Source: Droste 2019. Perhaps the most important rule is to avoid using loops in Pandas code. Looping over a Series or a DataFrame processes data one item or row/column at a time. Instead, operations should be vectorized. This means an operation should be performed on the entire Series or DataFrame row/column. Developers should think of all operations as matrix computations that can be parallelized. The worst or slowest approach is to use within a loop. A slightly better approach is to use that returns a tuple containing a row index and a Series for the row. Even better is to remove loops completely and use that takes as first argument a function that's applied to each row or column. This internally uses Cython iterators. By far, the best approach is to use vectorization. For example, if is a Series containing addresses, is applied to all items \"at once\". Register size and the computer's instruction set determines how many items can be parallelized.\n• For data manipulation, what are some techniques for faster code? Indices are commonly used in Pandas for lookup or merging two datasets. It's faster to merge based the index. For example, is faster than , given that and . When chaining multiple operations, the order is important. For example, it's faster to filter first and then merge. Thus, is faster than .\n• What are some best practices for handling datetime data type? In general, adopt vectorization over explicit loops. If this is not possible, prefer , or in that order. If datetime values are stored as object data type, use method to convert to datetime type. Explicitly passing argument to this method speeds up the conversion. In electricity billing, suppose different tariffs are applied based on time of the day. We can use to selectively apply the tariff to data subsets. An even better way is to use . We can reduce execution time further by converting data to NumPy arrays. In this example, it's also convenient to use the datetime column as the index.\n• What are some techniques to improve Pandas performance? There are a few known techniques to speed up Pandas:\n• Cython: Cython is a superset of Python. It's Python code with additional type information. This is translated into optimized C/C++ code and then compiled as Python extension modules. Passing NumPy ndarray (rather than creating and passing Pandas Series) into Cython functions gives further improvement.\n• Numba: This is a just-in-time ( ) compiler. With a few annotations to Python code ( , , etc), runtime performance can come close to C/C++ or Fortran. There's support for both and hardware. However, as of Numba v0.20, optimizations work on NumPy arrays and not Pandas objects.\n• and : For datasets larger than 10,000 rows, , and evaluate expressions faster. Only some expressions can be optimized. For example, , , , comprehensions and generator expressions can't be optimized. Package numexpr needs to be installed. Pandas User Guide documents all the above techniques with useful code examples. Particularly for large datasets, Pandas official documentation recommends numexpr that uses multiple cores, smart chunking and caching; and bottleneck that uses Cython routines to speed up some types of evaluations.\n• How does Pandas compare against NumPy in terms of performance? On subsetting operation, NumPy outperforms Pandas by 10x to 1000x. Source: Żero 2020, fig. 1. NumPy is faster than Pandas because most of the calculations happen using precompiled optimized C code. Although Pandas makes use of NumPy, it does a lot of housekeeping: tracking data types and indices, and checking for errors. This makes Pandas slower than NumPy. Therefore, one way to speed up Pandas code is to convert critical computations into NumPy, for example by calling method. One study on selecting a data subset showed NumPy outperforming Pandas by 10x to 1000x, with the gains diminishing on very large datasets. Regardless of DataFrame size, Pandas paid an initial penalty 1ms. Similar results were seen when taking square root of numbers. Within NumPy, operations within an array are faster than operations that span multiple arrays. Thus, is slower than if we reorganize the data as and .\n• How do I deal with large datasets in Pandas? Pandas does in-memory analytics, which makes it difficult to handle large datasets that don't fit in system memory. One approach is to load less data, such as loading only columns needed for analysis. For example, has argument to do this. Use efficient datatypes. Text data of low cardinality are those with lot of values but only a few unique values. Storing each value as a complete string is memory inefficient. Instead, they should be stored as categorical data. Data with all unique values will not benefit from such a conversion. Numerical values can be downcast to smallest types using . Chunking is a technique to split the dataset and process in chunks. This works best when chunks require little coordination. Some methods such as has argument to do chunking. Group-by operations are typically harder to do in chunks. Where complex expressions are involved such as ), each sub-expression creates temporary memory. This can be avoided with , and . This improves performance only on large datasets.\n• How does Pandas store a DataFrame under the hood? DataFrames columns are grouped into blocks and managed by the BlockManager. Source: Tratner 2015, slide 36. Pandas groups columns of the same type into what is called a block. A DataFrame is actually stored as one or more blocks. Using metadata, these blocks are composed into a DataFrame by a BlockManager. Thus, only a block is contiguous in memory. It's possible to inspect the blocks using for column A. The output will also show values of other columns in that block. To see the internal storage of all blocks, call . Referring to the figure, slicing with doesn't involve data copy since both columns are of the same data type. But any cross-dtype slicing will typically involve copying. Another performance killer is appending a row to a DataFrame. This would result in reallocating memory and copying every block. Thus, it's better to concatenate two big datasets rather than append one to the other row by row. When a new column is added, block copy is deferred until an operation requires it.\n• Dask or PySpark can be suitable for large datasets. Source: Zhang 2019. Indexing involves lots of lookups. klib is a C implementation that uses less memory and runs faster than Python's dictionary lookup. Since version 0.16.2, Pandas already uses klib. To run on multiple cores, use multiprocessing, Modin, Ray, Swifter, Dask or Spark. In one study, Spark did best on reading/writing large datasets and filling missing values. Pandas did best for group-by operation. An advantage of Swifter is that it decides what to use (vectorization, Pandas apply or Dask) depending on the dataset size. Swifter can also be used along with Modin. In fact, Modin partitions data in an optimal way but can work with other libraries that perform parallel execution. Dask can use multiple threads or processes on a single machine or a cluster of machines. Combining Numba with Dask is even better. PySpark is suitable for very large datasets but Pandas offers better s. A suitable approach is to use Spark with Apache Arrow. Arrow is an in-memory columnar format that helps to efficiently transfer data between Spark and Pandas. Based on Arrow, PyPolars is a highly performant DataFrame library."

        "document": "The pandas DataFrame is a structure that contains two-dimensional data and its corresponding labels. DataFrames are widely used in data science, machine learning, scientific computing, and many other data-intensive fields.\n\nDataFrames are similar to SQL tables or the spreadsheets that you work with in Excel or Calc. In many cases, DataFrames are faster, easier to use, and more powerful than tables or spreadsheets because they’re an integral part of the Python and NumPy ecosystems.\n• What a pandas DataFrame is and how to create one\n• How to access, modify, add, sort, filter, and delete data\n• How to work with time-series data\n\nIt’s time to get started with pandas DataFrames!\n\npandas DataFrames are data structures that contain:\n• Data organized in two dimensions, rows and columns\n• Labels that correspond to the rows and columns You can start working with DataFrames by importing pandas: Now that you have pandas imported, you can work with DataFrames. Imagine you’re using pandas to analyze data about job candidates for a position developing web applications with Python. Say you’re interested in the candidates’ names, cities, ages, and scores on a Python programming test, or : In this table, the first row contains the column labels ( , , , and ). The first column holds the row labels ( , , and so on). All other cells are filled with the data values. Now you have everything you need to create a pandas DataFrame. There are several ways to create a pandas DataFrame. In most cases, you’ll use the constructor and provide the data, labels, and other information. You can pass the data as a two-dimensional list, tuple, or NumPy array. You can also pass it as a dictionary or pandas instance, or as one of several other data types not covered in this tutorial. For this example, assume you’re using a dictionary to pass the data: is a Python variable that refers to the dictionary that holds your candidate data. It also contains the labels of the columns: Finally, refers to a list that contains the labels of the rows, which are numbers ranging from to . That’s it! is a variable that holds the reference to your pandas DataFrame. This pandas DataFrame looks just like the candidate table above and has the following features:\n• Column labels such as , , , and\n• Data such as candidate names, cities, ages, and Python test scores This figure shows the labels and data from : The row labels are outlined in blue, whereas the column labels are outlined in red, and the data values are outlined in purple. pandas DataFrames can sometimes be very large, making it impractical to look at all the rows at once. You can use to show the first few items and to show the last few items: That’s how you can show just the beginning or end of a pandas DataFrame. The parameter specifies the number of rows to show. Note: It may be helpful to think of the pandas DataFrame as a dictionary of columns, or pandas Series, with many additional features. You can access a column in a pandas DataFrame the same way you would get a value from a dictionary: This is the most convenient way to get a column from a pandas DataFrame. If the name of the column is a string that is a valid Python identifier, then you can use dot notation to access it. That is, you can access the column the same way you would get the attribute of a class instance: That’s how you get a particular column. You’ve extracted the column that corresponds with the label , which contains the locations of all your job candidates. It’s important to notice that you’ve extracted both the data and the corresponding row labels: Each column of a pandas DataFrame is an instance of , a structure that holds one-dimensional data and their labels. You can get a single item of a object the same way you would with a dictionary, by using its label as a key: In this case, is the data value and is the corresponding label. As you’ll see in a later section, there are other ways to get a particular item in a pandas DataFrame. You can also access a whole row with the accessor : This time, you’ve extracted the row that corresponds to the label , which contains the data for the candidate named . In addition to the data values from this row, you’ve extracted the labels of the corresponding columns: The returned row is also an instance of .\n\nAs already mentioned, there are several way to create a pandas DataFrame. In this section, you’ll learn to do this using the constructor along with: There are other methods as well, which you can learn about in the official documentation. You can start by importing pandas along with NumPy, which you’ll use throughout the following examples: That’s it. Now you’re ready to create some DataFrames. As you’ve already seen, you can create a pandas DataFrame with a Python dictionary: The keys of the dictionary are the DataFrame’s column labels, and the dictionary values are the data values in the corresponding DataFrame columns. The values can be contained in a tuple, list, one-dimensional NumPy array, pandas object, or one of several other data types. You can also provide a single value that will be copied along the entire column. It’s possible to control the order of the columns with the parameter and the row labels with : As you can see, you’ve specified the row labels , , and . You’ve also forced the order of columns: , , . Another way to create a pandas DataFrame is to use a list of dictionaries: Again, the dictionary keys are the column labels, and the dictionary values are the data values in the DataFrame. You can also use a nested list, or a list of lists, as the data values. If you do, then it’s wise to explicitly specify the labels of columns, rows, or both when you create the DataFrame: That’s how you can use a nested list to create a pandas DataFrame. You can also use a list of tuples in the same way. To do so, just replace the nested lists in the example above with tuples. You can pass a two-dimensional NumPy array to the constructor the same way you do with a list: Although this example looks almost the same as the nested list implementation above, it has one advantage: You can specify the optional parameter . When is set to (its default setting), the data from the NumPy array isn’t copied. This means that the original data from the array is assigned to the pandas DataFrame. If you modify the array, then your DataFrame will change too: As you can see, when you change the first item of , you also modify . Note: Not copying data values can save you a significant amount of time and processing power when working with large datasets. If this behavior isn’t what you want, then you should specify in the constructor. That way, will be created with a copy of the values from instead of the actual values. You can save and load the data and labels from a pandas DataFrame to and from a number of file types, including CSV, Excel, SQL, JSON, and more. This is a very powerful feature. You can save your job candidate DataFrame to a CSV file with : The statement above will produce a CSV file called in your working directory: Now that you have a CSV file with data, you can load it with : That’s how you get a pandas DataFrame from a file. In this case, specifies that the row labels are located in the first column of the CSV file.\n\nNow that you’ve created your DataFrame, you can start retrieving information from it. With pandas, you can perform the following actions:\n• Retrieve and modify row and column labels as sequences You can get the DataFrame’s row labels with and its column labels with : Now you have the row and column labels as special kinds of sequences. As you can with any other Python sequence, you can get a single item: In addition to extracting a particular item, you can apply other sequence operations, including iterating through the labels of rows or columns. However, this is rarely necessary since pandas offers other ways to iterate over DataFrames, which you’ll see in a later section. You can also use this approach to modify the labels: In this example, you use to generate a new sequence of row labels that holds the integers from to . To learn more about , check out NumPy arange(): How to Use np.arange(). Keep in mind that if you try to modify a particular item of or , then you’ll get a . Sometimes you might want to extract data from a pandas DataFrame without its labels. To get a NumPy array with the unlabeled data, you can use either or : Both and work similarly, and they both return a NumPy array with the data from the pandas DataFrame: The pandas documentation suggests using because of the flexibility offered by two optional parameters:\n• : Use this parameter to specify the data type of the resulting array. It’s set to by default.\n• : Set this parameter to if you want to use the original data from the DataFrame. Set it to if you want to make a copy of the data. However, has been around for much longer than , which was introduced in pandas version 0.24.0. That means you’ll probably see more often, especially in older code. The types of the data values, also called data types or dtypes, are important because they determine the amount of memory your DataFrame uses, as well as its calculation speed and level of precision. pandas relies heavily on NumPy data types. However, pandas 1.0 introduced some additional types: You can get the data types for each column of a pandas DataFrame with : As you can see, returns a object with the column names as labels and the corresponding data types as values. If you want to modify the data type of one or more columns, then you can use : The most important and only mandatory parameter of is . It expects a data type or dictionary. If you pass a dictionary, then the keys are the column names and the values are your desired corresponding data types. As you can see, the data types for the columns and in the DataFrame are both , which represents 64-bit (or 8-byte) integers. However, also offers a smaller, 32-bit (4-byte) integer data type called . The attributes , , and return the number of dimensions, number of data values across each dimension, and total number of data values, respectively: instances have two dimensions (rows and columns), so returns . A object, on the other hand, has only a single dimension, so in that case, would return . The attribute returns a tuple with the number of rows (in this case ) and the number of columns ( ). Finally, returns an integer equal to the number of values in the DataFrame ( ). You can even check the amount of memory used by each column with : As you can see, returns a Series with the column names as labels and the memory usage in bytes as data values. If you want to exclude the memory usage of the column that holds the row labels, then pass the optional argument . In the example above, the last two columns, and , use 28 bytes of memory each. That’s because these columns have seven values, each of which is an integer that takes 32 bits, or 4 bytes. Seven integers times 4 bytes each equals a total of 28 bytes of memory usage.\n\nYou’ve already learned how to get a particular row or column of a pandas DataFrame as a object: In the first example, you access the column as you would access an element from a dictionary, by using its label as a key. If the column label is a valid Python identifier, then you can also use dot notation to access the column. In the second example, you use to get the row by its label, . In addition to the accessor , which you can use to get rows or columns by their labels, pandas offers the accessor , which retrieves a row or column by its integer index. In most cases, you can use either of the two: returns the row with the label . Similarly, returns the row with the zero-based index , which is the first row. As you can see, both statements return the same row as a object. pandas has four accessors in total:\n• accepts the labels of rows and columns and returns Series or DataFrames. You can use it to get entire rows or columns, as well as their parts.\n• accepts the zero-based indices of rows and columns and returns Series or DataFrames. You can use it to get entire rows or columns, or their parts.\n• accepts the labels of rows and columns and returns a single data value.\n• accepts the zero-based indices of rows and columns and returns a single data value. Of these, and are particularly powerful. They support slicing and NumPy-style indexing. You can use them to access a column: returns the column . The slice construct ( ) in the row label place means that all the rows should be included. returns the same column because the zero-based index refers to the second column, . Just as you can with NumPy, you can provide slices along with lists or arrays instead of indices to get multiple rows or columns: Note: Don’t use tuples instead of lists or integer arrays to get ordinary rows or columns. Tuples are reserved for representing multiple dimensions in NumPy and pandas, as well as hierarchical, or multi-level, indexing in pandas. In this example, you use:\n• Slices to get the rows with the labels through , which are equivalent to the indices through\n• Lists to get the columns and , which are equivalent to the indices and Both statements return a pandas DataFrame with the intersection of the desired five rows and two columns. This brings up a very important difference between and . As you can see from the previous example, when you pass the row labels to , you get the rows through . However, when you pass the row indices to , you only get the rows with the indices through . The reason you only get indices through is that, with , the stop index of a slice is exclusive, meaning it is excluded from the returned values. This is consistent with Python sequences and NumPy arrays. With , however, both start and stop indices are inclusive, meaning they are included with the returned values. You can skip rows and columns with the same way you can with slicing tuples, lists, and NumPy arrays: In this example, you specify the desired row indices with the slice . This means that you start with the row that has the index (the second row), stop before the row with the index (the seventh row), and skip every second row. Instead of using the slicing construct, you could also use the built-in Python class , as well as or : You might find one of these approaches more convenient than others depending on your situation. It’s possible to use and to get particular data values. However, when you need only a single value, pandas recommends using the specialized accessors and : Here, you used to get the name of a single candidate using its corresponding column and row labels. You also used to retrieve the same name using its column and row indices. You can use accessors to modify parts of a pandas DataFrame by passing a Python sequence, NumPy array, or single value: The statement modifies the first four items (rows through ) in the column using the values from your supplied list. Using sets the remaining values in this column to . The following example shows that you can use negative indices with to access or modify data: In this example, you’ve accessed and modified the last column ( ), which corresponds to the integer column index . This behavior is consistent with Python sequences and NumPy arrays.\n\npandas provides several convenient techniques for inserting and deleting rows or columns. You can choose among them based on your situation and needs. Imagine you want to add a new person to your list of job candidates. You can start by creating a new object that represents this new candidate: The new object has labels that correspond to the column labels from . That’s why you need . You can add as a new row to the end of with : Here, returns the pandas DataFrame with the new row appended. Notice how pandas uses the attribute , which is the value , to specify the label for the new row. You’ve appended a new row with a single call to , and you can delete it with a single call to : Here, removes the rows specified with the parameter . By default, it returns the pandas DataFrame with the specified rows removed. If you pass , then the original DataFrame will be modified and you’ll get as the return value. The most straightforward way to insert a column in a pandas DataFrame is to follow the same procedure that you use when you add an item to a dictionary. Here’s how you can append a column containing your candidates’ scores on a JavaScript test: Now the original DataFrame has one more column, , at its end. You don’t have to provide a full sequence of values. You can add a new column with a single value: The DataFrame now has an additional column filled with zeros. If you’ve used dictionaries in the past, then this way of inserting columns might be familiar to you. However, it doesn’t allow you to specify the location of the new column. If the location of the new column is important, then you can use instead: You’ve just inserted another column with the score of the Django test. The parameter determines the location, or the zero-based index, of the new column in the pandas DataFrame. sets the label of the new column, and specifies the data values to insert. You can delete one or more columns from a pandas DataFrame just as you would with a regular Python dictionary, by using the statement: Now you have without the column . Another similarity to dictionaries is the ability to use , which removes the specified column and returns it. That means you could do something like instead of using . You can also remove one or more columns with as you did previously with the rows. Again, you need to specify the labels of the desired columns with . In addition, when you want to remove columns, you need to provide the argument : You’ve removed the column from your DataFrame. By default, returns the DataFrame without the specified columns unless you pass .\n\nData filtering is another powerful feature of pandas. It works similarly to indexing with Boolean arrays in NumPy. If you apply some logical operation on a object, then you’ll get another Series with the Boolean values and : In this case, returns for those rows in which the Django score is greater than or equal to 80. It returns for the rows with a Django score less than 80. You now have the Series filled with Boolean data. The expression returns a pandas DataFrame with the rows from that correspond to in : As you can see, , , , and are , so contains the rows with these labels. On the other hand, , , and are , so the corresponding rows don’t appear in . You can create very powerful and sophisticated expressions by combining logical operations with the following operators: For example, you can get a DataFrame with the candidates whose and are greater than or equal to 80: The expression returns a Series with in the rows for which both and are greater than or equal to 80 and in the others. In this case, only the rows with the labels and satisfy both conditions. You can also apply NumPy logical routines instead of operators. For some operations that require data filtering, it’s more convenient to use . It replaces the values in the positions where the provided condition isn’t satisfied: In this example, the condition is . The values of the DataFrame or Series that calls will remain the same where the condition is and will be replaced with the value of (in this case ) where the condition is .\n\nMissing data is very common in data science and machine learning. But never fear! pandas has very powerful features for working with missing data. In fact, its documentation has an entire section dedicated to working with missing data. pandas usually represents missing data with NaN (not a number) values. In Python, you can get NaN with , , or . Starting with pandas 1.0, newer types like , , , , and use as a missing value. Here’s an example of a pandas DataFrame with a missing value: The variable refers to the DataFrame with one column, , and four values. The third value is and is considered missing by default. Many pandas methods omit values when performing calculations unless they are explicitly instructed not to: In the first example, calculates the mean without taking (the third value) into account. It just takes , , and and returns their average, which is 2.33. However, if you instruct not to skip values with , then it will consider them and return if there’s any missing value among the data. pandas has several options for filling, or replacing, missing values with other values. One of the most convenient methods is . You can use it to replace missing values with:\n• The values above the missing value\n• The values below the missing value Here’s how you can apply the options mentioned above: In the first example, replaces the missing value with , which you specified with . In the second example, replaces the missing value with the value above it, which is . In the third example, uses the value below the missing value, which is . Another popular option is to apply interpolation and replace missing values with interpolated values. You can do this with : As you can see, replaces the missing value with an interpolated value. You can also use the optional parameter with . Doing so will:\n• Create and return a new DataFrame when\n• Modify the existing DataFrame and return when The default setting for is . However, can be very useful when you’re working with large amounts of data and want to prevent unnecessary and inefficient copying. In certain situations, you might want to delete rows or even columns that have missing values. You can do this with : In this case, simply deletes the row with , including its label. It also has the optional parameter , which behaves the same as it does with and .\n\npandas excels at handling time series. Although this functionality is partly based on NumPy datetimes and timedeltas, pandas provides much more flexibility. In this section, you’ll create a pandas DataFrame using the hourly temperature data from a single day. You can start by creating a list (or tuple, NumPy array, or other data type) with the data values, which will be hourly temperatures given in degrees Celsius: Now you have the variable , which refers to the list of temperature values. The next step is to create a sequence of dates and times. pandas provides a very convenient function, , for this purpose: accepts the arguments that you use to specify the start or end of the range, number of periods, frequency, time zone, and more. Note: Although other options are available, pandas mostly uses the ISO 8601 date and time format by default. Now that you have the temperature values and the corresponding dates and times, you can create the DataFrame. In many cases, it’s convenient to use date-time values as the row labels: That’s it! You’ve created a DataFrame with time-series data and date-time row indices. Once you have a pandas DataFrame with time-series data, you can conveniently apply slicing to get just a part of the information: This example shows how to extract the temperatures between 05:00 and 14:00 (5 a.m. and 2 p.m.). Although you’ve provided strings, pandas knows that your row labels are date-time values and interprets the strings as dates and times. You’ve just seen how to combine date-time row labels and use slicing to get the information you need from the time-series data. This is just the beginning. It gets better! If you want to split a day into four six-hour intervals and get the mean temperature for each interval, then you’re just one statement away from doing so. pandas provides the method , which you can combine with other methods such as : You now have a new pandas DataFrame with four rows. Each row corresponds to a single six-hour interval. For example, the value is the mean of the first six temperatures from the DataFrame , whereas is the mean of the last six temperatures. Instead of , you can apply or to get the minimum and maximum temperatures for each interval. You can also use to get the sums of data values, although this information probably isn’t useful when you’re working with temperatures. You might also need to do some rolling-window analysis. This involves calculating a statistic for a specified number of adjacent rows, which make up your window of data. You can “roll” the window by selecting a different set of adjacent rows to perform your calculations on. Your first window starts with the first row in your DataFrame and includes as many adjacent rows as you specify. You then move your window down one row, dropping the first row and adding the row that comes immediately after the last row, and calculate the same statistic again. You repeat this process until you reach the last row of the DataFrame. pandas provides the method for this purpose: Now you have a DataFrame with mean temperatures calculated for several three-hour windows. The parameter specifies the size of the moving time window. In the example above, the third value ( ) is the mean temperature for the first three hours ( , , and ). The fourth value is the mean temperature for the hours , , and . The last value is the mean temperature for the last three hours, , , and . The first two values are missing because there isn’t enough data to calculate them.\n\npandas allows you to visualize data or create plots based on DataFrames. It uses Matplotlib in the background, so exploiting pandas’ plotting capabilities is very similar to working with Matplotlib. If you want to display the plots, then you first need to import : Now you can use to create the plot and to display it: Now returns a object that looks like this: You can also apply and get the same result. Both and have many optional parameters that you can use to specify the look of your plot. Some of them are passed directly to the underlying Matplotlib methods. You can save your figure by chaining the methods and : This statement creates the plot and saves it as a file called in your working directory. You can get other types of plots with a pandas DataFrame. For example, you can visualize your job candidate data from before as a histogram with : In this example, you extract the Python test score and total score data and visualize it with a histogram. The resulting plot looks like this: This is just the basic look. You can adjust details with optional parameters including , Matplotlib’s , and many others. You can find detailed explanations in the Anatomy of Matplotlib."
