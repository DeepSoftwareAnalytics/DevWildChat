        "document": "I'm creating objects with lots of properties and I'm curious about best practices for instantiating them. It seems like it's pretty bad to have really long constructors (instantiating new objects is not fun).\n\nI'm wondering if perhaps I should just set maybe three important properties in the constructor (e.g.title, author, and pages) and write individual setters for the rest. Or for consistency should I only use setters? If setting this way is the best path to follow, is there a good way in JS to mandate that those methods be called (kind of like interfaces in Java)?\n\nLastly, would passing in an object to my constructor and destructuring it total defeat the pt of a constructor?"

        "document": "A constructor enables you to provide any custom initialization that must be done before any other methods can be called on an instantiated object.\n\nIf you don't provide your own constructor, then a default constructor will be supplied for you. If your class is a base class, the default constructor is empty:\n\nIf your class is a derived class, the default constructor calls the parent constructor, passing along any arguments that were provided:\n\nThat enables code like this to work:\n\nThe class doesn't need an explicit constructor, because it doesn't need to do any custom initialization. The default constructor then takes care of initializing the parent from the argument it is given.\n\nHowever, if you provide your own constructor, and your class derives from some parent class, then you must explicitly call the parent class constructor using . For example:\n\nUsing on a class goes through the following steps:\n• (If it's a derived class) The body before the call is evaluated. This part should not access because it's not yet initialized.\n• (If it's a derived class) The call is evaluated, which initializes the parent class through the same process.\n• The body after the call (or the entire body, if it's a base class) is evaluated.\n\nWithin the body, you can access the object being created through and access the class that is called with through . Note that methods (including getters and setters) and the prototype chain are already initialized on before the is executed, so you can even access methods of the subclass from the constructor of the superclass. However, if those methods use , the will not have been fully initialized yet. This means reading public fields of the derived class will result in , while reading private fields will result in a .\n\nThe method may have a return value. While the base class may return anything from its constructor, the derived class must return an object or , or a will be thrown.\n\nIf the parent class constructor returns an object, that object will be used as the value on which class fields of the derived class will be defined. This trick is called \"return overriding\", which allows a derived class's fields (including private ones) to be defined on unrelated objects.\n\nThe follows normal method syntax, so parameter default values, rest parameters, etc. can all be used.\n\nThe constructor must be a literal name. Computed properties cannot become constructors.\n\nAsync methods, generator methods, accessors, and class fields are forbidden from being called . Private names cannot be called . Any member named must be a plain method."

        "document": "The body of a class is the part that is in curly braces . This is where you define class members, such as methods or constructor.\n\nThe body of a class is executed in strict mode even without the directive.\n\nA class element can be characterized by three aspects:\n\nTogether, they add up to 16 possible combinations. To divide the reference more logically and avoid overlapping content, the different elements are introduced in detail in different pages:\n\nNote: Private properties have the restriction that all property names declared in the same class must be unique. All other public properties do not have this restriction — you can have multiple public properties with the same name, and the last one overwrites the others. This is the same behavior as in object initializers.\n\nIn addition, there are two special class element syntaxes: and static initialization blocks, with their own references.\n\nThe method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class. There can only be one special method with the name \"constructor\" in a class — a is thrown if the class contains more than one occurrence of a method.\n\nA constructor can use the keyword to call the constructor of the super class.\n\nYou can create instance properties inside the constructor:\n\nAlternatively, if your instance properties' values do not depend on the constructor's arguments, you can define them as class fields.\n\nStatic initialization blocks allow flexible initialization of static properties, including the evaluation of statements during initialization, while granting access to the private scope.\n\nMultiple static blocks can be declared, and these can be interleaved with the declaration of static fields and methods (all static items are evaluated in declaration order).\n\nMethods are defined on the prototype of each class instance and are shared by all instances. Methods can be plain functions, async functions, generator functions, or async generator functions. For more information, see method definitions.\n\nThe keyword defines a static method or field for a class. Static properties (fields and methods) are defined on the class itself instead of each instance. Static methods are often used to create utility functions for an application, whereas static fields are useful for caches, fixed-configuration, or any other data that doesn't need to be replicated across instances.\n\nWith the class field declaration syntax, the constructor example can be written as:\n\nClass fields are similar to object properties, not variables, so we don't use keywords such as to declare them. In JavaScript, private properties use a special identifier syntax, so modifier keywords like and should not be used either.\n\nAs seen above, the fields can be declared with or without a default value. Fields without default values default to . By declaring fields up-front, class definitions become more self-documenting, and the fields are always present, which help with optimizations.\n\nSee public class fields for more information.\n\nUsing private fields, the definition can be refined as below.\n\nIt's an error to reference private fields from outside of the class; they can only be read or written within the class body. By defining things that are not visible outside of the class, you ensure that your classes' users can't depend on internals, which may change from version to version.\n\nPrivate fields can only be declared up-front in a field declaration. They cannot be created later through assigning to them, the way that normal properties can.\n\nFor more information, see private properties."

        "document": "We might get involved in building web applications where we must fetch large data records from an API. It could be user comments, product records, or transactions from our e-commerce application. There are various ways to show the data, and one of them is pagination.\n\nWhat is Pagination, and Why Do We Need It?\n\nThe process of pagination involves breaking up the dataset’s content into some pages. This way, we avoid overwhelming both the API and the end-user interacting with our app.\n\nSo let’s get started.\n\nYou’ll need to have Node 14.0.0 or a later version on your local development machine (but it’s not required on the server).\n\nTo create a new react project, we’re going to use the command. I’ve named the app , but you can name it whatever you’d like.\n\nOur project directory should look like this:\n\nThere are files that we don’t need, we are only going to focus on App.js, feel free to delete redundant ones.\n\nAfter creating the project, let’s go to the project directory to install dependencies(replace with your project name if yours is different)\n\nNow we’ve created the project and installed the dependencies, it’s time for coding.\n\nFirst, we have our table component from ant design, which will show the fetched values from the API.\n\nLet’s fill it with some sample data to see how it works.\n\nReplace all code in App.js with the code below:\n\nSo, we imported the table component and antd style, we have 2 constants which are dataSource and columns, and we returned the table component with its props.\n\nAnd the screen:\n\nAs you can see in the image, we have pagination on our table(bottom right corner). Now let’s get into pagination.\n\nFirst, to determine our page count, we need to know how many records we are going to get from our API. Let’s say I’m running an API on local machine on port 3001, which has an endpoint on my API that returns the count of the records.\n\nAnd another endpoint that gets records by providing limit and offset query parameter:\n\n\n\nTo fetch the records after component renders, we are going to use the hook.\n\nTo store our records and record count, we will create 2 states. Then we will add props to pagination like showSizeChanger and showQuickJumper.\n\nReplace the App.js code with the code below:\n\nNow there is a problem. We get the total count, but we only requested 10 records at our effect hook. If I try to change the pages, our contents won’t change because we didn’t implement the onChange method for our pagination.\n\nLet’s solve the issue by adding the handlePaginationChange method for our pagination:\n\nBefore moving on, I didn’t use state for keeping the current page and current page size, but if wanted, you can use and props in the pagination component. For more information about pagination component click here.\n\nNote: If you get Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique “key” prop error, and if you have the id’s on records, you can use these id’s to create keys.\n\nTo solve this, replace this code:\n\nNow we can get to the second page:\n\nPage size can be changed, and we can input desired page number in the go to box.\n\nNow there are still missing parts, while fetching the data from API, we should show the loader spinner to let the end-user know the app is not ready, and on our table rows, we don’t have anything other than just plain text so we will make it more functional, and finally, we are going to add a timeout to our requests.\n\nBefore adding the loading spinner, in our effect hook, we are individually fetching the data from API, but we should end the spinner after both of them resolves, or one of them throws an error.\n\nTo solve this problem, we are going to use Promise.all() and make some modifications to our effect hook.\n\nSo the final code is:\n\nThe response JSON we got from API:\n\nYou can display many records and enhance the user experience by using pagination. We have learned how to build pagination using React and Ant design. I hope the project helped you to understand how to implement pagination or gave you some ideas for your project.\n\nIf you found this article helpful, it would mean a lot if you gave it some applause👏\n\nIf you have any questions, problems, or suggestions please feel free to leave a comment below ✏️"
