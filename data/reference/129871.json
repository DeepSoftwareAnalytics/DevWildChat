The output also shows the filename that contains the matches.\n\nDisplay Number of Lines Before or After a Search String\n\nTo add more context to grep search results, use the option.\n\nThe option displays a specified number of lines after a match. For example, the following command instructs to print 2 additional lines after the matched pattern:\n\nThe option displays lines before a match. The following command shows 2 additional lines before each pattern match.\n\nThe option displays the specified number of lines before and after the match. The following command shows 2 lines before and after the match:\n\nIt is useful to see the line numbers when finds multiple matches.

        "document": "Searching for patterns of text in files or text streams is one of the most common tasks you'll perform in your sysadmin career. This is a valuable skill that allows you to check a variety of system configurations, analyze data, troubleshoot logs, and perform many other activities.\n\nThe most common way to find text in a Linux system is using the command-line utility . This utility was originally developed for the Unix operating system in the early 1970s. Grep evolved over the years, and the most common version available today for Linux, GNU grep, has additional features such as colored output. However, its main functionality is still the same.\n\nUsing , you can quickly find text matching a regular expression in a single file, a group of files, or text coming from using the shell pipe operator.\n\nThis article covers how to use the command to find text.\n\nThe most basic way to use is searching for text in a single file. To do this, type followed by the text pattern to search for and the file name to search in. For example, to find which port the Secure Shell (SSH) daemon uses, search for in file :\n\nNotice that finds all lines that match the text pattern regardless of where the pattern is located.\n\nIn the previous example, when you searched for in the SSH configuration file, returned two lines. The line you were looking for, Port 22, and an additional line containing the search pattern. In some cases, that's exactly what you want. In other cases, could find too many entries that you're not interested in, requiring you to sort through them to find the desired information.\n\nTo avoid that, you can use regular expressions to be more specific about what you're looking for. For example, to find only lines that start with the word , you can use the regular expression operator , like this:\n\nThis time returned only the line that started with since, in the second line, the expression is in the middle.\n\nYou can also use extended regular expressions with the command-line parameter . For example, to search for a pattern that contains the word followed by numbers, use this regular expression:\n\nYou can also look for lines that end with a text pattern by using the operator. For example, to find all lines that end with in , use like this:\n\nRegular expressions are a big part of , making it powerful and flexible. However, regular expressions are a huge topic. For additional information, look at Regular expression on Wikipedia or Regular expressions 101.\n\nSimilar to finding text patterns in a single file, you can use to find text in multiple files or directories. To find text in multiple files simultaneously, specify which files to search from after the first file name, or use a shell wildcard such as for all files. For example, to search for a configuration in two files:\n\nWhen you use multiple files, shows the name of the file where it found a match before showing the matched line.\n\n[ Keep your most commonly used commands handy with the Linux commands cheat sheet. ]\n\nTo run the search recursively in multiple subdirectories, use the command line flag :\n\nThe command is fast and returns results quickly, but it may take a long time if you specify too many files or subdirectories to search.\n\nSimilar to other Unix utilities, also acts on when you pipe the output of another command into it. This is a fast and useful way to filter a command's output to match the text pattern you're looking for.\n\nFor example, if you want to check whether the package is installed in your Fedora or Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) operating system, you can pipe the output of command , which lists all installed packages, into to search for the pattern:\n\nYou can filter long command outputs with , making finding useful information easier.\n\n[ Get the guide to installing applications on Linux. ]\n\nThe command provides many options to change how it searches for patterns or displays results. So far in this article, you've seen some of them. While I can't list all options, here are some other useful examples:\n• Use option to invert the search and display lines that do not match the pattern.\n• Use option to search for entire words only instead of patterns in the middle of other words.\n• Use option for colored output, making it easier to spot the matched pattern.\n\nFor a complete list of options, consult the man pages.\n\nThe GNU grep utility is flexible and useful, helping you accomplish many tasks in your daily sysadmin activities. The more you use , the more comfortable you will become, and soon you'll notice you're relying on it all the time.\n\nFor more information about , look at some of these links:\n• How to use grep\n\nYou can also find more information about in your Linux system by using or quick, valuable examples with the tool."

Its name is derived from the ed (editor) command g/re/p (globally search for a regular expression and print matching lines), which reflects its core functionality. is widely used by programmers, system administrators, and users alike for its efficiency and versatility in handling text data. In this article, we will explore the various aspects of the command.\n\nThe basic syntax of the ` command is as follows:\n\n: These are command-line flags that modify the behavior of .\n\n: This is the regular expression you want to search for.\n\n: This is the name of the file(s) you want to search within. You can specify multiple files for simultaneous searching.\n\nConsider the below file as an input.\n\nPratical Example of grep Command in Linux\n\nThe -i option enables to search for a string case insensitively in the given file. It matches the words like “UNIX”, “Unix”, “unix”.\n\n2. Displaying the Count of Number of Matches Using grep\n\nWe can find the number of lines that matches the given string/pattern\n\n3. Display the File Names that Matches the Pattern Using grep\n\nWe can just display the files that contains the given string/pattern.\n\n4. Checking for the Whole Words in a File Using grep\n\nBy default, grep matches the given string/pattern even if it is found as a substring in a file. The -w option to grep makes it match only the whole words.\n\n5. Displaying only the matched pattern Using grep\n\nBy default, grep displays the entire line which has the matched string. We can make the grep to display only the matched string by using the -o option.\n\n6. Show Line Number While Displaying the Output Using grep -n\n\nTo show the line number of file with the line matched.\n\nYou can display the lines that are not matched with the specified search string pattern using the -v option.\n\n8. Matching the Lines that Start with a String Using grep\n\nThe ^ regular expression pattern specifies the start of a line. This can be used in grep to match the lines which start with the given string or pattern.\n\n9. Matching the Lines that End with a String Using grep\n\nThe $ regular expression pattern specifies the end of a line. This can be used in grep to match the lines which end with the given string or pattern.\n\n11. -f file option Takes patterns from file, one per line\n\n-A prints the searched line and n lines after the result, -B prints the searched line and n lines before the result, and -C prints the searched line and n lines after and before the result.\n\n13. Search Recursively for a Pattern in the irectory\n\n-R prints the searched pattern in the given directory recursively in all the files.\n\nIn this article we discussed the command in Linux which is a powerful text-search tool that uses regular expressions to find patterns or text within files. It offers various options like case insensitivity, counting matches, and listing file names. With the ability to search recursively, use regular expression flags, and customize output, is a vital tool for Linux users to efficiently handle text-related tasks.

This means that you can use to check whether the input it receives matches a specified pattern. This seemingly trivial program is extremely powerful; its ability to sort input based on complex rules makes it a popular link in many command chains.\n\nIn this tutorial, you will explore the command’s options, and then you’ll dive into using regular expressions to do more advanced searching.\n\nTo follow along with this guide, you will need access to a computer running a Linux-based operating system. This can either be a virtual private server which you’ve connected to with SSH or your local machine. Note that this tutorial was validated using a Linux server running Ubuntu 20.04, but the examples given should work on a computer running any version of any Linux distribution.\n\nIf you plan to use a remote server to follow this guide, we encourage you to first complete our Initial Server Setup guide. Doing so will set you up with a secure server environment — including a non-root user with privileges and a firewall configured with UFW — which you can use to build your Linux skills.\n\nIn this tutorial, you’ll use to search the GNU General Public License version 3 for various words and phrases.\n\nIf you’re on an Ubuntu system, you can find the file in the folder. Copy it to your home directory:\n\nIf you’re on another system, use the command to download a copy:\n\nYou’ll also use the BSD license file in this tutorial. On Linux, you can copy that to your home directory with the following command:\n\nIf you’re on another system, create the file with the following command:\n\nNow that you have the files, you can start working with .\n\nIn the most basic form, you use to match literal patterns within a text file. This means that if you pass a word to search for, it will print out every line in the file containing that word.\n\nExecute the following command to use to search for every line that contains the word :\n\nThe first argument, , is the pattern you’re searching for, while the second argument, , is the input file you wish to search.\n\nThe resulting output will be every line containing the pattern text:\n\nOn some systems, the pattern you searched for will be highlighted in the output.\n\nBy default, will search for the exact specified pattern within the input file and return the lines it finds. You can make this behavior more useful though by adding some optional flags to .\n\nIf you want to ignore the “case” of your search parameter and search for both upper- and lower-case variations, you can specify the or option.\n\nSearch for each instance of the word (with upper, lower, or mixed cases) in the same file as before with the following command:\n\nThe results contain: , , and :\n\nIf there was an instance with , that would have been returned as well.\n\nIf you want to find all lines that do not contain a specified pattern, you can use the or option.\n\nSearch for every line that does not contain the word in the BSD license with the following command:\n\nSince you did not specify the “ignore case” option, the last two items were returned as not having the word .\n\nIt is often useful to know the line number that the matches occur on. You can do this by using the or option. Re-run the previous example with this flag added:\n\nThis will return the following text:\n\nNow you can reference the line number if you want to make changes to every line that does not contain . This is especially handy when working with source code.\n\nIn the introduction, you learned that stands for “global regular expression print”. A “regular expression” is a text string that describes a particular search pattern.\n\nDifferent applications and programming languages implement regular expressions slightly differently. In this tutorial you will only be exploring a small subset of the way that describes its patterns.\n\nIn the previous examples in this tutorial, when you searched for the words and , you were actually searching for basic regular expressions which matched the exact string of characters and . Patterns that exactly specify the characters to be matched are called “literals” because they match the pattern literally, character-for-character.\n\nIt is helpful to think of these as matching a string of characters rather than matching a word. This will become a more important distinction as you learn more complex patterns.\n\nAll alphabetical and numerical characters (as well as certain other characters) are matched literally unless modified by other expression mechanisms.\n\nAnchors are special characters that specify where in the line a match must occur to be valid.\n\nFor instance, using anchors, you can specify that you only want to know about the lines that match at the very beginning of the line. To do this, you could use the anchor before the literal string.\n\nRun the following command to search the file and find lines where occurs at the very beginning of a line:\n\nThis command will return the following two lines:\n\nSimilarly, you use the anchor at the end of a pattern to indicate that the match will only be valid if it occurs at the very end of a line.\n\nThis command will match every line ending with the word in the file:\n\nThe period character (.) is used in regular expressions to mean that any single character can exist at the specified location.\n\nFor example, to match anything in the file that has two characters and then the string , you would use the following pattern:\n\nThis command returns the following output:\n\nThis output has instances of both and and variations of the two words. The pattern would also have matched if that was found as well.\n\nBy placing a group of characters within brackets ( and ), you can specify that the character at that position can be any one character found within the bracket group.\n\nFor example, to find the lines that contain or , you would specify those variations succinctly by using the following pattern:\n\nThe output shows that both variations exist in the file:\n\nBracket notation gives you some interesting options. You can have the pattern match anything except the characters within a bracket by beginning the list of characters within the brackets with a character.\n\nThis example is like the pattern , but will not match the pattern :\n\nNotice that in the second line returned, there is, in fact, the word . This is not a failure of the regular expression or grep. Rather, this line was returned because earlier in the line, the pattern , found within the word , was found. The line was returned because there was an instance that matched the pattern.\n\nAnother helpful feature of brackets is that you can specify a range of characters instead of individually typing every available character.\n\nThis means that if you want to find every line that begins with a capital letter, you can use the following pattern:\n\nDue to some legacy sorting issues, it is often more accurate to use POSIX character classes instead of character ranges like you just used.\n\nTo discuss every POSIX character class would be beyond the scope of this guide, but an example that would accomplish the same procedure as the previous example uses the character class within a bracket selector:\n\nThe output will be the same as before.\n\nRepeat Pattern Zero or More Times\n\nFinally, one of the most commonly used meta-characters is the asterisk, or , which means “repeat the previous character or expression zero or more times”.\n\nTo find each line in the file that contains an opening and closing parenthesis, with only letters and single spaces in between, use the following expression:\n\nYou’ll get the following output:\n\nSo far you’ve used periods, asterisks, and other characters in your expressions, but sometimes you need to search for those characters specifically.\n\nThere are times where you’ll need to search for a literal period or a literal opening bracket, especially when working with source code or configuration files. Because these characters have special meaning in regular expressions, you need to “escape” these characters to tell that you do not wish to use their special meaning in this case.\n\nYou escape characters by using the backslash character ( ) in front of the character that would normally have a special meaning.\n\nFor instance, to find any line that begins with a capital letter and ends with a period, use the following expression which escapes the ending period so that it represents a literal period instead of the usual “any character” meaning:\n\nThis is the output you’ll see:\n\nNow let’s look at other regular expression options.\n\nThe command supports a more extensive regular expression language by using the flag or by calling the command instead of .\n\nThese options open up the capabilities of “extended regular expressions”. Extended regular expressions include all of the basic meta-characters, along with additional meta-characters to express more complex matches.\n\nOne of the most useful abilities that extended regular expressions open up is the ability to group expressions together to manipulate or reference as one unit.\n\nTo group expressions together, wrap them in parentheses. If you would like to use parentheses without using extended regular expressions, you can escape them with the backslash to enable this functionality. This means that the following three expressions are functionally equivalent:\n\nSimilar to how bracket expressions can specify different possible choices for single character matches, alternation allows you to specify alternative matches for strings or expression sets.\n\nTo indicate alternation, use the pipe character . These are often used within parenthetical grouping to specify that one of two or more possibilities should be considered a match.\n\nThe following will find either or in the text:\n\nThe output looks like this:\n\nAlternation can select between more than two choices by adding additional choices within the selection group separated by additional pipe ( ) characters.\n\nLike the meta-character that matched the previous character or character set zero or more times, there are other meta-characters available in extended regular expressions that specify the number of occurrences.\n\nTo match a character zero or one times, you can use the character. This makes character or character sets that came before optional, in essence.\n\nThe following matches and by putting in an optional group:\n\nThe character matches an expression one or more times. This is almost like the meta-character, but with the character, the expression must match at least once.\n\nThe following expression matches the string plus one or more characters that are not white space characters:\n\nTo specify the number of times that a match is repeated, use the brace characters ( and ). These characters let you specify an exact number, a range, or an upper or lower bounds to the amount of times an expression can match.\n\nUse the following expression to find all of the lines in the file that contain triple-vowels:\n\nEach line returned has a word with three vowels:\n\nTo match any words that have between 16 and 20 characters, use the following expression:\n\nOnly lines containing words within that length are displayed.\n\nis useful in finding patterns within files or within the file system hierarchy, so it’s worth spending time getting comfortable with its options and syntax.\n\nRegular expressions are even more versatile, and can be used with many popular programs. For instance, many text editors implement regular expressions for searching and replacing text.\n\nFurthermore, most modern programming languages use regular expressions to perform procedures on specific pieces of data. Once you understand regular expressions, you’ll be able to transfer that knowledge to many common computer-related tasks, from performing advanced searches in your text editor to validating user input."

To search for the word in all files in the current directory, append to the command:\n\nThis option ensures that only lines containing the exact word are printed, along with the names of the files in which they are found.\n\nIn this example, the output does not include lines containing the plural form .\n\nTo recursively search all files, including subdirectories, add the operator to the command:\n\nThe system prints matches for all files in the current directory and subdirectories, including the exact path with the filename. Use this option carefully, as searching for a common word across multiple directories can take time.\n\nThe option enables you to follow symbolic links within directories and extend the search to linked files and directories.\n\nThe command prints entire lines when it finds a match in a file. Add the option to print lines that completely match the search string:\n\nThe output displays lines that exactly match the search pattern only. If there are any other words or characters in the same line, does not include them in the search results.\n\nThe image shows grep results without and with the operator:\n\nTo retrieve the names of the files that contain a word or string of characters and exclude the actual lines, use the operator:\n\nThe output shows the filenames that contain but does not print the corresponding lines.\n\ndoes not search subdirectories it encounters but may display warnings such as grep: temp: is a directory. Combine the recursive search operator with to include all subdirectories in your search.\n\ncan count how many lines contain a pattern in one or more files. Use the operator to count the number of matching lines:\n\nThe command displays the number of lines that contain the pattern for each file in the current directory.\n\nShow Only the Matched Part of the Line\n\nUse the option to show only part of the line that matches the search pattern rather than the entire line:\n\nThis command displays only the parts of example_file2.txt that match the pattern.\n\nUse the command with the option to search for a string in a binary file:\n\nThe option instructs to treat the binary file as text.\n\nIndividual files, such as log files, can contain many matches for search patterns. Limit the number of lines in the grep output by adding the option and a number to the command:\n\nIn this example, the terminal prints the first three matches it finds in the example_file2.txt file.\n\nIf you do not specify a file and search all files in a directory using the asterisk ( ), the output prints the number of results specified in the command from every file. The output also shows the filename that contains the matches.\n\nDisplay Number of Lines Before or After a Search String\n\nTo add more context to grep search results, use the option.\n\nThe option displays a specified number of lines after a match. For example, the following command instructs to print 2 additional lines after the matched pattern:\n\nThe option displays lines before a match. The following command shows 2 additional lines before each pattern match.\n\nThe option displays the specified number of lines before and after the match. The following command shows 2 lines before and after the match:\n\nIt is useful to see the line numbers when finds multiple matches. Append the option to any command to show the line numbers.\n\nUse the following command to show two lines before and after each match, along with their line numbers:\n\nThe command example combines for line numbers with to display two lines before and after each match for the pattern in example_file1.txt.\n\nUse the option to search for multiple patterns in a single grep command:\n\nAlternatively, use (equivalent to the older egrep command) for a similar effect with extended regular expressions:\n\nIn this example, searches for lines that match , , and in example_file2.txt.\n\nUse of Regular Expressions in Searches\n\nUsers can append regular expressions to the command to perform complex pattern matching. The following command searches example_file1.txt for lines that start with any letter:\n\nRegular expressions like these are useful for filtering out empty lines or lines beginning with special characters or numbers.\n\ncan be combined with other commands through piping ( ) for more complex searches or data processing.\n\nIn this example, the cat command is used to display the content of example_file2.txt and pipes it into to filter lines that contain the search pattern:\n\nPiping enables you to perform advanced search operations and interact with other command-line utilities.\n\nAfter going through all the commands and examples, you know how to use to search text files from the Linux terminal.\n\nThe command has many more useful options and can be combined with the find command to search thousands of files at a time."

Its name is derived from the ed (editor) command g/re/p (globally search for a regular expression and print matching lines), which reflects its core functionality. is widely used by programmers, system administrators, and users alike for its efficiency and versatility in handling text data. In this article, we will explore the various aspects of the command.\n\nThe basic syntax of the ` command is as follows:\n\n: These are command-line flags that modify the behavior of .\n\n: This is the regular expression you want to search for.\n\n: This is the name of the file(s) you want to search within. You can specify multiple files for simultaneous searching.\n\nConsider the below file as an input.\n\nPratical Example of grep Command in Linux\n\nThe -i option enables to search for a string case insensitively in the given file. It matches the words like “UNIX”, “Unix”, “unix”.\n\n2. Displaying the Count of Number of Matches Using grep\n\nWe can find the number of lines that matches the given string/pattern\n\n3. Display the File Names that Matches the Pattern Using grep\n\nWe can just display the files that contains the given string/pattern.\n\n4. Checking for the Whole Words in a File Using grep\n\nBy default, grep matches the given string/pattern even if it is found as a substring in a file. The -w option to grep makes it match only the whole words.\n\n5. Displaying only the matched pattern Using grep\n\nBy default, grep displays the entire line which has the matched string. We can make the grep to display only the matched string by using the -o option.\n\n6. Show Line Number While Displaying the Output Using grep -n\n\nTo show the line number of file with the line matched.\n\nYou can display the lines that are not matched with the specified search string pattern using the -v option.\n\n8. Matching the Lines that Start with a String Using grep\n\nThe ^ regular expression pattern specifies the start of a line. This can be used in grep to match the lines which start with the given string or pattern.\n\n9. Matching the Lines that End with a String Using grep\n\nThe $ regular expression pattern specifies the end of a line. This can be used in grep to match the lines which end with the given string or pattern.\n\n11. -f file option Takes patterns from file, one per line\n\n-A prints the searched line and n lines after the result, -B prints the searched line and n lines before the result, and -C prints the searched line and n lines after and before the result.\n\n13. Search Recursively for a Pattern in the irectory\n\n-R prints the searched pattern in the given directory recursively in all the files.\n\nIn this article we discussed the command in Linux which is a powerful text-search tool that uses regular expressions to find patterns or text within files. It offers various options like case insensitivity, counting matches, and listing file names. With the ability to search recursively, use regular expression flags, and customize output, is a vital tool for Linux users to efficiently handle text-related tasks.

        "document": "Grep, short for “global regular expression print”, is a command used for searching and matching text patterns in files contained in the regular expressions. Furthermore, the command comes pre-installed in every Linux distribution. In this guide, we will look at the most common command use-cases.\n\nGrep command can be used to find or search a regular expression or a string in a text file. To demonstrate this, let’s create a text file welcome.txt and add some content as shown.\n\nGreat! Now we are ready to perform a few grep commands and manipulate the output to get the desired results. To search for a string in a file, run the command below Syntax\n\nOutput As you can see, grep has not only searched and matched the string “Linux” but has also printed the lines in which the string appears. If the file is located in a different file path, be sure to specify the file path as shown below\n\nIf you are working on a system that doesn’t display the search string or pattern in a different color from the rest of the text, use the to make your results stand out. Example\n\nSearching for a string recursively in all directories\n\nIf you wish to search for a string in your current directory and all other subdirectories, search using the flag as shown\n\nIn the above example, our search results gave us what we wanted because the string “Linux” was specified in Uppercase and also exists in the file in Uppercase. Now let’s try and search for the string in lowercase.\n\nNothing from the output, right? This is because grepping could not find and match the string “linux” since the first letter is Lowercase. To ignore case sensitivity, use the flag and execute the command below\n\nOutput Awesome isn’t’ it? The is normally used to display strings regardless of their case sensitivity.\n\nCount the lines where strings are matched with -c option\n\nTo count the total number of lines where the string pattern appears or resides, execute the command below\n\nTo invert the Grep output , use the flag. The option instructs grep to print all lines that do not contain or match the expression. The –v option tells grep to invert its output, meaning that instead of printing matching lines, do the opposite and print all of the lines that don’t match the expression. Going back to our file, let us display the line numbers as shown. Hit ESC on Vim editor, type a full colon followed by\n\nNext, press Enter Output Now, to display the lines that don’t contain the string “Linux” run\n\nOutput As you can see, grep has displayed the lines that do not contain the search pattern.\n\nNumber the lines that contain the search pattern with -n option\n\nTo number the lines where the string pattern is matched , use the option as shown\n\nSearch for exact matching word using the -w option\n\nPassing then flag will search for the line containing the exact matching word as shown\n\nOutput However, if you try\n\nNo, results will be returned because we are not searching for a pattern but an exact word!\n\nThe grep command can be used together with pipes for getting distinct output. For example, If you want to know if a certain package is installed in Ubuntu system execute\n\nFor example, to find out if OpenSSH has been installed in your system pipe the command to grep as shown\n\nDisplaying number of lines before or after a search pattern Using pipes\n\nYou can use the -A or -B to dislay number of lines that either precede or come after the search string. The -A flag denotes the lines that come after the search string and -B prints the output that appears before the search string. For example\n\nThis command displays the line containing the string plus 4 lines of text after the ens string in the command. Output Conversely, in the example below, the use of the -B flag will display the line containing the search string plus 3 lines of text before the ether string in the command. Output\n\nThe term REGEX is an acronym for REGular EXpression. A REGEX is a sequence of characters that is used to match a pattern. Below are a few examples:\n\nExample To print lines beginning with a certain character, the syntax is;\n\nFor instance, to display the lines that begin with the letter “d” in our welcome.txt file, we would execute\n\nOutput To display lines that end with the letter ‘x’ run\n\nGetting help with more Grep options\n\nIf you need to learn more on Grep command usage, run the command below to get a sneak preview of other flags or options that you may use together with the command.\n\nSample Output We appreciate your time for going through this tutorial.
