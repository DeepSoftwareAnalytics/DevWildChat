        "document": "Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression and outliers detection.\n\nThe advantages of support vector machines are:\n• None Still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.\n• None Uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient.\n• None Versatile: different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision function. Common kernels are provided, but it is also possible to specify custom kernels.\n• None If the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, avoid over-fitting in choosing Kernel functions and regularization term is crucial.\n• None SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an expensive five-fold cross-validation (see Scores and probabilities, below).\n\nThe support vector machines in scikit-learn support both dense ( and convertible to that by ) and sparse (any ) sample vectors as input. However, to use an SVM to make predictions for sparse data, it must have been fit on such data. For optimal performance, use C-ordered (dense) or (sparse) with .\n\nThe method of Support Vector Classification can be extended to solve regression problems. This method is called Support Vector Regression. The model produced by support vector classification (as described above) depends only on a subset of the training data, because the cost function for building the model does not care about training points that lie beyond the margin. Analogously, the model produced by Support Vector Regression depends only on a subset of the training data, because the cost function ignores samples whose prediction is close to their target. There are three different implementations of Support Vector Regression: , and . provides a faster implementation than but only considers the linear kernel, while implements a slightly different formulation than and . Due to its implementation in also regularizes the intercept, if considered. This effect can however be reduced by carefully fine tuning its parameter, which allows the intercept term to have a different regularization behavior compared to the other features. The classification results and score can therefore differ from the other two classifiers. See Implementation details for further details. As with classification classes, the fit method will take as argument vectors X, y, only that in this case y is expected to have floating point values instead of integer values:\n• None Avoiding data copy: For , , and , if the data passed to certain methods is not C-ordered contiguous and double precision, it will be copied before calling the underlying C implementation. You can check whether a given numpy array is C-contiguous by inspecting its attribute. For (and ) any input passed as a numpy array will be copied and converted to the liblinear internal sparse data representation (double precision floats and int32 indices of non-zero components). If you want to fit a large-scale linear classifier without copying a dense numpy C-contiguous double precision array as input, we suggest to use the class instead. The objective function can be configured to be almost the same as the model.\n• None Kernel cache size: For , , and , the size of the kernel cache has a strong impact on run times for larger problems. If you have enough RAM available, it is recommended to set to a higher value than the default of 200(MB), such as 500(MB) or 1000(MB).\n• None Setting C: is by default and it’s a reasonable default choice. If you have a lot of noisy observations you should decrease it: decreasing C corresponds to more regularization. and are less sensitive to when it becomes large, and prediction results stop improving after a certain threshold. Meanwhile, larger values will take more time to train, sometimes up to 10 times longer, as shown in .\n• None Support Vector Machine algorithms are not scale invariant, so it is highly recommended to scale your data. For example, scale each attribute on the input vector X to [0,1] or [-1,+1], or standardize it to have mean 0 and variance 1. Note that the same scaling must be applied to the test vector to obtain meaningful results. This can be done easily by using a : See section Preprocessing data for more details on scaling and normalization.\n• None Regarding the parameter, quoting : We found that if the number of iterations is large, then shrinking can shorten the training time. However, if we loosely solve the optimization problem (e.g., by using a large stopping tolerance), the code without using shrinking may be much faster\n• None Parameter in / / approximates the fraction of training errors and support vectors.\n• None In , if the data is unbalanced (e.g. many positive and few negative), set and/or try different penalty parameters .\n• None Randomness of the underlying implementations: The underlying implementations of and use a random number generator only to shuffle the data for probability estimation (when is set to ). This randomness can be controlled with the parameter. If is set to these estimators are not random and has no effect on the results. The underlying implementation is similar to the ones of and . As no probability estimation is provided for , it is not random. The underlying implementation uses a random number generator to select features when fitting the model with a dual coordinate descent (i.e. when is set to ). It is thus not uncommon to have slightly different results for the same input data. If that happens, try with a smaller parameter. This randomness can also be controlled with the parameter. When is set to the underlying implementation of is not random and has no effect on the results.\n• None Using L1 penalization as provided by yields a sparse solution, i.e. only a subset of feature weights is different from zero and contribute to the decision function. Increasing yields a more complex model (more features are selected). The value that yields a “null” model (all weights equal to zero) can be calculated using .\n\nThe kernel function can be any of the following:\n• None polynomial: \\((\\gamma \\langle x, x'\\rangle + r)^d\\), where \\(d\\) is specified by parameter , \\(r\\) by .\n• None rbf: \\(\\exp(-\\gamma \\|x-x'\\|^2)\\), where \\(\\gamma\\) is specified by parameter , must be greater than 0.\n• None sigmoid \\(\\tanh(\\gamma \\langle x,x'\\rangle + r)\\), where \\(r\\) is specified by . Different kernels are specified by the parameter: See also Kernel Approximation for a solution to use RBF kernels that is much faster and more scalable. When training an SVM with the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, two parameters must be considered: and . The parameter , common to all SVM kernels, trades off misclassification of training examples against simplicity of the decision surface. A low makes the decision surface smooth, while a high aims at classifying all training examples correctly. defines how much influence a single training example has. The larger is, the closer other examples must be to be affected. Proper choice of and is critical to the SVM’s performance. One is advised to use with and spaced exponentially far apart to choose good values. You can define your own kernels by either giving the kernel as a python function or by precomputing the Gram matrix. Classifiers with custom kernels behave the same way as any other classifiers, except that:\n• None Field is now empty, only indices of support vectors are stored in\n• None A reference (and not a copy) of the first argument in the method is stored for future reference. If that array changes between the use of and you will have unexpected results. You can use your own defined kernels by passing a function to the parameter. Your kernel must take as arguments two matrices of shape , and return a kernel matrix of shape . The following code defines a linear kernel and creates a classifier instance that will use that kernel: You can pass pre-computed kernels by using the option. You should then pass Gram matrix instead of X to the and methods. The kernel values between all training vectors and the test vectors must be provided:\n\nA support vector machine constructs a hyper-plane or set of hyper-planes in a high or infinite dimensional space, which can be used for classification, regression or other tasks. Intuitively, a good separation is achieved by the hyper-plane that has the largest distance to the nearest training data points of any class (so-called functional margin), since in general the larger the margin the lower the generalization error of the classifier. The figure below shows the decision function for a linearly separable problem, with three samples on the margin boundaries, called “support vectors”: In general, when the problem isn’t linearly separable, the support vectors are the samples within the margin boundaries. We recommend and as good references for the theory and practicalities of SVMs. Given training vectors \\(x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^p\\), i=1,…, n, in two classes, and a vector \\(y \\in \\{1, -1\\}^n\\), our goal is to find \\(w \\in \\mathbb{R}^p\\) and \\(b \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) such that the prediction given by \\(\\text{sign} (w^T\\phi(x) + b)\\) is correct for most samples. Intuitively, we’re trying to maximize the margin (by minimizing \\(||w||^2 = w^Tw\\)), while incurring a penalty when a sample is misclassified or within the margin boundary. Ideally, the value \\(y_i (w^T \\phi (x_i) + b)\\) would be \\(\\geq 1\\) for all samples, which indicates a perfect prediction. But problems are usually not always perfectly separable with a hyperplane, so we allow some samples to be at a distance \\(\\zeta_i\\) from their correct margin boundary. The penalty term controls the strength of this penalty, and as a result, acts as an inverse regularization parameter (see note below). The dual problem to the primal is \\[ \\begin{align}\\begin{aligned}\\min_{\\alpha} \\frac{1}{2} \\alpha^T Q \\alpha - e^T \\alpha\\\\\\begin{split} \\textrm {subject to } & y^T \\alpha = 0\\\\ & 0 \\leq \\alpha_i \\leq C, i=1, ..., n\\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\end{align} \\] where \\(e\\) is the vector of all ones, and \\(Q\\) is an \\(n\\) by \\(n\\) positive semidefinite matrix, \\(Q_{ij} \\equiv y_i y_j K(x_i, x_j)\\), where \\(K(x_i, x_j) = \\phi (x_i)^T \\phi (x_j)\\) is the kernel. The terms \\(\\alpha_i\\) are called the dual coefficients, and they are upper-bounded by \\(C\\). This dual representation highlights the fact that training vectors are implicitly mapped into a higher (maybe infinite) dimensional space by the function \\(\\phi\\): see kernel trick. Once the optimization problem is solved, the output of decision_function for a given sample \\(x\\) becomes: and the predicted class correspond to its sign. We only need to sum over the support vectors (i.e. the samples that lie within the margin) because the dual coefficients \\(\\alpha_i\\) are zero for the other samples. These parameters can be accessed through the attributes which holds the product \\(y_i \\alpha_i\\), which holds the support vectors, and which holds the independent term \\(b\\) While SVM models derived from libsvm and liblinear use as regularization parameter, most other estimators use . The exact equivalence between the amount of regularization of two models depends on the exact objective function optimized by the model. For example, when the estimator used is regression, the relation between them is given as \\(C = \\frac{1}{alpha}\\). The primal problem can be equivalently formulated as where we make use of the hinge loss. This is the form that is directly optimized by , but unlike the dual form, this one does not involve inner products between samples, so the famous kernel trick cannot be applied. This is why only the linear kernel is supported by (\\(\\phi\\) is the identity function). The \\(\n\nu\\)-SVC formulation is a reparameterization of the \\(C\\)-SVC and therefore mathematically equivalent. We introduce a new parameter \\(\n\nu\\) (instead of \\(C\\)) which controls the number of support vectors and margin errors: \\(\n\nu \\in (0, 1]\\) is an upper bound on the fraction of margin errors and a lower bound of the fraction of support vectors. A margin error corresponds to a sample that lies on the wrong side of its margin boundary: it is either misclassified, or it is correctly classified but does not lie beyond the margin. Given training vectors \\(x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^p\\), i=1,…, n, and a vector \\(y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) \\(\\varepsilon\\)-SVR solves the following primal problem: Here, we are penalizing samples whose prediction is at least \\(\\varepsilon\\) away from their true target. These samples penalize the objective by \\(\\zeta_i\\) or \\(\\zeta_i^*\\), depending on whether their predictions lie above or below the \\(\\varepsilon\\) tube. \\[ \\begin{align}\\begin{aligned}\\min_{\\alpha, \\alpha^*} \\frac{1}{2} (\\alpha - \\alpha^*)^T Q (\\alpha - \\alpha^*) + \\varepsilon e^T (\\alpha + \\alpha^*) - y^T (\\alpha - \\alpha^*)\\\\\\begin{split} \\textrm {subject to } & e^T (\\alpha - \\alpha^*) = 0\\\\ & 0 \\leq \\alpha_i, \\alpha_i^* \\leq C, i=1, ..., n\\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\end{align} \\] where \\(e\\) is the vector of all ones, \\(Q\\) is an \\(n\\) by \\(n\\) positive semidefinite matrix, \\(Q_{ij} \\equiv K(x_i, x_j) = \\phi (x_i)^T \\phi (x_j)\\) is the kernel. Here training vectors are implicitly mapped into a higher (maybe infinite) dimensional space by the function \\(\\phi\\). These parameters can be accessed through the attributes which holds the difference \\(\\alpha_i - \\alpha_i^*\\), which holds the support vectors, and which holds the independent term \\(b\\) The primal problem can be equivalently formulated as where we make use of the epsilon-insensitive loss, i.e. errors of less than \\(\\varepsilon\\) are ignored. This is the form that is directly optimized by ."

        "document": "With from scikit-learn, you can efficiently divide your dataset into training and testing subsets to ensure unbiased model evaluation in machine learning. This process helps prevent overfitting and underfitting by keeping the test data separate from the training data, allowing you to assess the model’s predictive performance accurately.\n\nBy the end of this tutorial, you’ll understand that:\n• is a function in that divides datasets into training and testing subsets.\n• and represent the inputs and outputs of the training data subset, respectively, while and represent the input and output of the testing data subset.\n• By specifying , you use 20% of the dataset for testing, leaving 80% for training.\n• can handle imbalanced datasets using the parameter to maintain class distribution.\n\nYou’ll learn how to use and apply these concepts in real-world scenarios, ensuring your machine learning models are evaluated with precision and fairness. In addition, you’ll explore related tools from for further insights.\n\nNow that you understand the need to split a dataset in order to perform unbiased model evaluation and identify underfitting or overfitting, you’re ready to learn how to split your own datasets. You’ll use version 1.5.0 of scikit-learn, or . It has many packages for data science and machine learning, but for this tutorial, you’ll focus on the package, specifically on the function . Note: While this tutorial is tested with this specific version of scikit-learn, the features that you’ll use are core to the library and should work equivalently in other versions of scikit-learn as well. You can install with : If you use Anaconda, then you probably already have it installed. However, if you want to use a fresh environment, ensure that you have the specified version or use Miniconda. Then you can install from Anaconda Cloud with : You’ll also need NumPy, but you don’t have to install it separately. You should get it along with if you don’t already have it installed. If you want to, you can refresh your NumPy knowledge and check out NumPy Tutorial: Your First Steps Into Data Science in Python.\n\nYou need to import and NumPy before you can use them. You can work in a Jupyter notebook or start a new Python REPL session, then you can start with the statements: Now that you have both imported, you can use them to split data into training sets and test sets. You’ll split inputs and outputs at the same time, with a single function call. With , you only need to provide the arrays that you want to split. Additionally, you can also provide some optional arguments. The function usually returns a list of NumPy arrays but can also return a couple of other iterable types, such as SciPy sparse matrices, if appropriate: The parameter in the function signature of refers to the sequence of lists, NumPy arrays, pandas DataFrames, or similar array-like objects that hold the data that you want to split. All these objects together make up the dataset and must be of the same length. In supervised machine learning applications, you’ll typically work with two such arrays: The parameter indicates that you can customize the function’s behavior with optional keyword arguments:\n• is the number that defines the size of the training set. If you provide a , then it must be between and and it will define the share of the dataset used for testing. If you provide an , then it will represent the total number of the training samples. The default value is .\n• is the number that defines the size of the test set. It’s very similar to . You should provide either or . If neither is given, then the default share of the dataset that will be used for testing is , or 25 percent.\n• is the object that controls randomization during splitting. It can be either an or an instance of . Setting the random state is useful if you need reproducibility. The default value is .\n• is the Boolean object that determines whether to shuffle the dataset before applying the split. The default value is .\n• is an array-like object that, if not , determines how to use a stratified split. Now it’s time to try data splitting! You’ll start by creating a simple dataset to work with. The dataset will contain the inputs in the two-dimensional array and outputs in the one-dimensional array : To get your data, you use , which is very convenient for generating arrays based on numerical ranges. You also use to modify the shape of the array returned by and get a two-dimensional data structure. You can split both input and output datasets with a single function call: Given two arrays, like and here, performs the split and returns four arrays (in this case NumPy arrays) in this order:\n• : The training part of the first array ( )\n• : The test part of the first array ( )\n• : The training part of the second array ( )\n• : The test part of the second array ( ) You probably got different results from what you see here. This is because dataset splitting is random by default. The result differs each time you run the function. However, this often isn’t what you want. Sometimes, to make your tests reproducible, you need a random split with the same output for each function call. You can do that with the parameter . The value of isn’t important—it can be any non-negative integer. You could use an instance of instead, but that’s a more complex approach. In the previous example, you used a dataset with twelve rows, or observations, and got a training sample with nine rows and a test sample with three rows. That’s because you didn’t specify the desired size of the training and test sets. By default, 25 percent of samples are assigned to the test set. This ratio is generally fine for many applications, but it’s not always what you need. Typically, you’ll want to define the size of the test or training set explicitly, and sometimes you’ll even want to experiment with different values. You can do that with the parameters or . Modify the code so you can choose the size of the test set and get a reproducible result: With this change, you get a different result from before. Earlier, you had a training set with nine items and a test set with three items. Now, thanks to the argument , the training set has eight items and the test set has four items. You’d get the same result with because 33 percent of twelve is approximately four. There’s one more very important difference between the last two examples: You now get the same result each time you run the function. This is because you’ve fixed the random number generator with . The figure below shows what’s going on when you call : The samples of the dataset are shuffled randomly and then split into the training and test sets according to the size you defined. You can see that has six zeros and six ones. However, the test set has three zeros out of four items. If you want to (approximately) keep the proportion of values through the training and test sets, then pass . This will enable stratified splitting: Now and have the same ratio of zeros and ones as the original array. Stratified splits are desirable in some cases, like when you’re classifying an imbalanced dataset, which is a dataset with a significant difference in the number of samples that belong to distinct classes. Finally, you can turn off data shuffling and random split with : Now you have a split in which the first two-thirds of samples in the original and arrays are assigned to the training set and the last third to the test set. No shuffling. No randomness.\n\nNow it’s time to see in action when solving supervised learning problems. You’ll start with a small regression problem that can be solved with linear regression before looking at a bigger problem. You’ll also see that you can use for classification as well. In this example, you’ll apply what you’ve learned so far to solve a small regression problem. You’ll learn how to create datasets, split them into training and test subsets, and use them for linear regression. As always, you’ll start by importing the necessary packages, functions, or classes. You’ll need NumPy, , and : Now that you’ve imported everything you need, you can create two small arrays, and , to represent the observations and then split them into training and test sets just as you did before: Your dataset has twenty observations, or - pairs. You specify the argument , so the dataset is divided into a training set with twelve observations and a test set with eight observations. Now you can use the training set to fit the model: creates the object that represents the model, while trains, or fits, the model and returns it. With linear regression, fitting the model means determining the best intercept ( ) and slope ( ) values of the regression line. Although you can use and to check the goodness of fit, this isn’t a best practice. An unbiased estimation of the predictive performance of your model is based on test data: returns the coefficient of determination, or R², for the data passed. Its maximum is . The higher the R² value, the better the fit. In this case, the training data yields a slightly higher coefficient. However, the R² calculated with test data is an unbiased measure of your model’s prediction performance. This is how it looks on a graph: The green dots represent the - pairs used for training. The black line, called the estimated regression line, is defined by the results of model fitting: the intercept and the slope. So, it reflects the positions of the green dots only. The white dots represent the test set. You use them to estimate the performance of the model (regression line) with data not used for training. Now you’re ready to split a larger dataset to solve a regression problem. You’ll use the California Housing dataset, which is included in . This dataset has 20640 samples, eight input variables, and the house values as the output. You can retrieve it with . Now that you have both functions imported, you can get the data you’ll work with: As you can see, with the argument returns a tuple with two NumPy arrays: The next step is to split the data the same way as before: Now you have the training and test sets. The training data is contained in and , while the data for testing is in and . When you work with larger datasets, it’s usually more convenient to pass the training or test size as a ratio. means that approximately 40 percent of samples will be assigned to the test data, and the remaining 60 percent will be assigned to the training data. Finally, you can use the training set ( and ) to fit the model and the test set ( and ) for an unbiased evaluation of the model. In this example, you’ll apply three well-known regression algorithms to create models that fit your data: The process is pretty much the same as with the previous example:\n• Import the classes you need.\n• Fit the model instances with using the training set.\n• Evaluate the model with using the test set. Here’s the code that follows the steps described above for all three regression algorithms: You’ve used your training and test datasets to fit three models and evaluate their performance. The measure of accuracy obtained with is the coefficient of determination. It can be calculated with either the training or test set. However, as you already learned, the score obtained with the test set represents an unbiased estimation of performance. As mentioned in the documentation, you can provide optional arguments to , , and . and use the parameter for the same reason that does: to deal with randomness in the algorithms and ensure reproducibility. For some methods, you may also need feature scaling. In such cases, you should fit the scalers with training data and use them to transform test data. You can use to solve classification problems the same way you do for regression analysis. In machine learning, classification problems involve training a model to apply labels to, or classify, the input values and sort your dataset into categories. In the tutorial Logistic Regression in Python, you’ll find an example of a handwriting recognition task. The example provides another demonstration of splitting data into training and test sets to avoid bias in the evaluation process.\n\nThe package offers a lot of functionalities related to model selection and validation, including the following: Cross-validation is a set of techniques that combine the measures of prediction performance to get more accurate model estimations. One of the widely used cross-validation methods is k-fold cross-validation. In it, you divide your dataset into k (often five or ten) subsets, or folds, of equal size and then perform the training and test procedures k times. Each time, you use a different fold as the test set and all the remaining folds as the training set. This provides k measures of predictive performance, and you can then analyze their mean and standard deviation. You can implement cross-validation with , , , and a few other classes and functions from . A learning curve, sometimes called a training curve, shows how the prediction score of training and validation sets depends on the number of training samples. You can use to get this dependency, which can help you find the optimal size of the training set, choose hyperparameters, compare models, and so on. Hyperparameter tuning, also called hyperparameter optimization, is the process of determining the best set of hyperparameters to define your machine learning model. provides you with several options for this purpose, including , , , and others. Splitting your data is also important for hyperparameter tuning."

        "document": "In this article, we will discuss how to split a dataset using scikit-learns’ train_test_split().\n\nThe train_test_split() method is used to split our data into train and test sets. First, we need to divide our data into features (X) and labels (y). The dataframe gets divided into X_train, X_test, y_train, and y_test. X_train and y_train sets are used for training and fitting the model. The X_test and y_test sets are used for testing the model if it’s predicting the right outputs/labels. we can explicitly test the size of the train and test sets. It is suggested to keep our train sets larger than the test sets.\n• Train set: The training dataset is a set of data that was utilized to fit the model. The dataset on which the model is trained. This data is seen and learned by the model.\n• Test set: The test dataset is a subset of the training dataset that is utilized to give an accurate evaluation of a final model fit.\n• validation set: A validation dataset is a sample of data from your model’s training set that is used to estimate model performance while tuning the model’s hyperparameters.\n• underfitting: A data model that is under-fitted has a high error rate on both the training set and unobserved data because it is unable to effectively represent the relationship between the input and output variables.\n• overfitting: when a statistical model matches its training data exactly but the algorithm’s goal is lost because it is unable to accurately execute against unseen data is called overfitting\n\nStep 1: Import the necessary packages or modules:\n\nIn this step, we are importing the necessary packages or modules into the working python environment.\n\nHere, we load the CSV using pd.read_csv() method from pandas and get the shape of the data set using the shape() function.\n\nHere, we are assigning the X and the Y variable in which the X feature variable has independent variables and the y feature variable has a dependent variable.\n\nStep 4: Use the train test split class to split data into train and test sets:\n\nHere, the train_test_split() class from sklearn.model_selection is used to split our data into train and test sets where feature variables are given as input in the method. test_size determines the portion of the data which will go into test sets and a random state is used for data reproducibility.\n\nIn this example, ‘predictions.csv’ file is imported. df.shape attribute is used to retrieve the shape of the data frame. The shape of the dataframe is (13,3). The features columns are taken in the X variable and the outcome column is taken in the y variable. X and y variables are passed in the train_test_split() method to split the data frame into train and test sets. The random state parameter is used for data reproducibility. test_size is given as 0.25 which means 25% of the data goes into the test sets. 4 out of 13 rows in the dataframe go into the test sets. 75% of data goes into the train sets, which is 9 rows out of 13 rows. The train sets are used to fit and train the machine learning model. The test sets are used for evaluation.\n\nIn this example the following steps are executed :\n• The necessary packages are imported.\n• Advertising.csv data set is loaded and cleaned, and null values are dropped.\n• The arrays created are split into train and test sets. 30% of the dataset goes into the test set, which means 70% data is a train set.\n• X_train is fit into the scaler.\n• X_train and X_test are transformed using the transform() method.\n• the predict() method is used to carry out predictions on the X_test set.\n• mean_squared_error() metric is used to evaluate the model.\n\nTo view and download the CSV file used in this example, click here.\n\nIn this example, we’re gonna use the K-nearest neighbors classifier model.\n\nIn this example the following steps are executed :\n• The necessary packages are imported.\n• The arrays created are split into train and test sets. 30% of the dataset goes into the test set, which means 70% data is a train set.\n• A basic Knn model is created using the KNeighborsClassifier class.\n• the predict() method is used to carry out predictions on the X_test set."

        "document": "What is a good way to split a NumPy array randomly into training and testing/validation dataset? Something similar to the cvpartition or crossvalind functions in Matlab.\n\nIf you want to split the data set once in two parts, you can use , or if you need to keep track of the indices (remember to fix the random seed to make everything reproducible): There are many ways other ways to repeatedly partition the same data set for cross validation. Many of those are available in the library (k-fold, leave-n-out, ...). also includes more advanced \"stratified sampling\" methods that create a partition of the data that is balanced with respect to some features, for example to make sure that there is the same proportion of positive and negative examples in the training and test set.\n\nThere is another option that just entails using scikit-learn. As scikit's wiki describes, you can just use the following instructions: This way you can keep in sync the labels for the data you're trying to split into training and test.\n\nJust a note. In case you want the train, test, AND validation sets, you can do this: These parameters will give 70 % to training, and 15 % each to test and val sets. Hope this helps.\n\nAfter doing some reading and taking into account the (many..) different ways of splitting the data to train and test, I decided to timeit! I used 4 different methods (non of them are using the library sklearn, which I'm sure will give the best results, giving that it is well designed and tested code):\n• shuffle the whole matrix arr and then split the data to train and test\n• shuffle the indices and then assign it x and y to split the data\n• same as method 2, but in a more efficient way to do it method 3 won by far with the shortest time, after that method 1, and method 2 and 4 discovered to be really inefficient. The code for the 4 different methods I timed: import numpy as np arr = np.random.rand(100, 3) X = arr[:,:2] Y = arr[:,2] spl = 0.7 N = len(arr) sample = int(spl*N) #%% Method 1: shuffle the whole matrix arr and then split np.random.shuffle(arr) x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = X[:sample,:], X[sample:, :], Y[:sample, ], Y[sample:,] #%% Method 2: shuffle the indecies and then shuffle and apply to X and Y train_idx = np.random.choice(N, sample) Xtrain = X[train_idx] Ytrain = Y[train_idx] test_idx = [idx for idx in range(N) if idx not in train_idx] Xtest = X[test_idx] Ytest = Y[test_idx] #%% Method 3: shuffle indicies without a for loop idx = np.random.permutation(arr.shape[0]) # can also use random.shuffle train_idx, test_idx = idx[:sample], idx[sample:] x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = X[train_idx,:], X[test_idx,:], Y[train_idx,], Y[test_idx,] #%% Method 4: using pandas dataframe to split import pandas as pd df = pd.read_csv(file_path, header=None) # Some csv file (I used some file with 3 columns) train = df.sample(frac=0.7, random_state=200) test = df.drop(train.index) And for the times, the minimum time to execute out of 3 repetitions of 1000 loops is:\n\nI wrote a function for my own project to do this (it doesn't use numpy, though): def partition(seq, chunks): \"\"\"Splits the sequence into equal sized chunks and them as a list\"\"\" result = [] for i in range(chunks): chunk = [] for element in seq[i:len(seq):chunks]: chunk.append(element) result.append(chunk) return result If you want the chunks to be randomized, just shuffle the list before passing it in.\n\nI'm aware that my solution is not the best, but it comes in handy when you want to split data in a simplistic way, especially when teaching data science to newbies! def simple_split(descriptors, targets): testX_indices = [i for i in range(descriptors.shape[0]) if i % 4 == 0] validX_indices = [i for i in range(descriptors.shape[0]) if i % 4 == 1] trainX_indices = [i for i in range(descriptors.shape[0]) if i % 4 >= 2] TrainX = descriptors[trainX_indices, :] ValidX = descriptors[validX_indices, :] TestX = descriptors[testX_indices, :] TrainY = targets[trainX_indices] ValidY = targets[validX_indices] TestY = targets[testX_indices] return TrainX, ValidX, TestX, TrainY, ValidY, TestY According to this code, data will be split into three parts - 1/4 for the test part, another 1/4 for the validation part, and 2/4 for the training set."
