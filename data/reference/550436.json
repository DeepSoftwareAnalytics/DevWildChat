The script is supposed to switch (su) to the username, cd to a specific directory based upon the project string.\n\nI basically want to do:\n\nThe problem is that once I do an su... it just waits there. Which makes sense since the flow of execution has passed to switching to the user. Once I exit, then the rest of the things execute but it doesn't work as desired.\n\nI prepended su to the svn command but the command failed (i.e. it didn't update svn in the directory desired).\n\nHow do I write a script that allows the user to switch user and invoke svn (among other things)?"
