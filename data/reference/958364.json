The idea is to:\n• None The insertion operation in a min-heap involves the following steps:\n• None Add the new element to the end of the heap, in the next available position in the last level of the tree.\n• None Compare the new element with its parent. If the parent is greater than the new element, swap them.\n• None Repeat step 2 until the parent is smaller than or equal to the new element, or until the new element reaches the root of the tree.\n• None The new element is now in its correct position in the min heap, and the heap property is satisfied.\n\n// Function to insert a new element into the min-heap // Add the new element to the end of the heap // Get the index of the last element // Compare the new element with its parent and swap if // Move up the tree to the parent of the current // Function to insert a new element into the min-heap // Add the new element to the end of the heap // Get the index of the last element // Compare the new element with its parent and swap // Move up the tree to the parent of the current // Function to swap two elements in an array # Add the new element to the end of the heap # Get the index of the last element # Compare the new element with its parent and swap if necessary # Move up the tree to the parent of the current element // Function to insert a new element into the min-heap // Add the new element to the end of the heap // Get the index of the last element // Compare the new element with its parent and swap // Move up the tree to the parent of the current\n\nTime Complexity: O(log(n)) (where n is no of elements in the heap)\n\nAuxiliary Space: O(n)\n\nRemoving the smallest element (the root) from the min heap. The root is replaced by the last element in the heap, and then the heap property is restored by swapping the new root with its smallest child until the parent is smaller than both children or until the new root reaches a leaf node.\n• None Replace the root or element to be deleted with the last element.\n• None Delete the last element from the Heap.\n• None Since the last element is now placed at the position of the root node. So, it may not follow the heap property. Therefore, heapify the last node placed at the position of the root.\n\n// Function to insert a new element into the min-heap // Add the new element to the end of the heap // Get the index of the last element // Compare the new element with its parent and swap if // Move up the tree to the parent of the current // Function to delete a node from the min-heap // Find the index of the element to be deleted // If the element is not found, return // Replace the element to be deleted with the last // Heapify the tree starting from the element at the // Main function to test the insert_min_heap and // Function to insert a new element into the min-heap // Add the new element to the end of the heap // Get the index of the last element // Compare the new element with its parent and swap // Move up the tree to the parent of the current // Function to delete a node from the min-heap // Find the index of the element to be deleted // If the element is not found, return // Replace the element to be deleted with the last // Heapify the tree starting from the element at the // Main function to test the insertMinHeap and // Add the new element to the end of the heap // Get the index of the last element // Compare the new element with its parent and swap if necessary // Move up the tree to the parent of the current element // Find the index of the element to be deleted // If the element is not found, return // Replace the element to be deleted with the last element // Heapify the tree starting from the element at the deleted index // Main function to test the insertMinHeap and deleteMinHeap functions\n\nTime complexity: O(log n) where n is no of elements in the heap\n\nAuxiliary Space: O(n)\n\nTo access the minimum element (i.e., the root of the heap), the value of the root node is returned. The time complexity of peek in a min-heap is O(1).\n\nTime complexity: In a min heap implemented using an array or a list, the peak element can be accessed in constant time, O(1), as it is always located at the root of the heap.\n\nIn a min heap implemented using a binary tree, the peak element can also be accessed in O(1) time, as it is always located at the root of the tree.\n\nA heapify operation can be used to create a min heap from an unsorted array. This is done by starting at the last non-leaf node and repeatedly performing the “bubble down” operation until all nodes satisfy the heap property.\n\n// Function to maintain the min-heap property of the heap rooted at index 'i' // Assume the root is the smallest element initially // Calculate the indices of the left and right child of the current node // Compare the left child with the current smallest // Compare the right child with the current smallest // If the current node is not the smallest, swap it with the smallest child // Recursively heapify the subtree rooted at the smallest child // Start from the last non-leaf node and go up to the root of the tree // Function to perform the minHeapify operation on a min-heap. // Compare the left child with the current smallest node. // Compare the right child with the current smallest node. // If the current node is not the smallest // swap it with the smallest child. // Define a function to perform min-heapify operation on an array // Check if left child is smaller than the current smallest element // Check if right child is smaller than the current smallest element // If the smallest element is not the current element, swap them // Call the main function to start the process\n\nThe time complexity of heapify in a min-heap is O(n).\n\nTo search for an element in the min heap, a linear search can be performed over the array that represents the heap. However, the time complexity of a linear search is O(n), which is not efficient. Therefore, searching is not a commonly used operation in a min heap.\n\nHere’s an example code that shows how to search for an element in a min heap using std::find():\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the priority queue.\n\nThe insertion operation has a time complexity of O(log n) in the worst case because the heap property needs to be maintained. The search operation involves copying the priority queue to a temporary queue and then traversing the temporary queue, which takes O(n log n) time in the worst case because each element needs to be copied and popped from the queue, and the priority queue needs to be rebuilt for each operation.\n\nThe space complexity of the program is O(n) because it stores n elements in the priority queue and creates a temporary queue with n elements.\n• Heap sort: Min heap is used as a key component in heap sort algorithm which is an efficient sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(nlogn).\n• Priority Queue: A priority queue can be implemented using a min heap data structure where the element with the minimum value is always at the root.\n• Dijkstra’s algorithm: In Dijkstra’s algorithm, a min heap is used to store the vertices of the graph with the minimum distance from the starting vertex. The vertex with the minimum distance is always at the root of the heap.\n• Huffman coding: In Huffman coding, a min heap is used to implement a priority queue to build an optimal prefix code for a given set of characters.\n• Merge K sorted arrays: Given K sorted arrays, we can merge them into a single sorted array efficiently using a min heap data structure.\n• Efficient insertion and deletion : Min heap allows fast insertion and deletion of elements with a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the heap.\n• Efficient retrieval of minimum element: The minimum element in a min heap is always at the root of the heap, which can be retrieved in O(1) time.\n• Space efficient: Min heap is a compact data structure that can be implemented using an array or a binary tree, which makes it space efficient.\n• Sorting: Min heap can be used to implement an efficient sorting algorithm such as heap sort with a time complexity of O(n log n).\n• Priority Queue: Min heap can be used to implement a priority queue, where the element with the minimum priority can be retrieved efficiently in O(1) time.\n• Versatility: Min heap has several applications in computer science, including graph algorithms, data compression, and database systems.\n\nOverall, min heap is a useful and versatile data structure that offers efficient operations, space efficiency, and has several applications in computer science."

        "document": "A Min Heap Binary Tree is a Binary Tree where the root node has the minimum key in the tree.\n\nThe above definition holds true for all sub-trees in the tree. This is called the Min Heap property.\n\nAlmost every node other than the last two layers must have two children. That is, this is almost a complete binary tree, with the exception of the last 2 layers.\n\nThe below tree is an example of a min heap binary tree since the above two properties hold.\n\nNow that we’ve covered what a min heap tree is, let’s look at how we can represent it.\n\nA Min Heap Binary Tree is commonly represented as an array, which is indexed according to the below format:\n\nThe root of the whole tree is at .\n\nWe will use the indexing as shown in the below figure. It’s not very hard to find the pattern here, which will match with the above table.\n\nThis indexing follows a Level Order Traversal of the Binary Tree, so a Binary Heap array is a Binary Tree using a level order traversal.\n\nThe above figure shows the array representation of the Min Heap Tree.\n\nNow that we’ve covered the concepts, let’s move onto implementing this in C!\n\nWe will use the array representation to build the tree. Let’s start writing the structure for the Min Heap.\n\nWe’ll have an array of elements, and a size, which gets updated as elements are being inserted or deleted.\n\nThe array also has a capacity, which indicates the maximum size of the array.\n\nThere are a few functions that we need to write to indicate that we are representing a Min Heap Tree, like finding the parent, and the children.\n\nWe’ll write functions to initialize and free the heap.\n\nWith that covered, let’s now move on to how we can insert elements!\n\nThe insertion algorithm is simple. This inserts an element into the tree.\n• First, always insert at the bottom of the tree. The initial position of the inserted element is at the last level.\n• We will now need to update the position of this element so that the min-heap property is satisfied.\n• Since the root node of every sub-tree must be the minimum, check the sub-tree of its immediate parent.\n• If the parent is greater than this inserted element, we need to update its position by swapping it.\n• But we are not yet done, since the min-heap property may be violated of the updated node’s sub-tree!\n• We need to keep swapping until we reach the root node, after which we are done.\n\nTo understand this procedure, let’s take an example.\n\nConsider the tree below, having only one element.\n\nLet’s insert the element 40. Since there is only one element, it inserts to the bottom, and we observe that the min-heap property is satisfies, since 10 < 40. So there is no need to swap.\n\nNext, we’ll insert 5. So now, we first insert to the bottom of the tree, at index 3.\n\nThe min heap property is violated for the sub-tree 1-3, and therefore, for the whole tree. So, we must keep swapping with the parent until we reach the root.\n\nSo, we need one more swap, since again, the min-heap property is violated for the sub-tree rooted at node 0.\n\nAlright. Now that we have visualized it, let’s write it down!\n\nBefore we look at deleting an element any index, since the min-heap is very closely associated with the root, we will look at deleting the root first.\n\nTo delete the minimum element (i.e the root), we will do the following:\n• Update the root as the last element of the array (tree)\n• We will now remove the last element at the bottom. This is similar to swapping and deleting at the end! Only because we don’t care about the root value anymore, we simply update it instead.\n• The problem again is that we need to maintain the min-heap property.\n• So we must ensure that the whole tree maintains this property. We will use a function called to do this for us.\n\nSo, we know that the deletion method will be complete after we do the method as well.\n\nThis function takes in an element index , and maintains the min heap property, by swapping with the smallest element of its immediate sub-tree.\n\nThe resulting tree will satisfy the min-heap property.\n\nThis involves finding the minimum element of the sub-tree and performing a swap with the current element.\n\nAfter this, we still need to make sure the entire tree satisfies this. So, we need to recursively call the procedure on the smallest element, until we reach the root!\n\nWe can now extend this function, to delete any element.\n\nThis involves only setting the desired element to the minimum possible value, that will be , since it must be lesser than the current minimum.\n\nWe will now keep swapping until we update the position so that the new root is this element.\n\nNow, we’re back at our old function! We can simply delete the new root!\n\nWith this, our entire deletion procedure will look like this:\n\nPhew! We’re finally done. I’ll now show you the entire code until now, along with the function, to visualize the tree.\n\nThe time complexities of the above procedures are mentioned below:\n\nYou can download the complete code as a Github Gist that I have uploaded. If you have any queries regarding this, do ask them in the comment section below!\n\nIn this article, we learned how we can represent a Min Heap Binary Tree, and also look at an implementation in C.\n• An illustration of Heaps, from Cormen"

        "document": "Elements in a max heap follow the max heap property. This means that the key at the parent node is always greater than the key at both child nodes. To build a max heap, you:\n• Create a new node at the beginning (root) of the heap.\n• Compare the value of the child node with the parent node.\n• Swap nodes if the value of the parent is less than that of either child (to the left or right).\n• Repeat until the largest element is at the root parent nodes (then you can say that the heap property holds).\n\nThese steps can also be followed when inserting new elements into a heap. The key here is, whatever operation being carried out on a Max Heap, the heap property must be maintained.\n\nTo remove/delete a root node in a Max Heap, you:\n• Move the last child node of the last level to root.\n• Compare the parent node with its children.\n• If the value of the parent is less than child nodes, swap them, and repeat until the heap property is satisfied.\n\nLet’s take a look at what this looks like in code. In the next section, we will implement a max heap using JavaScript.\n\nBefore we get into building a Max Heap, take a look at some of the methods we’ll implement and what they do:\n• : restores the heap property from a child node to a root node.\n• : restores the heap property from a specific node down to leaf nodes.\n• : appends a given value to the heap array and rearranges elements based on their heap property. On every new insert, the heap grows uniformly, and the size increases by one.\n• : returns the maximum value in the heap (root node) without modifying the heap. Note that the time complexity here is constant time\n• : returns and removes the maximum value in the heap (think of ). The time complexity of this function is in .\n\nIf the heap size is greater than one, it stores the maximum value to a variable, swaps that value with the last leaf, and deletes the maximum value from the heap. If the heap has just one element, it deletes and returns the value of that element, the last condition is if the heap is empty, it returns null.\n\nThe method is called recursively on each parent node until the root is reached. For every node to be positioned following the max-heap property, we call the method at every index of that array, starting from the bottom of the heap."

        "document": "Min Heap in Python and its Operations\n\nThis article was published as a part of the Data Science Blogathon.\n\nWe will es Python’s min-heap mean? A heap’s time complexity and applications. Finally, we’ll examine the distinction between a min and max heap. Let us begin immediately!\n\nMin heap vely. A data structure known as a heap is referred to as a heap. Heaps, in general, are similar to trees in that they have a large number of nodes. In a heap, the last node might be either empty or full. The parent node and the child node make up a heap. A binary heap is another term for a heap. If you’re using the max heap, the parent node is always bigger than or equal to the child node. It is also important to note that a parent node is always less than or equal to a child node in the min-heap.\n\nWhat does Python’s min-heap mean?\n\nA min-heap is a collection of nodes. It is one of the heap types. There are two sorts of nodes in a min-heap. A heap contains two nodes: a parent node, or root node, and a child node. A parent or root node’s value should always be less than or equal to the value of the child node in the min-heap. When the parent node exceeds the child node, the heap becomes the max heap. Priority is always given to the smallest element in a min-heap. It is arranged in ascending order.\n\nAs can be seen, none of the parent nodes exceeds the child node. Thus, this is the ideal illustration of a min-heap. If this criterion is not met, the heap is minimal.\n\nImplementation of min heap using library functions in python\n\nExplanation: Here, we will generate a minimal pile using the heapq library. Utilizing all procedures to create a minimal heap. It will indicate which node is the parent and which is the child. Additionally, it will provide the heap’s minimal value, determining which node is the parent.\n\nAs is well known, the minimum heap is a binary tree, and an array is always a representation of a min-heap. The root element of the min-heap is array[0].\n\nWhich operations are accessible in the minimal heap?\n• It is useful to get the parent node of the min heap.\n• The minimal element from the min-heap is removed with this operation.\n• The time complexity of the extractMin() method is O(log n).\n• None After deleting the parent node, extractMin() keeps the heap property.\n\nExplanation: We are creating a min-heap using python and utilizing all procedures to develop a minimum heap. It will indicate which node is the parent and which is the child. Additionally, it will provide the heap’s minimal value, determining which node is the parent.\n• Heap data structures are used for a k-way merging.\n• Graph algorithms like prim’s algorithm use the heap data structure.\n• This is advantageous for order statistics.\n\nWe have finally come to the end of this article. We have learned a lot about the min-heap in Python, and we will continue to learn more. Heap is a data structure that may be used in various situations.

Min-heaps have widespread applications in algorithms and systems that rely on efficient access to minimum values, including Dijkstra’s algorithm, scheduling systems, and graph algorithms.\n\nThis how-to guide will provide Python developers with a comprehensive overview of min-heaps and detailed step-by-step instructions for implementing a min-heap class in Python. We will cover min-heap properties, use cases, time complexities, and walk through coding a MinHeap class with and methods. Relevant examples and best practices for Python coding style, documentation, and testing will be included.\n\nBy the end of this guide, readers should have a strong conceptual understanding of min-heaps and the skills to implement a fully functional min-heap in Python to integrate into their own projects and applications. The information presented aims to be accessible for Python developers at all skill levels.\n\nA min-heap is a complete binary tree (a tree where all levels are filled except the last) that satisfies the heap property - each node is less than or equal to its child nodes. The root node of the min-heap contains the minimum value in the tree.\n• Complete binary tree structure: Min-heaps are complete binary trees, meaning they are filled row-by-row from left to right except the bottom row, which may be incomplete.\n• Heap property: The value of each node must be less than or equal to the value of its child nodes. The minimum value is always at the root.\n• Height: As a complete binary tree, the height (longest path from root to leaf) of a min-heap with N nodes is O(log N).\n• Inserts and extracts in O(log N) time: By maintaining the complete tree structure, inserts and extracts take O(log N) time.\n\nDue to their structure, min-heaps are extremely useful for the following:\n• Graph algorithms: Min-heaps speed up algorithms like Dijkstra’s shortest path, which relies on extracting minimum values.\n• Scheduling systems: The minimum value can be extracted efficiently to determine the next task to schedule.\n• Sorting: Min-heaps can be used to heapsort a dataset by repeatedly extracting the min into a sorted array.\n\nThe two core operations used in a min-heap are:\n\nTo insert a new element into the min-heap:\n• Add the new element to the end of the heap array.\n• Compare the added element with its parent; if it is less than its parent, swap it.\n• Continue bubbling the element up, swapping with parents as necessary, until it is no longer less than its parent.\n\nTo extract the minimum value from the min-heap:\n• Save the minimum value from the root node.\n• Move the last element in the heap to the root.\n• Compare the new root with its children; if greater than either child, swap with the smaller child.\n• Continue sinking the new root downwards, swapping with smaller children, until the min-heap property is restored.\n\nMaintaining the min-heap structure through swaps ensures inserts and extracts take O(log N) time.\n\nWe will now walk through how to implement a class in Python containing and methods along with a helper method.\n\nFirst we’ll define the overall class:\n\nThe constructor initializes the underlying heap list as a Python list containing a value at index 0. This allows for easier index calculations, since for any node at index k, its children are at and .\n\ntracks the number of elements in the heap.\n\nThe method adds a new element to the heap:\n\nIt increments the count, appends the new element to the end of the heap list, and calls to restore the heap structure.\n\nThe method removes and returns the minimum element:\n\nIt first handles the edge case of an empty heap. Otherwise, it saves the root minimum, replaces it with the last element in the heap, decrements the count, and removes the now-duplicated last element. Calling on the new root restores the heap property.\n\nbubbles a new element up to restore the heap structure:\n\nIt swaps the element with its parent if it is less than its parent, and continues recursively bubbling up. Base cases are reaching index 1 or being greater than or equal to the parent.\n\nIt compares the root to its left and right children, swapping with the smaller child until the heap property is satisfied.\n\nThis provides a full implementation of and along with the helper methods to maintain the min-heap structure.\n\nWe can test our class:\n\nThis inserts 5 elements, extracts the minimums in order, and prints 2, 3, 5.\n\nThe time complexities of operations on a MinHeap with N elements are:\n\nAt most log N swaps are required to bubble up or down to restore the heap structure.\n\nThe space complexity is O(N) since we store N heap elements.\n\nTo properly test this implementation, we should write unit tests covering typical min-heap use cases and edge cases:\n\nThis includes test cases for inserts, extracts, and empty heaps. Running would run these tests against our implementation.\n\nThere are a few variations on min-heap implementations in Python:\n• Using a Python as done here is simple but not cache-efficient. For larger heaps, a improves cache performance.\n• Can also implement with a class representing heap nodes, not just a list. Allows storing extra data per node.\n• The heap structure can also be represented using a binary tree class with references between nodes. May simplify visualization.\n• Python’s module provides min-heap implementation in the standard library, but lacks a full class interface.\n\nSome examples of how min-heaps are used in real systems:\n• Dijkstra’s Algorithm uses a min-heap to quickly extract the unvisited vertex with the smallest distance for each iteration. Significantly speeds up pathfinding.\n• Job schedulers like Apache Hadoop place jobs in a min-heap to always extract the shortest job to run next for optimal throughput.\n• Memory management can use a min-heap to find the smallest unused memory block to allocate on a request.\n• Graph algorithms use min-heaps as priority queues for primality testing, finding minimum spanning trees, and detecting shortest paths.\n• Sorting algorithms like heapsort use a min-heap to efficiently sort data.\n\nThis guide provided a comprehensive walkthrough of min-heaps and how to implement them in Python. We covered the key concepts, properties, operations, and applications of min-heaps. Detailed Python code samples, complexity analysis, testing techniques, and real-world examples were included to give developers a solid technical foundation as well as practical coding skills to build min-heaps. Readers should now have the understanding to integrate min-heaps into their own Python projects to efficiently access minimum values. There are many exciting applications of min-heaps across data structures, algorithms, and systems programming."

If the parent is greater than the new element, swap them.\n• None Repeat step 2 until the parent is smaller than or equal to the new element, or until the new element reaches the root of the tree.\n• None The new element is now in its correct position in the min heap, and the heap property is satisfied.\n\n// Function to insert a new element into the min-heap // Add the new element to the end of the heap // Get the index of the last element // Compare the new element with its parent and swap if // Move up the tree to the parent of the current // Function to insert a new element into the min-heap // Add the new element to the end of the heap // Get the index of the last element // Compare the new element with its parent and swap // Move up the tree to the parent of the current // Function to swap two elements in an array # Add the new element to the end of the heap # Get the index of the last element # Compare the new element with its parent and swap if necessary # Move up the tree to the parent of the current element // Function to insert a new element into the min-heap // Add the new element to the end of the heap // Get the index of the last element // Compare the new element with its parent and swap // Move up the tree to the parent of the current\n\nTime Complexity: O(log(n)) (where n is no of elements in the heap)\n\nAuxiliary Space: O(n)\n\nRemoving the smallest element (the root) from the min heap. The root is replaced by the last element in the heap, and then the heap property is restored by swapping the new root with its smallest child until the parent is smaller than both children or until the new root reaches a leaf node.\n• None Replace the root or element to be deleted with the last element.\n• None Delete the last element from the Heap.\n• None Since the last element is now placed at the position of the root node. So, it may not follow the heap property. Therefore, heapify the last node placed at the position of the root.\n\n// Function to insert a new element into the min-heap // Add the new element to the end of the heap // Get the index of the last element // Compare the new element with its parent and swap if // Move up the tree to the parent of the current // Function to delete a node from the min-heap // Find the index of the element to be deleted // If the element is not found, return // Replace the element to be deleted with the last // Heapify the tree starting from the element at the // Main function to test the insert_min_heap and // Function to insert a new element into the min-heap // Add the new element to the end of the heap // Get the index of the last element // Compare the new element with its parent and swap // Move up the tree to the parent of the current // Function to delete a node from the min-heap // Find the index of the element to be deleted // If the element is not found, return // Replace the element to be deleted with the last // Heapify the tree starting from the element at the // Main function to test the insertMinHeap and // Add the new element to the end of the heap // Get the index of the last element // Compare the new element with its parent and swap if necessary // Move up the tree to the parent of the current element // Find the index of the element to be deleted // If the element is not found, return // Replace the element to be deleted with the last element // Heapify the tree starting from the element at the deleted index // Main function to test the insertMinHeap and deleteMinHeap functions\n\nTime complexity: O(log n) where n is no of elements in the heap\n\nAuxiliary Space: O(n)\n\nTo access the minimum element (i.e., the root of the heap), the value of the root node is returned. The time complexity of peek in a min-heap is O(1).\n\nTime complexity: In a min heap implemented using an array or a list, the peak element can be accessed in constant time, O(1), as it is always located at the root of the heap.\n\nIn a min heap implemented using a binary tree, the peak element can also be accessed in O(1) time, as it is always located at the root of the tree.\n\nA heapify operation can be used to create a min heap from an unsorted array. This is done by starting at the last non-leaf node and repeatedly performing the “bubble down” operation until all nodes satisfy the heap property.\n\n// Function to maintain the min-heap property of the heap rooted at index 'i' // Assume the root is the smallest element initially // Calculate the indices of the left and right child of the current node // Compare the left child with the current smallest // Compare the right child with the current smallest // If the current node is not the smallest, swap it with the smallest child // Recursively heapify the subtree rooted at the smallest child // Start from the last non-leaf node and go up to the root of the tree // Function to perform the minHeapify operation on a min-heap. // Compare the left child with the current smallest node. // Compare the right child with the current smallest node. // If the current node is not the smallest // swap it with the smallest child. // Define a function to perform min-heapify operation on an array // Check if left child is smaller than the current smallest element // Check if right child is smaller than the current smallest element // If the smallest element is not the current element, swap them // Call the main function to start the process\n\nThe time complexity of heapify in a min-heap is O(n).\n\nTo search for an element in the min heap, a linear search can be performed over the array that represents the heap. However, the time complexity of a linear search is O(n), which is not efficient. Therefore, searching is not a commonly used operation in a min heap.\n\nHere’s an example code that shows how to search for an element in a min heap using std::find():\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the priority queue.\n\nThe insertion operation has a time complexity of O(log n) in the worst case because the heap property needs to be maintained. The search operation involves copying the priority queue to a temporary queue and then traversing the temporary queue, which takes O(n log n) time in the worst case because each element needs to be copied and popped from the queue, and the priority queue needs to be rebuilt for each operation.\n\nThe space complexity of the program is O(n) because it stores n elements in the priority queue and creates a temporary queue with n elements.\n• Heap sort: Min heap is used as a key component in heap sort algorithm which is an efficient sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(nlogn).\n• Priority Queue: A priority queue can be implemented using a min heap data structure where the element with the minimum value is always at the root.\n• Dijkstra’s algorithm: In Dijkstra’s algorithm, a min heap is used to store the vertices of the graph with the minimum distance from the starting vertex. The vertex with the minimum distance is always at the root of the heap.\n• Huffman coding: In Huffman coding, a min heap is used to implement a priority queue to build an optimal prefix code for a given set of characters.\n• Merge K sorted arrays: Given K sorted arrays, we can merge them into a single sorted array efficiently using a min heap data structure.\n• Efficient insertion and deletion : Min heap allows fast insertion and deletion of elements with a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the heap.\n• Efficient retrieval of minimum element: The minimum element in a min heap is always at the root of the heap, which can be retrieved in O(1) time.\n• Space efficient: Min heap is a compact data structure that can be implemented using an array or a binary tree, which makes it space efficient.\n• Sorting: Min heap can be used to implement an efficient sorting algorithm such as heap sort with a time complexity of O(n log n).\n• Priority Queue: Min heap can be used to implement a priority queue, where the element with the minimum priority can be retrieved efficiently in O(1) time.\n• Versatility: Min heap has several applications in computer science, including graph algorithms, data compression, and database systems.\n\nOverall, min heap is a useful and versatile data structure that offers efficient operations, space efficiency, and has several applications in computer science."

Our content is crafted by top technical writers with deep knowledge in the fields of computer science and data science, ensuring each piece is meticulously reviewed by a team of seasoned editors to guarantee compliance with the highest standards in educational content creation and publishing.\n\nPython is versatile with a wide range of data structures. One such is the heap. While they are not as commonly used, they can be incredibly useful in certain scenarios. In this article, we will learn what a heap is in Python. We will also understand how to implement max heap and min heap concepts and the difference between them. So, let's get started!\n\nWhat is Heap in Python?\n\nA heap in Python is a data structure based on a unique binary tree designed to efficiently access the smallest or largest element in a collection of items. It follows a complete binary tree's property and satisfies the heap property. Therefore, it is also known as a binary heap.\n\nAs we all know, the complete binary tree is a tree with every level filled and all the nodes are as far left as possible. In the binary tree, it is possible that the last level is empty and not filled. Now, you must be wondering what is the heap property.\n\nIn the heap data structure, we assign key-value or weight to every node of the tree. Now, the root node key value is compared with the children’s nodes and then the tree is arranged accordingly into two categories i.e., max-heap and min-heap.\n\nThe heap data structure is basically used as a heapsort algorithm to sort the elements in an array or a list. These algorithms can be used in priority queues, order statistics, Prim's algorithm or Dijkstra's algorithm, etc.\n\nAs learned earlier, there are two categories of heap data structure i.e. max-heap and min-heap. Let us understand them below but before that, we will study the heapify property to understand max-heap and min-heap.\n\nWhat is the use of a heap?\n\nPython uses the heap data structure as it is a highly efficient method of storing a collection of ordered elements. It is useful for keeping track of the largest and smallest elements in a collection, which is a common task in many algorithms and data structures. Priority queues, which are commonly used in task scheduling and network routing, are also implemented using the heap.\n\nHow to create a heap in Python\n\nYou can create a heap data structure in Python using the heapq module. To create a heap, you can start by creating an empty list and then use the heappush function to add elements to the heap.\n\nAccording to Official Python Docs, this module provides an implementation of the heap queue algorithm, also known as the priority queue algorithm.\n\nThe process of creating a heap data structure using the binary tree is called Heapify. The heapify process is used to create the Max-Heap or the Min-Heap. Let us study the Heapify using an example below:\n\nConsider the input array as shown in the figure below:\n\nUsing this array, we will create the complete binary tree:\n\nWe will start the process of heapify from the first index of the non-leaf node as shown below:\n\nNow we will set the current element “k” as “largest” and as we know the index of a left child is given by “2k + 1” and the right child is given by “2k + 2”.\n\nTherefore, if the left child is larger than the current element i.e. kth index we will set the “largest” with the left child’s index, and if the right child is larger than the current element i.e., kth index then we will set the “largest” with right child’s index.\n\nLastly, we will swap the “largest” element with the current element(kth element).\n\nWe’ll repeat the above steps 3-6 until the tree is heaped.\n\nHere is the algorithm for Max Heapify:\n\nHere is the algorithm for Min Heapify:\n\nWhen the value of each internal node is larger than or equal to the value of its children node then it is called the Max-Heap Property. Also, in a max-heap, the value of the root node is largest among all the other nodes of the tree. Therefore, if “a” has a child node “b” then:\n\nrepresents the Max-Heap Property. Let us display the max-heap using an array. Therefore, the root node will be arr[0]. So, for kth node i.e., arr[k]:\n\nHere is the Python implementation with full code for Max Heap:\n\nWhen the value of each internal node is smaller than the value of its children node then it is called the Min-Heap Property. Also, in the min-heap, the value of the root node is the smallest among all the other nodes of the tree. Therefore, if “a” has a child node “b” then:\n\nrepresents the Min Heap Property. Let us display the max heap using an array. Therefore, the root node will be arr[0]. So, for kth node i.e., arr[k]:\n\nHere is the Python implementation with full code for Min Heap:\n\nHere are the key difference between Min and Max Heap in Python:\n\nThe running time complexity of the building heap is O(n log(n)) where each call for heapify costs O(log(n)) and the cost of building heap is O(n). Therefore, the overall time complexity will be O(n log(n)).\n\nA heap is used for a variety of purposes. It is a powerful tool used in sorting, searching, and graph traversal algorithms, as well as other applications requiring efficient management of a collection of ordered elements. Following are some of the main practical applications of it:\n• Heap is used while implementing a priority queue. It is another data structure to access and remove the item in the highest priority.\n• It is used in the Heap sort, selection algorithm, Prim’s algo, and Dijkstra's algorithm.\n• We can use max-heap and min-heap in the operating system for the job scheduling algorithm.\n• It is used in order statistics, for tasks like how to find the median of a list of numbers.\n\nOverall, the Heap data structure in Python is very useful when it comes to working with graphs or trees. It helps us improve the efficiency of various programs and problem statements. You also know how to implement max heap and min heap with their algorithms and full code."
