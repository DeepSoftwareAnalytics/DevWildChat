        "document": "How to use fixtures¶\n\nAt a basic level, test functions request fixtures they require by declaring them as arguments. When pytest goes to run a test, it looks at the parameters in that test function’s signature, and then searches for fixtures that have the same names as those parameters. Once pytest finds them, it runs those fixtures, captures what they returned (if anything), and passes those objects into the test function as arguments. In this example, “requests” (i.e. ), and when pytest sees this, it will execute the fixture function and pass the object it returns into as the argument. Here’s roughly what’s happening if we were to do it by hand: One of pytest’s greatest strengths is its extremely flexible fixture system. It allows us to boil down complex requirements for tests into more simple and organized functions, where we only need to have each one describe the things they are dependent on. We’ll get more into this further down, but for now, here’s a quick example to demonstrate how fixtures can use other fixtures: Notice that this is the same example from above, but very little changed. The fixtures in pytest request fixtures just like tests. All the same requesting rules apply to fixtures that do for tests. Here’s how this example would work if we did it by hand: One of the things that makes pytest’s fixture system so powerful, is that it gives us the ability to define a generic setup step that can be reused over and over, just like a normal function would be used. Two different tests can request the same fixture and have pytest give each test their own result from that fixture. This is extremely useful for making sure tests aren’t affected by each other. We can use this system to make sure each test gets its own fresh batch of data and is starting from a clean state so it can provide consistent, repeatable results. Here’s an example of how this can come in handy: Each test here is being given its own copy of that object, which means the fixture is getting executed twice (the same is true for the fixture). If we were to do this by hand as well, it would look something like this: A test/fixture can request more than one fixture at a time¶ Tests and fixtures aren’t limited to requesting a single fixture at a time. They can request as many as they like. Here’s another quick example to demonstrate: Fixtures can be requested more than once per test (return values are cached)¶ Fixtures can also be requested more than once during the same test, and pytest won’t execute them again for that test. This means we can request fixtures in multiple fixtures that are dependent on them (and even again in the test itself) without those fixtures being executed more than once. If a requested fixture was executed once for every time it was requested during a test, then this test would fail because both and would see as an empty list (i.e. ), but since the return value of was cached (along with any side effects executing it may have had) after the first time it was called, both the test and were referencing the same object, and the test saw the effect had on that object.\n\nFixtures requiring network access depend on connectivity and are usually time-expensive to create. Extending the previous example, we can add a parameter to the invocation to cause a fixture function, responsible to create a connection to a preexisting SMTP server, to only be invoked once per test module (the default is to invoke once per test function). Multiple test functions in a test module will thus each receive the same fixture instance, thus saving time. Possible values for are: , , , or . The next example puts the fixture function into a separate file so that tests from multiple test modules in the directory can access the fixture function: Here, the needs the fixture value. pytest will discover and call the marked fixture function. Running the test looks like this: $ pytest test_module.py platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y rootdir: /home/sweet/project collected 2 items test_module.py ================================= FAILURES ================================= smtp_connection = <smtplib.SMTP object at 0xdeadbeef0001> def test_ehlo(smtp_connection): response, msg = smtp_connection.ehlo() assert response == 250 assert b\"smtp.gmail.com\" in msg > assert 0 # for demo purposes :7: AssertionError smtp_connection = <smtplib.SMTP object at 0xdeadbeef0001> def test_noop(smtp_connection): response, msg = smtp_connection.noop() assert response == 250 > assert 0 # for demo purposes :13: AssertionError test_module.py:: - assert 0 test_module.py:: - assert 0 You see the two failing and more importantly you can also see that the exactly same object was passed into the two test functions because pytest shows the incoming argument values in the traceback. As a result, the two test functions using run as quick as a single one because they reuse the same instance. If you decide that you rather want to have a session-scoped instance, you can simply declare it: # the returned fixture value will be shared for Fixtures are created when first requested by a test, and are destroyed based on their :\n• None : the default scope, the fixture is destroyed at the end of the test.\n• None : the fixture is destroyed during teardown of the last test in the class.\n• None : the fixture is destroyed during teardown of the last test in the module.\n• None : the fixture is destroyed during teardown of the last test in the package where the fixture is defined, including sub-packages and sub-directories within it.\n• None : the fixture is destroyed at the end of the test session. Pytest only caches one instance of a fixture at a time, which means that when using a parametrized fixture, pytest may invoke a fixture more than once in the given scope. In some cases, you might want to change the scope of the fixture without changing the code. To do that, pass a callable to . The callable must return a string with a valid scope and will be executed only once - during the fixture definition. It will be called with two keyword arguments - as a string and with a configuration object. This can be especially useful when dealing with fixtures that need time for setup, like spawning a docker container. You can use the command-line argument to control the scope of the spawned containers for different environments. See the example below.\n\nWhen we run our tests, we’ll want to make sure they clean up after themselves so they don’t mess with any other tests (and also so that we don’t leave behind a mountain of test data to bloat the system). Fixtures in pytest offer a very useful teardown system, which allows us to define the specific steps necessary for each fixture to clean up after itself. This system can be leveraged in two ways. “Yield” fixtures instead of . With these fixtures, we can run some code and pass an object back to the requesting fixture/test, just like with the other fixtures. The only differences are:\n• None is swapped out for .\n• None Any teardown code for that fixture is placed after the . Once pytest figures out a linear order for the fixtures, it will run each one up until it returns or yields, and then move on to the next fixture in the list to do the same thing. Once the test is finished, pytest will go back down the list of fixtures, but in the reverse order, taking each one that yielded, and running the code inside it that was after the statement. As a simple example, consider this basic email module: Let’s say we want to test sending email from one user to another. We’ll have to first make each user, then send the email from one user to the other, and finally assert that the other user received that message in their inbox. If we want to clean up after the test runs, we’ll likely have to make sure the other user’s mailbox is emptied before deleting that user, otherwise the system may complain. Here’s what that might look like: Because is the last fixture to run during setup, it’s the first to run during teardown. There is a risk that even having the order right on the teardown side of things doesn’t guarantee a safe cleanup. That’s covered in a bit more detail in Safe teardowns. If a yield fixture raises an exception before yielding, pytest won’t try to run the teardown code after that yield fixture’s statement. But, for every fixture that has already run successfully for that test, pytest will still attempt to tear them down as it normally would. While yield fixtures are considered to be the cleaner and more straightforward option, there is another choice, and that is to add “finalizer” functions directly to the test’s request-context object. It brings a similar result as yield fixtures, but requires a bit more verbosity. In order to use this approach, we have to request the request-context object (just like we would request another fixture) in the fixture we need to add teardown code for, and then pass a callable, containing that teardown code, to its method. We have to be careful though, because pytest will run that finalizer once it’s been added, even if that fixture raises an exception after adding the finalizer. So to make sure we don’t run the finalizer code when we wouldn’t need to, we would only add the finalizer once the fixture would have done something that we’d need to teardown. Here’s how the previous example would look using the method: It’s a bit longer than yield fixtures and a bit more complex, but it does offer some nuances for when you’re in a pinch. Finalizers are executed in a first-in-last-out order. For yield fixtures, the first teardown code to run is from the right-most fixture, i.e. the last test parameter. For finalizers, the first fixture to run is last call to . This is so because yield fixtures use behind the scenes: when the fixture executes, registers a function that resumes the generator, which in turn calls the teardown code.\n\nThe fixture system of pytest is very powerful, but it’s still being run by a computer, so it isn’t able to figure out how to safely teardown everything we throw at it. If we aren’t careful, an error in the wrong spot might leave stuff from our tests behind, and that can cause further issues pretty quickly. For example, consider the following tests (based off of the mail example from above): This version is a lot more compact, but it’s also harder to read, doesn’t have a very descriptive fixture name, and none of the fixtures can be reused easily. There’s also a more serious issue, which is that if any of those steps in the setup raise an exception, none of the teardown code will run. One option might be to go with the method instead of yield fixtures, but that might get pretty complex and difficult to maintain (and it wouldn’t be compact anymore). The safest and simplest fixture structure requires limiting fixtures to only making one state-changing action each, and then bundling them together with their teardown code, as the email examples above showed. The chance that a state-changing operation can fail but still modify state is negligible, as most of these operations tend to be transaction-based (at least at the level of testing where state could be left behind). So if we make sure that any successful state-changing action gets torn down by moving it to a separate fixture function and separating it from other, potentially failing state-changing actions, then our tests will stand the best chance at leaving the test environment the way they found it. For an example, let’s say we have a website with a login page, and we have access to an admin API where we can generate users. For our test, we want to:\n• None Go to the login page of our site\n• None Log in as the user we created\n• None Assert that their name is in the header of the landing page We wouldn’t want to leave that user in the system, nor would we want to leave that browser session running, so we’ll want to make sure the fixtures that create those things clean up after themselves. Here’s what that might look like: For this example, certain fixtures (i.e. and ) are implied to exist elsewhere. So for now, let’s assume they exist, and we’re just not looking at them. The way the dependencies are laid out means it’s unclear if the fixture would execute before the fixture. But that’s ok, because those are atomic operations, and so it doesn’t matter which one runs first because the sequence of events for the test is still linearizable. But what does matter is that, no matter which one runs first, if the one raises an exception while the other would not have, neither will have left anything behind. If executes before , and raises an exception, the driver will still quit, and the user was never made. And if was the one to raise the exception, then the driver would never have been started and the user would never have been made.\n\nSometimes you may want to run multiple asserts after doing all that setup, which makes sense as, in more complex systems, a single action can kick off multiple behaviors. pytest has a convenient way of handling this and it combines a bunch of what we’ve gone over so far. All that’s needed is stepping up to a larger scope, then having the act step defined as an autouse fixture, and finally, making sure all the fixtures are targeting that higher level scope. Let’s pull an example from above, and tweak it a bit. Let’s say that in addition to checking for a welcome message in the header, we also want to check for a sign out button, and a link to the user’s profile. Let’s take a look at how we can structure that so we can run multiple asserts without having to repeat all those steps again. For this example, certain fixtures (i.e. and ) are implied to exist elsewhere. So for now, let’s assume they exist, and we’re just not looking at them. Notice that the methods are only referencing in the signature as a formality. No state is tied to the actual test class as it might be in the framework. Everything is managed by the pytest fixture system. Each method only has to request the fixtures that it actually needs without worrying about order. This is because the act fixture is an autouse fixture, and it made sure all the other fixtures executed before it. There’s no more changes of state that need to take place, so the tests are free to make as many non-state-changing queries as they want without risking stepping on the toes of the other tests. The fixture is defined inside the class as well, because not every one of the other tests in the module will be expecting a successful login, and the act may need to be handled a little differently for another test class. For example, if we wanted to write another test scenario around submitting bad credentials, we could handle it by adding something like this to the test file:\n\nFixture functions can be parametrized in which case they will be called multiple times, each time executing the set of dependent tests, i.e. the tests that depend on this fixture. Test functions usually do not need to be aware of their re-running. Fixture parametrization helps to write exhaustive functional tests for components which themselves can be configured in multiple ways. Extending the previous example, we can flag the fixture to create two fixture instances which will cause all tests using the fixture to run twice. The fixture function gets access to each parameter through the special object: The main change is the declaration of with , a list of values for each of which the fixture function will execute and can access a value via . No test function code needs to change. So let’s just do another run: $ pytest -q test_module.py ================================= FAILURES ================================= smtp_connection = <smtplib.SMTP object at 0xdeadbeef0004> def test_ehlo(smtp_connection): response, msg = smtp_connection.ehlo() assert response == 250 assert b\"smtp.gmail.com\" in msg > assert 0 # for demo purposes :7: AssertionError smtp_connection = <smtplib.SMTP object at 0xdeadbeef0004> def test_noop(smtp_connection): response, msg = smtp_connection.noop() assert response == 250 > assert 0 # for demo purposes :13: AssertionError smtp_connection = <smtplib.SMTP object at 0xdeadbeef0005> def test_ehlo(smtp_connection): response, msg = smtp_connection.ehlo() assert response == 250 > assert b\"smtp.gmail.com\" in msg :6: AssertionError -------------------------- Captured stdout setup --------------------------- finalizing <smtplib.SMTP object at 0xdeadbeef0004> smtp_connection = <smtplib.SMTP object at 0xdeadbeef0005> def test_noop(smtp_connection): response, msg = smtp_connection.noop() assert response == 250 > assert 0 # for demo purposes :13: AssertionError ------------------------- Captured stdout teardown ------------------------- finalizing <smtplib.SMTP object at 0xdeadbeef0005> test_module.py:: - assert 0 test_module.py:: - assert 0 test_module.py:: - AssertionError: asser... test_module.py:: - assert 0 We see that our two test functions each ran twice, against the different instances. Note also, that with the connection the second test fails in because a different server string is expected than what arrived. pytest will build a string that is the test ID for each fixture value in a parametrized fixture, e.g. and in the above examples. These IDs can be used with to select specific cases to run, and they will also identify the specific case when one is failing. Running pytest with will show the generated IDs. Numbers, strings, booleans and will have their usual string representation used in the test ID. For other objects, pytest will make a string based on the argument name. It is possible to customise the string used in a test ID for a certain fixture value by using the keyword argument: The above shows how can be either a list of strings to use or a function which will be called with the fixture value and then has to return a string to use. In the latter case if the function returns then pytest’s auto-generated ID will be used. Running the above tests results in the following test IDs being used:\n\npytest minimizes the number of active fixtures during test runs. If you have a parametrized fixture, then all the tests using it will first execute with one instance and then finalizers are called before the next fixture instance is created. Among other things, this eases testing of applications which create and use global state. The following example uses two parametrized fixtures, one of which is scoped on a per-module basis, and all the functions perform calls to show the setup/teardown flow: Let’s run the tests in verbose mode and with looking at the print-output: $ pytest -v -s test_module.py platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y -- $PYTHON_PREFIX/bin/python cachedir: .pytest_cache rootdir: /home/sweet/project collected 8 items test_module.py::test_0[1] SETUP otherarg 1 RUN test0 with otherarg 1 PASSED TEARDOWN otherarg 1 test_module.py::test_0[2] SETUP otherarg 2 RUN test0 with otherarg 2 PASSED TEARDOWN otherarg 2 test_module.py::test_1[mod1] SETUP modarg mod1 RUN test1 with modarg mod1 PASSED test_module.py::test_2[mod1-1] SETUP otherarg 1 RUN test2 with otherarg 1 and modarg mod1 PASSED TEARDOWN otherarg 1 test_module.py::test_2[mod1-2] SETUP otherarg 2 RUN test2 with otherarg 2 and modarg mod1 PASSED TEARDOWN otherarg 2 test_module.py::test_1[mod2] TEARDOWN modarg mod1 SETUP modarg mod2 RUN test1 with modarg mod2 PASSED test_module.py::test_2[mod2-1] SETUP otherarg 1 RUN test2 with otherarg 1 and modarg mod2 PASSED TEARDOWN otherarg 1 test_module.py::test_2[mod2-2] SETUP otherarg 2 RUN test2 with otherarg 2 and modarg mod2 PASSED TEARDOWN otherarg 2 TEARDOWN modarg mod2 You can see that the parametrized module-scoped resource caused an ordering of test execution that lead to the fewest possible “active” resources. The finalizer for the parametrized resource was executed before the resource was setup. In particular notice that test_0 is completely independent and finishes first. Then test_1 is executed with , then test_2 with , then test_1 with and finally test_2 with . The parametrized resource (having function scope) was set up before and teared down after every test that used it.\n\nUse fixtures in classes and modules with ¶ Sometimes test functions do not directly need access to a fixture object. For example, tests may require to operate with an empty directory as the current working directory but otherwise do not care for the concrete directory. Here is how you can use the standard and pytest fixtures to achieve it. We separate the creation of the fixture into a file: and declare its use in a test module via a marker: Due to the marker, the fixture will be required for the execution of each test method, just as if you specified a “cleandir” function argument to each of them. Let’s run it to verify our fixture is activated and the tests pass: You can specify multiple fixtures like this: and you may specify fixture usage at the test module level using : It is also possible to put fixtures required by all tests in your project into an ini-file: Note this mark has no effect in fixture functions. For example, this will not work as expected: This generates a deprecation warning, and will become an error in Pytest 8."

Here is a typical example of a test function that implements checking that a certain input leads to an expected output:\n\nHere, the decorator defines three different tuples so that the function will run three times using them in turn:\n\npytest by default escapes any non-ascii characters used in unicode strings for the parametrization because it has several downsides.

        "document": "allows to easily parametrize test functions. For basic docs, see How to parametrize fixtures and test functions.\n\nIn the following we provide some examples using the builtin mechanisms.\n\nLet’s say we want to execute a test with different computation parameters and the parameter range shall be determined by a command line argument. Let’s first write a simple (do-nothing) computation test: Now we add a test configuration like this: This means that we only run 2 tests if we do not pass : We run only two computations, so we see two dots. let’s run the full monty: As expected when running the full range of values we’ll get an error on the last one.\n\npytest will build a string that is the test ID for each set of values in a parametrized test. These IDs can be used with to select specific cases to run, and they will also identify the specific case when one is failing. Running pytest with will show the generated IDs. Numbers, strings, booleans and None will have their usual string representation used in the test ID. For other objects, pytest will make a string based on the argument name: In , we let pytest generate the test IDs. In , we specified as a list of strings which were used as the test IDs. These are succinct, but can be a pain to maintain. In , we specified as a function that can generate a string representation to make part of the test ID. So our values use the label generated by , but because we didn’t generate a label for objects, they are still using the default pytest representation: In , we used to specify the test IDs together with the actual data, instead of listing them separately.\n\nHere is a quick port to run tests configured with testscenarios, an add-on from Robert Collins for the standard unittest framework. We only have to work a bit to construct the correct arguments for pytest’s : this is a fully self-contained example which you can run with: If you just collect tests you’ll also nicely see ‘advanced’ and ‘basic’ as variants for the test function: Note that we told that your scenario values should be considered class-scoped. With pytest-2.3 this leads to a resource-based ordering.\n\nThe parametrization of test functions happens at collection time. It is a good idea to setup expensive resources like DB connections or subprocess only when the actual test is run. Here is a simple example how you can achieve that. This test requires a object fixture: We can now add a test configuration that generates two invocations of the function and also implements a factory that creates a database object for the actual test invocations: Let’s first see how it looks like at collection time: And then when we run the test: $ pytest -q test_backends.py ================================= FAILURES ================================= db = <conftest.DB2 object at 0xdeadbeef0001> def test_db_initialized(db): # a dummy test if db.__class__.__name__ == \"DB2\": > pytest.fail(\"deliberately failing for demo purposes\") :8: Failed test_backends.py:: - Failed: deliberately f... , The first invocation with passed while the second with failed. Our fixture function has instantiated each of the DB values during the setup phase while the generated two according calls to the during the collection phase.\n\nVery often parametrization uses more than one argument name. There is opportunity to apply parameter on particular arguments. It can be done by passing list or tuple of arguments’ names to . In the example below there is a function which uses two fixtures: and . Here we give to indirect the list, which contains the name of the fixture . The indirect parameter will be applied to this argument only, and the value will be passed to respective fixture function: The result of this test will be successful:\n\nHere is a stripped down real-life example of using parametrized testing for testing serialization of objects between different python interpreters. We define a function which is to be run with different sets of arguments for its three arguments:\n• None : first python interpreter, run to pickle-dump an object to a file\n• None : second interpreter, run to pickle-load an object from a file Running it results in some skips if we don’t have all the python interpreters installed and otherwise runs all combinations (3 interpreters times 3 interpreters times 3 objects to serialize/deserialize): . $ pytest -rs -q multipython.py [9] multipython.py:67: 'python3.9' not found [9] multipython.py:67: 'python3.10' not found [9] multipython.py:67: 'python3.11' not found\n\nIf you want to compare the outcomes of several implementations of a given API, you can write test functions that receive the already imported implementations and get skipped in case the implementation is not importable/available. Let’s say we have a “base” implementation and the other (possibly optimized ones) need to provide similar results: And then a base implementation of a simple function: If you run this with reporting for skips enabled: $ pytest -rs test_module.py platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y rootdir: /home/sweet/project collected 2 items test_module.py [1] test_module.py:3: could not import 'opt2': No module named 'opt2' , You’ll see that we don’t have an module and thus the second test run of our was skipped. A few notes:\n• None the fixture functions in the file are “session-scoped” because we don’t need to import more than once\n• None if you have multiple test functions and a skipped import, you will see the count increasing in the report\n• None you can put @pytest.mark.parametrize style parametrization on the test functions to parametrize input/output values as well.\n\nUse to apply marks or set test ID to individual parametrized test. For example: In this example, we have 4 parametrized tests. Except for the first test, we mark the rest three parametrized tests with the custom marker , and for the fourth test we also use the built-in mark to indicate this test is expected to fail. For explicitness, we set test ids for some tests. Then run with verbose mode and with only the marker:\n• None One test was deselected because it doesn’t have the mark.\n• None Three tests with the mark was selected.\n• None The test passed, but the name is autogenerated and confusing.\n• None The test was expected to fail and did fail.\n\nUse with the pytest.mark.parametrize decorator to write parametrized tests in which some tests raise exceptions and others do not. can be used to test cases that are not expected to raise exceptions but that should result in some value. The value is given as the parameter, which will be available as the statement’s target ( in the example below). \"\"\"Test how much I know division.\"\"\" In the example above, the first three test cases should run without any exceptions, while the fourth should raise a exception, which is expected by pytest."

        "document": "You can find the example solution using request.getfixture at the bottom of this post 🚀 Full code examples available in the e4ds-snippets GitHub repo\n\nDRY (do not repeat yourself) is a key concept in software development.\n\nWhen writing tests it can be easy to write repetitive code.\n\nFor example, you might find yourself writing the same snippet of code multiple times to create and use the same object across different tests. Or, writing multiple tests for the same function in order to test different inputs.\n\nNaturally, we want to minimise repetition as much as possible.\n\nPytest comes with two useful features to help avoid unnecessary repetition when writing tests:\n• Fixtures – allow you to define a test input once and share it across many test functions.\n• Parameterize – allows you to easily define and run multiple test cases for an individual test function.\n\nThese are two great features – so, it is logical to want to use them together.\n\nBut surprisingly, it is (still! ) not possible to directly use fixtures as arguments in .\n\nIn this post we will demonstrate how to use a workaround to allow you to use fixtures in parametrized tests.\n\nTake this small snippet of code that tackles a common task in data science and engineering – parsing a string to extract information.\n\nIn this example, the function takes a structured ‘file name’ as an input and uses a regular expression to extract the country, date and file extension.\n\nNow let’s write a test for this function.\n\nWe can write a single test for the function as follows:\n\nThis is fine, however, it only tests a for a single test case. To be more thorough, we should test multiple different filenames and verify they all give the expected output.\n\nThis is where the function decorator comes in handy. It lets us create multiple test cases without having to write multiple test functions.\n\nWithout using fixtures, we could directly pass two example filenames and their expected outputs to a parametrized test as follows:\n\nPassing in the filenames manually like this works fine for a small single test. However, what if we want to re-use those filenames across many other tests.\n\nTo re-use the filename values across multiple tests would require the use of pytest fixtures .\n\nFor example we could write the following fixtures. This would allow us to define the filenames once and use across multiple tests.\n\nDirectly using fixtures as arguments in pytest parametrize ❌#\n\nSo how do we use these fixtures in a parametrized test function?\n\nNaively, one might try and pass the fixture directly as an argument to the parametrize inputs – after all, that is what you would do when using a fixture in a normal test function.\n\nBut this will give a :\n\nPytest parametrize error using fixtures directly in the test function\n\nThe solution is to use a work around. We should pass the fixture name as a string to our parametrized test inputs and then request the value of the fixture within the test.\n\nTo do this we can use an built-in pytest fixture called request .\n\nPytest comes with a number of useful fixtures which you can access by passing their name to your test function. Exactly how you would with your own custom fixtures.\n\nThe fixture has a method called . This method allows you to request the value of a fixture by its name. Just pass the name of the fixture as a string to the function to get the value.\n\nTherefore, we can modify the example to use our custom fixture by:\n• passing the custom fixture name as a string to\n• adding a line of code to request the value of the specified fixture when running the test\n\nThat’s it! You can now use your fixtures in parametrized tests using pytest.\n\nIt is pretty annoying that there is not a more intuitive way to pass fixtures to parametrized tests. But luckily there is a relatively simple workaround which does not need third party libraries.\n\nHopefully, native use of fixtures in parametrized tests will be added in a future pytest release, although it has been almost 10 years since the feature was first requested… so I’m not holding my breath😢\n• How to Always Enable Autoreloading of Modules in iPython\n• Five Tips to Elevate the Readability of your Python Code\n• Do Programmers Need to be able to Type Fast?\n• How to Manage Multiple Git Accounts on the Same Machine"

        "document": "While writing your Selenium automation scripts, you’d often require data that you want to share across multiple tests. This is done by using objects which are used to instantiate the particular dataset. In pytest, this can be easily done with the help of fixtures.\n\nConsider a test scenario where MySQL queries are executed on a database. The execution time here depends on the size of the database and the operations can be highly CPU intensive depending on its size.\n\nIn such cases, repetitive implementation and execution are avoided by using pytest fixtures as they feed data to the tests such as DB connections. They also help to instantiate Selenium WebDriver for browsers under test, URLs to test, etc.\n\nIn this blog, we look at pytest fixtures and why you should use it for Python automation testing.\n\npytest fixtures are functions attached to the tests which run before the test function is executed. Fixtures are a set of resources that have to be set up before and cleaned up once the Selenium test automation execution is completed.\n\nThe pytest fixture function is automatically called by the pytest framework when the name of the argument and the fixture is the same.\n\nA function is marked as fixture using the following marker:\n\nShown below is a sample pytest fixture function for this Selenium Python tutorial:\n\nIn the sample code shown above, the fixture function is fixture_func() method. It is called when the test_fixture() function is invoked for execution. The return value of the fixture function is passed as an argument to test_fixture(). Assert is raised if the value returned by fixture_func() does not match the expected output.\n\nThe scope of a fixture function indicates the number of times a fixture function is invoked. Here are the detailed description of the pytest fixtures scope in this Selenium Python tutorial:\n• Function: This is the default value of the fixture scope. Fixture with function scope is executed once per session.\n• Package (or Session): A pytest fixture with scope as Session is created only once for the entire Selenium test automation session. Session scope is ideal for usage as WebDriver handles are available for the Selenium test automation session.\n• Module: As the name indicates, a fixture function with scope as Module is created (or invoked) only once per module.\n• Class: The fixture function is created once per class object.\n\nThe scope of pytest fixture function can be supplied with the @pytest.fixture marker.\n\nAs of now, the latest versions of Python and pytest are 3.13.2 and 8.3.4, respectively. However, this blog uses Python 3.6.6 and pytest 5.4.1.\n\nIn automated browser testing with Selenium, the web browser has to be loaded before the Selenium test automation is performed. Loading the browser before every test is not a good practice.\n\nRather, the web browser should be loaded once before the tests have started and closed once the tests are complete. pytest fixtures are extremely useful when you are performing automated browser testing.\n\nCommon Selenium WebDriver implementation can be a part of the fixture function, particularly – initialization of the Selenium WebDriver for browser under test & cleanup of resources after the completion of tests.\n\nFor demonstrating automated browser testing with pytest fixtures and Selenium WebDriver, I’ll consider the Selenium test automation scenarios mentioned below in this Selenium Python tutorial:\n• Select the first two checkboxes.\n• Send ‘Happy Testing at LambdaTest’ to the textbox with id = sampletodotext.\n• Click the Add Button and verify whether the text has been added or not.\n• Navigate to the official website of Google.\n• Click on the first test result.\n• Raise an Assert if the page title does not match the expected title.\n\nAs there are two different Selenium test automation cases, we would need two pytest fixtures functions for initialization and de-initialization of resources for Chrome and Firefox browser respectively.\n\nAll the necessary modules for this Selenium Python tutorial example are imported at the beginning of the implementation. Two pytest fixtures functions are created, one for each Selenium test automation case as different browsers are used for testing.\n\nThe chrome_driver_init() function is decorated with the @pytest.fixture indicating that it will be used as a fixture function. The scope of the fixture is set to class.\n\nThe request.cls will be set to None for a scope that is not of type class. Since the scope of the pytest fixtures function is set to class, request.cls is nothing but the test class that is using the function. For the test Test_URL_Chrome(), request.cls.driver will be the same as Test_URL_Chrome.driver which is the reference to the Chrome WebDriver instance.\n\nThe code after yield is run as a finalizer. Once the test is executed, the Selenium WebDriver is shut down using the close method of Selenium test automation.\n\nThe implementation for the other fixture function i.e. driver_init() is the same, except that the browser being used is Firefox.\n\nTo ensure that the WebDriver is initialized only once, the fixtures are applied to the respective base classes i.e. BaseTest() and Basic_Chrome_Test(). The test classes would be extended from the respective base class.\n\nThe fixture functions [driver_init() and chrome_driver_init()] are passed as arguments to the corresponding test functions. Test_URL is the test class that is extended from the base class BasicTest.\n\nTest_URL_Chrome is the test class that is extended from the base class Basic_Chrome_Test. Both classes contain a single test. The tests locate the required web elements on the web page.\n\nOnce located, appropriate Selenium methods [find_element_by_name(), find_element_by_id()] and necessary operations [i.e. click(), submit(), send_keys(), etc.] are performed on those elements. As this part of the Selenium Python tutorial focuses on pytest fixtures, we would not get into the minute details of the Selenium test automation implementation.\n\nThe following command is used for executing Selenium test automation:\n\nShown below in this Selenium Python tutorial is the execution snapshot which indicates that both the tests executed successfully.\n\nWhat if you need to execute the same tests on different web browsers e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Opera, etc., with separate pytest fixtures functions that instantiate the Selenium WebDriver for the required web browser.\n\nIt is recommended to have a single fixture function that can be executed across different input values. This can be achieved via parameterized pytest fixtures, which I’ll show next in this Selenium Python tutorial.\n\nParameterized driver_init fixture that takes input as Chrome and Firefox are below:\n\nDeclaration of params with @pytest.fixture contains a list of values (i.e. Chrome, Firefox) for each of which the fixture function will be executed. The value can be accessed using request.param function. Porting the code from a normal (i.e. non-parameterized) fixture to a parameterized fixture does not require any change in the feature implementation.\n\nTo demonstrate parameterized pytest features, I would execute the following test cases on Chrome and Firefox browsers:\n• Select the first two checkboxes.\n• Send ‘Happy Testing at LambdaTest’ to the textbox with id = sampletodotext.\n• Click the Add Button and verify whether the text has been added or not.\n\nAs the Selenium test automation needs to be executed on Chrome and Firefox browsers, we first create a parameterized fixture function that takes these as arguments. Depending on the browser being used for testing, an appropriate WebDriver instance for the browser is initiated i.e. if the param value is chrome, WebDriver for Chrome browser is initialized.\n\nAs shown below in this Selenium Python tutorial, request.param is used to read the value from the fixture function. The remaining implementation of the Fixture function remains the same as a non-parameterized fixture function.\n\nAs shown below in this Selenium Python tutorial, request.param is used to read the value from the pytest fixtures function. The remaining implementation of the Fixture function remains the same as a non-parameterized fixture function.\n\nRest of the implementation remains the same as Test Case (1) which is demonstrated in the section Automated Browser Testing using Selenium & pytest Fixtures. The only change is that we have used a parameterized fixture function to execute the test on Chrome and Firefox browsers.\n\nShown below is the Selenium test automation execution on the browsers under test:\n\nAs seen in the terminal snapshot, the test code test_open_url() is invoked separately for input values chrome and firefox.\n\nAlong with parameterized test fixtures, pytest also provides decorators using which you can parameterize test functions. The @pytest.mark.parametrize decorator enables the parameterization of arguments for a test function. Using this decorator, you can use a data-driven approach to testing as Selenium test automation can be executed across different input combinations.\n\nHere is how @pytest.mark.parametrize decorator can be used to pass input values:\n\nAs shown in the official documentation of parameterization in pytest, the expected output can also be supplied along with the input parameters.\n\nIn this pytest tutorial, learn how to use parameterization in pytest to write concise and maintainable test cases by running the same test code with multiple data sets.\n\nTo demonstrate parameterization in test functions, we perform Selenium test automation where separate web pages are opened for Chrome and Firefox browsers. Assert is raised if the page title does not match the expected title.\n\nAs shown in the implementation above for this Selenium Python tutorial, two input arguments of type string (test_browser and test_url) are supplied to the @pytest.mark.parametrize decorator. The input values are separated by comma (,) and enclosed under [].\n\nThe test function uses the input arguments added via the decorator for performing the Selenium test automation.\n\nThe rest of the implementation is self-explanatory and we would not get into details of the same. Shown below in this Selenium Python tutorial is the execution snapshot which indicates that Selenium test automation was executed across both the input combinations.\n\nThere might be cases where pytest fixtures have to be shared across different tests. Sharing of pytest fixtures can be achieved by adding the pytest fixtures functions to be exposed in conftest.py. It is a good practice to keep conftest.py in the root folder from where the Selenium test automation execution is performed.\n\nShown below is conftest.py where parameterized fixture function driver_init() is added.\n\nAs driver_init() fixture function is now a part of conftest.py, the implementation of fixture function is removed from the test code and @pytest.mark.usefixtures decorator with input as fixture function is added in the test file.\n\nBelow is the snippet of the implementation in the test file:\n\nRest of the implementation remains the same as the one demonstrated in the section Parameterized pytest Fixtures. As seen from the code snippet, the fixture implementation is no longer a part of the test code as it is now shifted to conftest.py. We do not import conftest.py in the test code as the pytest framework automatically checks its presence in the root directory when compilation is performed.\n\nThere are cases where a test might not be relevant for a particular platform or browser. Rather than executing the Selenium test automation case for that platform and expecting it to fail, it would be better if the test is skipped with a valid reason.\n\nA skip in pytest means that the test is expected to pass only on if certain conditions are met. Common cases are executing certain cross browser tests on the latest browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, etc. and skipping on Internet Explorer with a reason.\n\nA xfail means that the test is expected to fail due to some reason. A common example is a test for a feature that is yet to be implemented. If the test marked as xfail still happens to pass, it is marked as xpass (and not pass).\n\nxfail tests are indicated using the following marker:\n\nTests can be skipped for execution using the following marker:\n\nTests that skip, xpass, or xfail are reported separately in the test summary. Detailed information about skipped/xfailed tests is not available by default in the summary and can be enabled using the –r option\n\nA test function that has to be skipped for execution can be marked using the skip decorator along with an optional reason for skipping the test.\n\nFor conditional skip, the @pytest.mark.skipif marker can be used to skip the function if a condition is True. In the example shown below for this Selenium Python tutorial, test_function() will not be executed (i.e. skipped) if the Python version is less than 3.8.\n\nThe xfail marker is used to mark a test function that is expected to fail.\n\nIf a test fails only under a certain condition, the test can be marked as xfail with a condition and an optional reason that is printed alongside the xfailed test.\n\nxfail and skip markers can also be used along with fixtures in pytest. The respective markers can be supplied along with the parameters in a parameterized fixture.\n\nTo demonstrate the usage of xfail and skip markers with parameterized fixtures, we take sample test cases which are executed on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari browsers. As seen in the snippet above:\n• Test on Firefox is marked as xfail.\n• Test on Chrome is a regular test and marked with a marker pytest.mark.basic.\n• Test on Safari is marked as skip hence, it will not be executed.\n\nThe test case to be executed on Firefox is marked as xfail but the test case passes. Hence, the final status of the test on Firefox is xpass. Test on Chrome browser is marked with a marker pytest.mark.basic. It executes successfully and hence the status is pass.\n\nThe final test is on Safari browser and is marked with the skip marker. Hence, it is skipped for execution.\n\nShown below in this Selenium Python tutorial is the execution snapshot:\n\nWe use the earlier example to demonstrate usage of xfail and skip markers, with the markers applied on the individual test cases.\n\nThe test cases test_chrome_url() and test_firefox_url() are marked as xfail but they execute successfully. Hence, the result for these test cases is xpass. On the other hand, the final test test_safari_url() is marked with pytest.mark.skip marker and hence, will be skipped from execution.\n\nShown below is the execution snapshot:\n\nTo further enhance your Python testing with pytest fixtures, you can consider using cloud-based testing platforms such as LambdaTest.\n\nIt is an AI-powered test execution platform that lets you perform automation testing with pytest on real browsers, ensuring comprehensive test coverage and eliminating the hassle of local environment configuration. You can leverage its cloud grid capabilities to execute tests in parallel, significantly reducing test execution time and improving overall test efficiency.\n\npytest fixtures are functions that are run before each function to which it is applied is executed. Fixtures can be used for simple unit testing as well as testing for complex scenarios. pytest fixtures are ideal for usage in cross browser testing as browser resources need not be instantiated every time when a test is executed.\n\nFunction, module, class, and session are the different scopes available with fixture functions. pytest Fixtures, as well as test functions, can be parameterized. conftest.py is used to share fixtures across tests.\n\nFeel free to retweet and share this article with your peers!
