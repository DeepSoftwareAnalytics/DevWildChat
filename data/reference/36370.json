For information about installing DQS, see Install Data Quality Services.\n\nThe table in this section lists the minimum software requirements for running SQL Server. There are also recommended configuration options for optimal performance.\n\nThe following software requirements apply to all installations:\n\nSQL Server Setup installs the following software components required by the product:\n\nThe following table shows which editions of SQL Server 2017 are compatible with which versions of Windows:\n\nThe following editions of Windows server support installing SQL Server 2017 on Server Core mode:\n\nFor more information on installing SQL Server on Server Core, see Install SQL Server on Server Core.\n\nThe following table shows which editions of SQL Server 2016 are compatible with which versions of Windows:\n\nFor minimum version requirements to install SQL Server on Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows 8, see Installing SQL Server on Windows Server 2012 or Windows 8.\n\nThe following editions of Windows server support installing SQL Server 2016 on Server Core mode:\n\nFor more information on installing SQL Server on Server Core, see Install SQL Server on Server Core.\n\nWOW64 (Windows 32-bit on Windows 64-bit) is a feature of 64-bit editions of Windows that enables 32-bit applications to run natively in 32-bit mode. Applications function in 32-bit mode, even though the underlying operating system is a 64-bit operating system. WOW64 is not supported for SQL Server installations. However, Management Tools are supported in WOW64.\n\nWindows client operating systems, for example Windows 10 and Windows 8.1 are available as 32-bit or 64-bit architectures. All SQL Server features are supported on 64-bit client operating systems. On supported 32-bit client operating systems Microsoft supports the following features:\n\nWindows Server 2008 R2 and later server operating systems are not available as 32-bit architectures. All supported server operating systems are only available as 64-bit. All features are supported on 64-bit server operating systems.\n\nFor more information about cross-language support and considerations for installing SQL Server in localized languages, see Local Language Versions in SQL Server.\n\nDuring installation of SQL Server, Windows Installer creates temporary files on the system drive. Before you run Setup to install or upgrade SQL Server, verify that you have at least 6.0 GB of available disk space on the system drive for these files. This requirement applies even if you install SQL Server components to a non-default drive.\n\nActual hard disk space requirements depend on your system configuration and the features that you decide to install. The following table provides disk space requirements for SQL Server components.\n\n*The disk space requirement for downloaded Books Online content is 200 MB.\n\nThe supported storage types for data files are:\n• Local Disk\n• SQL Server currently supports disk drives that have standard native sector sizes of 512 bytes and 4 KB. Hard disks with sector sizes larger than 4 KB can cause errors when attempting to store SQL Server data files on them. See Troubleshoot errors related to system disk sector size greater than 4 KB for more information on hard disk sector-size support in SQL Server. Currently, the registry key is required to successfully install SQL Server on some newer storage devices with system disk sector size greater than 4 KB.\n• SQL Server failover cluster installation supports Local Disk only for installing the files. Ensure that the path specified for the tempdb data and log files is valid on all the cluster nodes. During failover, if the tempdb directories are not available on the failover target node, the SQL Server resource fails to come online.\n• SMB File Share\n• SMB storage is not supported for Analysis Services data files for either standalone or clustered installations. Use direct attached storage, a storage area network, or S2D instead.\n• SMB storage can be hosted by a Windows File Server or a third-party SMB storage device. If Windows File Server is used, the Windows File Server version should be 2008 or later. For more information about installing SQL Server using SMB file share as a storage option, see Install SQL Server with SMB Fileshare as a Storage Option.\n\nFor security reasons, we recommend that you do not install SQL Server on a domain controller. SQL Server Setup doesn't block installation on a computer that is a domain controller, but the following limitations apply:\n• None You cannot run SQL Server services on a domain controller under a local service account.\n• None After SQL Server is installed on a computer, you cannot change the computer from a domain member to a domain controller. You must uninstall SQL Server before you change the host computer to a domain controller.\n• None After SQL Server is installed on a computer, you cannot change the computer from a domain controller to a domain member. You must uninstall SQL Server before you change the host computer to a domain member.\n• None SQL Server failover cluster instances are not supported where cluster nodes are domain controllers.\n• None SQL Server is not supported on a read-only domain controller. SQL Server Setup cannot create security groups or provision SQL Server service accounts on a read-only domain controller. In this scenario, Setup fails. This restriction also applies to installations on domain member nodes.\n• None A SQL Server failover cluster instance is not supported in an environment where only a read-only domain controller is accessible. This restriction also applies to installations on domain member nodes.\n\nYou can get relevant installation media from the following locations:\n\nAlternatively, you can create an Azure virtual machine already running SQL Server."

        "document": "The new SQL Server 2017 comes with new features in the installation. It now supports Machine Learning Services that support R and Python. It also includes SSIS Scale Out Master and Scale Out Worker. It also includes scale out options in PolyBase.\n\nIn this article, we will explain how to install SQL Server step by step.\n\nYou can download the SQL Server 2017 installer here.\n\nYou have 3 main options. The trial evaluation, Developer edition and Express edition.\n\nThe main question is which SQL Server edition should I use?\n• The SQL Server trial evaluation is the free edition that includes all the features. If you want to check out any/all of the features, this is a complete version. It is a 180 days trial, but you can buy an Enterprise or Standard license later. Use this version if you plan to buy a license later.\n• SQL Server Developer edition is free, but you cannot use it in production. For this tutorial, you can use any of them. I recommend this one if you use it for development purposes or for training purposes. It includes all the features also.\n• The SQL Server Express edition is free and can be used in production, but it has a limitation in Storage (10 GB) and it does not include several features (SQL Server Agent, DTA, etc.). I recommend this edition if you do not have too much disk space or resources in your machine.\n\nThere are other editions like the SQL Server Standard and Web edition. They are cheaper versions than the enterprise. The Web edition contains the features necessary to work in a Web hosting environment. The Standard edition is like the Enterprise edition, but it has some limitations like the Transparent Data Encryption, Partition Table parallelism, mirrored backups, online indexing, etc. I recommend checking the features that are not included in this edition to check if it is a good idea to buy them to save money.\n\nFor a complete list of differences between SQL Server versions, refer to this link.\n\nOnce downloaded, run the setup file of the SQL Server installer. The Basic option will install mainly the Database Engine with basic components. We will use the Custom option to learn some other features included in SQL Server. Download Media is used to install later or to install in other machines:\n\nYou can choose the installation location. It requires 9,000 MB of free space. Once selected, press Install:\n\nWhile installing, you will find useful URLs. For example, the following SQL Server forums. You will receive good advice here:\n\nAlso, it will show the GitHub which contains sample databases, code samples and more.\n\nThe installer will install in the Planning section. There are many nice resources here like the Hardware and Software requirements to verify if you have all the hardware and software requirements. You also have security documentation, System Configuration Checker, the Data Migration Assistant (DMA), Online installation documentation, Failover and Upgrading documentation:\n\nWe will go to the Installation section and select the option New SQL Server stand-alone installation. Note that SQL Server Reporting Services is installed separately:\n\nIn product key, you can specify a license or select a free edition. In this example, we will install the developer edition:\n\nLicense Terms will show the terms to install it. Accept the license terms:\n\nIn Microsoft updates, you can verify if there are updates in the installer:\n\nThe Install Rules will verify the Active Template Library, the registry keys and if the computer is not a domain controller:\n\nIn the context of the Feature Selection, Data Engine Services is the database itself.\n• Replication is useful if you want to replicate your data in another server or another SQL Server instance.\n• Machine Learning Services (In-Database). You can install R or Python. SQL Server 2016 included the R Services. Now, you can have R and/or Python.\n• Full-Text and Semantic Extractions for Search used for full-text queries.\n• Data Quality Services is used to enrich, standardize and avoid duplicate data.\n• Another nice feature is PolyBase used to query NoSQL Data.\n• Analysis Services is used in Business Intelligence (BI) to generate cubes to create Enterprise Reports with a multi-dimensional technology:\n\nYou have Machine Learning Services (In-Database) and Standalone. The first option is to install the SQL Server Database Engine. The Standalone does not require a database engine.\n\nData Quality Client is to perform quality operations using standalone tools. In Integration Services we have the option to install Scale Out Master and Scale Out Worker. With this feature you can distribute the packages in different Servers to provide better performance. The master is the responsible for the operations and the Workers receive the tasks. Client tools backward compatibility includes tools to work with earlier SQL Server versions like deprecated tools, discontinued tools and breaking changes in SQL tools.\n\nDistributed Replay Controller is the feature in charge to administer the distributed Replay clients. The Distribution Replay is used to capture a trace, verify performance, security, for upgrades or test environments it is like the SQL Profiler, but distributed Replay can trace multiple servers.\n\nYou can install the Distributed Replay client to simulate workloads.\n\nSQL Client Connectivity SDK will install SQL Server OLEBD and ODBC connectors that can be used to connect to SQL Server using.NET, Java, PHP or other programming languages.\n\nFinally, the Master Data Services are used to organize your data into models, creates rules for the access to the data and control who is using it:\n\nIf you select to install PolyBase, the setup will ask for the Oracle JRE. You can obtain the JRE installer in the following link.\n\nYou can have multiple SQL Server instances in SQL Server in the same server. This can be useful to simulate and practice replications, mirroring or to have separate instances for different purposes. By default, you can install the default instance that is usually the Server computer name:\n\nIn PolyBase you can now install as a standalone instance or using a PolyBase scale-out group. The Scale-out group is used when you need to query massive data and you need to distribute the job across multiple SQL Server instances. This option requires to enable ports and enable the MSDTC:\n\nThere are account names created automatically for each service. It is a good practice to keep them. Do not grant administrative privileges to these accounts unless there is no other choice:\n\nThere are two options in SQL Server to authenticate. Windows authentication will use the Windows Account to authenticate in SQL. Mixed Mode allows creating internal logins and passwords inside SQL Server. You can Add accounts here using the Add Current User or by pressing the Add button:\n\nIn the Data Directories tab, you can choose the location of your data file and log file. It is a good practice to have them in separated drives to improve performance and increase security for disaster recovery.\n\nFor more information. Refer to this link.\n\nThe TempDB tab is used to configure the TempDB database. This is a system table used to store temporary data. Check our article to improve your database performance by configuring this database correctly:\n\nFILESTREAM allows to store non-structured data like documents, images in the database:\n\nThe Analysis Services Configuration allows installing a Multidimensional and Data Mining Mode. This is a multidimensional cube that allows creating fast queries for enterprise reports. Another option is to Install Tabular Mode. The Tabular databases are dependent on the RAM. If your database will have several TB of information, the Multidimensional option is better. If you require Data Mining services, the Multidimensional option is better. For more information about Multidimensional vs Tabular Models, refer to this link.\n\nPowerPivot can be used in Excel or if you can use it in SharePoint. PowerPivot for Excel can be used to create your reports. If you need to share with multiple people you can use SharePoint. You can add users with administrative permissions:\n\nIntegration Scale-Out Configuration – Master Mode will be used to define the port to communicate between the master and worker nodes. You will also be able to create the certificate here or use an existing one:\n\nIn the Integration Services Scale Out Configuration – Worker Node, you need to specify the endpoint of the Master Node, which is the master node name and the port. You can also specify the SSL certificate here:\n\nYou will receive a question if you want to install R. Press Accept and then next. R is a very popular language used for machine learning and other uses:\n\nYou can also accept to install Python which is a competes with R and offers many useful capabilities\n\nOnce that you have everything installed, you can verify the configurations. If everything is OK, press Install:\n\nAfter 15-45 min, you will have your database installed:\n\nOnce installed the database and other components, open the installer. In the Installation section select the option to Install the SQL Server Management Tools:\n\nIt will go to the SSMS web page, download the product:\n\nIn the Windows menu, open the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio:\n\nSelect the SQL Server name and press Connect:\n\nSelect a database. Right click and select New Query:\n\nWe will run a system stored procedure. The sp_who that will show the sessions, users connected and processes:\n\nAnother tool that is installed separately is the SQL Server Data Tools. This tool will help you if you want to work with BI tools like SSAS, SSIS or SSRS:\n\nThe link will go to the SSDT web page you can download the last version here:\n\nSQL Server 2017 comes with many new features like the Python support, SSIS Master Scale Out, worker nodes.

        "document": "The article lists the minimum hardware and software requirements to install and run SQL Server 2016 and SQL Server 2017 on the Windows operating system.\n\nFor hardware and software requirements for other versions of SQL Server, see:\n\nThe following hardware requirements apply to SQL Server 2016 and SQL Server 2017:\n\n* The minimum memory required for installing the Data Quality Server component in Data Quality Services (DQS) is 2 GB of RAM, which is different from the SQL Server minimum memory requirement. For information about installing DQS, see Install Data Quality Services.\n\nThe table in this section lists the minimum software requirements for running SQL Server. There are also recommended configuration options for optimal performance.\n\nThe following software requirements apply to all installations:\n\nSQL Server Setup installs the following software components required by the product:\n\nThe following table shows which editions of SQL Server 2017 are compatible with which versions of Windows:\n\nThe following editions of Windows server support installing SQL Server 2017 on Server Core mode:\n\nFor more information on installing SQL Server on Server Core, see Install SQL Server on Server Core.\n\nThe following table shows which editions of SQL Server 2016 are compatible with which versions of Windows:\n\nFor minimum version requirements to install SQL Server on Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows 8, see Installing SQL Server on Windows Server 2012 or Windows 8.\n\nThe following editions of Windows server support installing SQL Server 2016 on Server Core mode:\n\nFor more information on installing SQL Server on Server Core, see Install SQL Server on Server Core.\n\nWOW64 (Windows 32-bit on Windows 64-bit) is a feature of 64-bit editions of Windows that enables 32-bit applications to run natively in 32-bit mode. Applications function in 32-bit mode, even though the underlying operating system is a 64-bit operating system. WOW64 is not supported for SQL Server installations. However, Management Tools are supported in WOW64.\n\nWindows client operating systems, for example Windows 10 and Windows 8.1 are available as 32-bit or 64-bit architectures. All SQL Server features are supported on 64-bit client operating systems. On supported 32-bit client operating systems Microsoft supports the following features:\n\nWindows Server 2008 R2 and later server operating systems are not available as 32-bit architectures. All supported server operating systems are only available as 64-bit. All features are supported on 64-bit server operating systems.\n\nFor more information about cross-language support and considerations for installing SQL Server in localized languages, see Local Language Versions in SQL Server.\n\nDuring installation of SQL Server, Windows Installer creates temporary files on the system drive. Before you run Setup to install or upgrade SQL Server, verify that you have at least 6.0 GB of available disk space on the system drive for these files. This requirement applies even if you install SQL Server components to a non-default drive.\n\nActual hard disk space requirements depend on your system configuration and the features that you decide to install. The following table provides disk space requirements for SQL Server components.\n\n*The disk space requirement for downloaded Books Online content is 200 MB.\n\nThe supported storage types for data files are:\n• Local Disk\n• SQL Server currently supports disk drives that have standard native sector sizes of 512 bytes and 4 KB. Hard disks with sector sizes larger than 4 KB can cause errors when attempting to store SQL Server data files on them. See Troubleshoot errors related to system disk sector size greater than 4 KB for more information on hard disk sector-size support in SQL Server. Currently, the registry key is required to successfully install SQL Server on some newer storage devices with system disk sector size greater than 4 KB.\n• SQL Server failover cluster installation supports Local Disk only for installing the files. Ensure that the path specified for the tempdb data and log files is valid on all the cluster nodes. During failover, if the tempdb directories are not available on the failover target node, the SQL Server resource fails to come online.\n• SMB File Share\n• SMB storage is not supported for Analysis Services data files for either standalone or clustered installations. Use direct attached storage, a storage area network, or S2D instead.\n• SMB storage can be hosted by a Windows File Server or a third-party SMB storage device. If Windows File Server is used, the Windows File Server version should be 2008 or later. For more information about installing SQL Server using SMB file share as a storage option, see Install SQL Server with SMB Fileshare as a Storage Option.\n\nFor security reasons, we recommend that you do not install SQL Server on a domain controller. SQL Server Setup doesn't block installation on a computer that is a domain controller, but the following limitations apply:\n• None You cannot run SQL Server services on a domain controller under a local service account.\n• None After SQL Server is installed on a computer, you cannot change the computer from a domain member to a domain controller. You must uninstall SQL Server before you change the host computer to a domain controller.\n• None After SQL Server is installed on a computer, you cannot change the computer from a domain controller to a domain member. You must uninstall SQL Server before you change the host computer to a domain member.\n• None SQL Server failover cluster instances are not supported where cluster nodes are domain controllers.\n• None SQL Server is not supported on a read-only domain controller. SQL Server Setup cannot create security groups or provision SQL Server service accounts on a read-only domain controller. In this scenario, Setup fails. This restriction also applies to installations on domain member nodes.\n• None A SQL Server failover cluster instance is not supported in an environment where only a read-only domain controller is accessible. This restriction also applies to installations on domain member nodes.\n\nYou can get relevant installation media from the following locations:\n\nAlternatively, you can create an Azure virtual machine already running SQL Server."
