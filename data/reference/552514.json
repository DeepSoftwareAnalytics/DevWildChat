        "document": "A pleasant day steemians ! Here I am again to do tutorials in algebra which is the laws of signed numbers. This topic is just so easy and I don't believe that you will not learn in this tutorial. So come on steemians, read and learn in this tutorials.\n\nThis are the following topics that I will discuss and I will also give a two or more samples in every topic.\n\nThese are the five topics I will going to discuss but first, what is signed numbers ? Then where this numbers can be used ? So here's the answer for this two questions.\n\n= it is a number with a plus sign (+) which is to indicate a positive quantity or by a minus sign (-) to indicate a negative quantity. There are two types of signed numbers. The positive number and the negative number.\n• Positive number = it is numbers greater than zero which is in the right side or the numbers with a positive sign (+). The positive numbers with no sign of (+) is also consider a positive number.\n• Negative number = the numbers that are less than zero which is in the left side of the picture or the numbers with a negative sing (-). The negative numbers is always has a negative sign (-) unlike in the positive numbers can be without a positive sign (+).\n\n\n\n Image source\n\n In arithmetic you can't subtract smaller number togreeater number or you can't subtract if the first number is greater than the second number. Just like in the photo above. The zero subtract to one but in able to get the answer they will the borrowing method. But here in algebra we can do the subtracting even if the first number is smaller than the second number. We have four operations in doing the calculations and each operation has a different rules. We will start with the first now.\n• None To add two numbers having like signs or the same signs (+ and + or - and -), find the sum of their absolute value (values of a number regardless of the sign) and the prefix the common sign.\n• None To add numbers having unlike signs or different signs (+ and - or - and +), find the difference of their absolute values and prefix the sign of the number with greater absolute values.\n\nYou will look their signs and if their the same you will just copy the sign to the result of their sum. So their signs are negative (-).\n\nYou will add the two values which is the 8 and 5 and their result is 13.\n\nSo the answer is negative 13 (-13).\n\n -8 + (-5) = -13\n\nLook at their signs and in this case the signs are unlike or different (- and +) so you will find which number is the greater value and what sign of that greater number has. The greater number of this problem is 26 and it is a negative sign (-) so the result of their sum must be negative sign (-) but if the greater number is positive the result of their sum is also positive.\n\nYou will find their difference because they are unlike signs (26 -8) so their difference is18.\n\nSo the result of their sum is negative 18 (-18).\n\n -26 + 8 = -18\n• To subtract one number from another, first change the sign of the number being subtracted and then add. If a and b is a real number, then\n\n a - b = a + (-b) or a + b = a - (-b)\n\nYou will look at first their signs and in this case it is look like the rule that if a - (-b) it is equal to a + b so it will be like this now 8 + 2.\n\nYou will add now the the two real numbers because it is addition now because of the rule if a - (-b) = a + b.\n\nThe result of this problem is positive 10 (+10 or 10).\n\n 8 - (-2) = 8 + 2 = 10\n\nYou will look first what kind of rule you are going to use and in this problem it is like the rule that if a + (-b) is equal to a - b. Don't mind the sign of the first number and just don't change the sign of the first number even if it is positive (+) or negative (-). So this problem will become -6 - 3.\n\nThe two numbers has a like signs or the same signs so in this case we will use the rule of addition which is if it is like signs you will add the two numbers and copy their sign to the result of their sum.\n\nThe result of this problem now is negative 9 (-9).\n\n -6 + (-3) = -9\n\nSo in this problem we already picture out what kind of rule we were goig to use and it is the a + (-b) = a - b. This problem will be like this now 3 - 1.5 .\n\nTheir signs are unlike so we know in the rule of addition, we will find the difference of the two numbers if they are unlike signs. Then in the rule of addition you will find what is the sign of the greater number and in this problem the greater number is 3 and its sign is positive (+). So the result of their difference will be also a positive sign.\n\nThe result of their difference is positive 1.5 .\n\n 3 + (-1.5) = 1.5\n• None To find the product of two signed numbers, multiply their absolute values. If the numbers have like signs, the product is positive. If they have unlike signs or different signs, the product is negative.\n• None To know that the operation to use is multiplication, it must be like this \"(a)(b)\" or \"a * b\". The sign like this \"x\" in multiplication is only in arithmetic because here in algebra the x represents as variable.\n• None Just follow this rule. If (-)(-) = + , (+)(+) = + , (-)(+) = - , (+)(-) = - .\n\nYou will look first if the signs are like or the same and in this case the signs are the same so the result of this problem or the product of this problem will be positive (+) because they have like signs. If the signs of the two numbers are different or unlike, the answer or the product will be negative (-) because they are unlike. In our 1st problem the product will be positive (+) because they are like signs.\n\nYou will multiply the two numbers and you will get the product.\n\nThe product of this problem is positive 72.\n\n (-8)(-9) = 72\n\nIn this problem there are three numbers, so 1st thing you will do is you must find the product of the first and second number because they need to be in order. The first and second number are like signs, so the product will be positive (+).\n\nThe product of the first and second number is positive 20 so the new problem now is \"(20)(-2)\" and as you can see their signs are unlike so if we will get the product of the this two number the result will be negative because unlike signs is negative.\n\nThe product and the final answer now is negative 40 (-40).\n\n (-4)(-5)(-2) = (20)(-2) = -40\n• None To find the quotient of two signed numbers, find the quotient of their absolute values. If the numbers have like signs, the quotient is positive. If they have unlike signs, the quotient is negative.\n• None Just follow this rule. If (-) ÷ (-) = + , (+) ÷ (+) = + , (-) ÷ (+) = - , (+) ÷ (-) = -.\n• None If the presentation is like this \"a / b\" or \"a ÷ b\" then we can say that it is a division.\n\nYou will going to divide the two numbers and their result is positive.\n\nThe quotient of this two number is positive 2.\n\n (-8) ÷ (-4) = 2\n\nThe two numbers has different signs so if they are unlike signs the quotient must be negative (-). So in this problem the quotient will be negative.\n\nDivide the two numbers and you will get the quotient of this problem.\n• None Carry out all operations within symbols of grouping, working from the innermost symbols outward.\n• None Carry out all multiplications and divisions, working from left to right.\n• None Carry out all multiplications and subtractions, working from left to right.\n• None Use the method PMDAS (Parenthesis, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction) which you will do the operation first inside the parenthesis then the next operation you will do is multiplication and followed by division and addition and the last is subtraction. But the division and addition can be interchange because it depends on the problem. The divisor and dividend must be a one number only in each of them to operate the division.\n\nWe will be going to solve a little tricky problem because we will use the four operations with the order of operations in one problem. So here we go let's solve and learn this kind of problem.\n\nWe will going to use the PMDAS method and the first operation we will do is inside the parentheses.\n\n 4(8 + 3) - 9 = 4(11) - 9\n\nWe will do now the next step in the method of PMDAS which is the multiplication. So in our problem 4(11) is multiplication and their signs are the same so their product will be positive.\n\n 4(11) - 9 = 44 - 9\n\nIn our new form of problem we can't see a division and addition because it is already subtraction \"44 - 9\". So we know in the subtraction, we will subtract the two numbers and find out the sign of the greater number. In our problem the sign of the greater number is positive so their difference will be positive (+). Then we will get our final answer positive 35.\n\n 4(8 + 3) - 9 = 4(11) -9 = 44 -9 = 35.\n\nWe will the PMDAS again and it's gonna be a little tricky because we will be using all methods. So the first is parentheses. We will do the operation first inside the parentheses which is the (-3 -2) and the (-5 + 2). In the first parentheses, their signs are like so we will add them and their signs is negative (-) then the result of their sum is negative. The 2nd parentheses are unlike sign so we will subtract them and the result of their difference is negative (-) the greater number has a negative sign.\n\n 5(-3 - 2) + (-5 + 2) / 2(-8) + 12 = 5(-5) + (-3) / 2(-8) + 12\n\nThe next operation is multiplication so we will multiply the following numbers, \"5(-5)\" and \"2(-8)\" so we know that in multiplication if they are unlike signs their product will be negative (-).\n\n -25 - 3 / -16 + 12\n\nActually the next operation is division but we can't divide this \"-25 - 3 / -16 + 12\" because the divisor and dividend are not one number in each so we must do the addition in \"-25 - 3\" and subtraction in \"-16 + 12\" first. So the the first two numbers are like sign so they are addition and their result is negative (-). Then in the second two numbers they are unlike sign so they are subtraction and their result is negative (-) because the sign of the greater number is negative.\n\n -28 / -4\n\nWe will do now the division because the divisor is already a one number and also in dividend. The final answer is positive 7 because they are like signs and as stated in the rule of division, if they are like sign the quotient will be positive.\n\n 5(-3 - 2) + (-5 + 2) / 2(-8) + 12\n\n = 5(-5) + (-3) / 2(-8) + 12\n\n = -25 - 3 / -16 + 12\n\n = -28 / -4\n\n = 7\n\nThat's all for my tutorials now I hope you enjoy reading this tutorial and I also hope you learn something from this tutorial. Thank you so much for taking time to read this blog and thank you so much to all steemians. Have a nice day and I hope you all doing great."

        "document": "Real Numbers are not just out of thin air, but have connections with real life. So, positive numbers like 2, 3, 89, 3/4 make sense immediately. But, what about negative numbers like -2, -4, -5, -100, -1/3? Watch the following video to understand these connections.\n\nNow that we understand from the above video where the signed numbers come from, let's visualize some operations like adding or subtracting of signed numbers. A number line is a very helpful tool.\n\nNotice when you are adding, no matter which number you start from, you move that many spots to the right. This is the basic understanding of the adding of signed numbers. Notice the right moving arrow. See more examples below."

        "document": "Positive real numbers can be represented by points on a number line from zero to the right of the zero. That is, whole numbers and positive rational and irrational numbers can be represented on a number line from zero to the right of zero.\n\nEvery positive number has a negative number known as its opposite, which lies to the left of zero on the number line. We use the negative sign ‘−’ to represent negative numbers and the positive sign ‘+’ to represent positive numbers. Zero, ‘0’, is neither positive nor negative.\n\nFor example, plotting the positive numbers [latex]\\displaystyle{\\frac{3}{4}}[/latex], 4, and 6.5 and their opposites on the number line:\n\nThe arrowhead on either end shows that the number line continues indefinitely in both the positive and negative directions.\n\nPositive and negative numbers are collectively called signed numbers. Since numbers are naturally positive, we usually omit the word ‘positive’ or the positive sign (+) when we read or write positive numbers. However, we must read or write the number as ‘negative’ or include the negative sign (−) when the number is negative. For example, ‘+7’ is read as ‘seven’ and written as ‘7’. However, ‘−7’ is read as ‘negative seven’ and written with the negative sign as ‘−7’.\n\nAny positive number and its negative (opposite) will equal zero (origin) on the number line.\n\nNumbers that lie to the left of a number on the number line are less than that number, and those that lie to the right on a number line are greater than that number.\n• −5 is less than −4, i.e., –5 < –4\n• −1 is less than 2, i.e., –1 < 2\n• The answer is always positive (+) when adding two positive numbers. For example, Adding +5 and +3: (+5) + (+3) = 5 + 3 = 8. This is the same as +8.\n• The answer is always negative when adding two negative numbers (−). For example,Adding −4 and −3: (−4) + (−3) = −4 − 3 = −7\n• When adding numbers with different signs, subtract the smaller absolute value (positive value) from, the larger absolute value (positive value), and keep the sign of the number with the larger absolute value. For example,\n• Adding +8 and −12 (or −12 and +8):(+8) + (−12) = 8 − 12 = −4\n• Adding −5 and +8 (or +8 and −5):(−5) + (+8) = −5 + 8 = 3 (or +3)\n• When subtracting negative numbers, change all the subtraction problems to addition problems by adding the opposite, and then follow the rules for adding signed numbers. For example,\n• The product of two numbers with the same sign is positive. For example,\n• The product of two numbers with different signs is negative. For example,\n• The quotient of two numbers with the same sign is positive. For example,\n• The quotient of two numbers with different signs is negative. For example,\n\nWhen multiplying or dividing more than two signed numbers, group them into pairs to determine the sign using the rules for multiplication and division of signed numbers.\n\nWhen a power has a negative base, there are four possible scenarios, as outlined in the following table:\n\nFrom the above scenarios, you will note:\n• A negative base with an even exponent produces a positive result (because pairs of negatives become positive).\n• A negative base with an odd exponent produces a negative result (because after negatives are paired, one negative will be left over).\n\nA negative base of a power expressed within a bracket, as in [latex](-a)^n[/latex], results in a different answer than a negative base expressed without a bracket, as in [latex]-a^n[/latex].\n\nIn [latex](-a)^n[/latex], the exponent applies to both the negative sign and [latex]a[/latex].\n\nIn [latex]-a^n[/latex], the exponent applies only to [latex]a[/latex] and the negative sign is applied to the answer.\n• In [latex]-5^4[/latex], only [latex]5[/latex] is multiplied [latex]4[/latex] times and the answer is negative; i.e., [latex]-5^4 = -[5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5] = -625[/latex]\n• In [latex]-5^3[/latex], only [latex]5[/latex] is multiplied [latex]3[/latex] times and the answer is negative; i.e., [latex]-5^3 = -[5 \\times 5 \\times 5] = -125[/latex]\n• When the index of the root is even, any positive number will have two real number solutions, with one being the negative of the other. The positive solution is known as its principal root.\n• For example, [latex]\\sqrt{9}[/latex] has two roots: +3 and –3, because (3) × (3) = 9 and (−3) × (−3) = 9 This is usually written as ±3 and read as “plus or minus 3”, and the principal root is 3.\n• [latex]\\sqrt[4]{16}[/latex] has two roots: +2 and –2, because (2) × (2) × (2) × (2) = 16 and (–2) × (–2) × (–2) × (–2) = 16 i.e., the roots are ±2 and the principal root is 2.\n• When the index of the root is odd, there is only one real number solution and it is positive. This positive solution is the principal root.\n• For example, [latex]\\sqrt[3]{27} = 3[/latex] because (3) × (3) × (3) = 27; i.e., the principal root is 3.\n• Similary, [latex]\\sqrt[5]{32} = 2[/latex] because (2) × (2) × (2) × (2) × (2) = 32; i.e., the principal root is 2.\n• When the index of the root is even, there is no real number solution to any negative number.\n• For example, [latex]\\sqrt[4]{-81}[/latex] has no real roots.\n• When the index of the root is odd, there is only one real number solution to any negative number and it is negative. This negative solution is the principal root.\n• For example, [latex]\\sqrt[5]{-32} = -2[/latex] because (−2) (−2) (−2) (−2) (−2) = −32; i.e., the principal root is –2.\n\nReal numbers include all positive numbers and negative numbers. A summary of the types of real numbers, which we have learned about in the last three chapters, is provided below:\n\nNote: Terminating decimals (decimals that end) and repeating decimals (decimals that do not end but show a repeating pattern) are also rational numbers because they can be expressed as a quotient of integers.\n• [latex]0.375[/latex] can be expressed as [latex]\\displaystyle{\\frac{3}{8}}[/latex].\n• [latex]0.185185...[/latex] is usually written as [latex]0.\\overline{185}[/latex] and can be expressed as [latex]\\displaystyle{\\frac{5}{27}}[/latex].\n\nAnswers to the odd-numbered problems are available at the end of the textbook.\n\nFor problems 1 to 6, place the correct sign ‘<’ or ‘>’ in the space between the following pairs of numbers indicated by the underscore.\n\nFor problems, 7 to 10, arrange the numbers from least to greatest."

        "document": "Real-life Applications of Negative Numbers: Negative numbers prove to be a vital component of mathematics, frequently appearing as an extension of natural numbers. They might seem scary because they go against what we usually think of as amounts. But, they're really useful in real life.\n\nIn this article, we will see how we use negative numbers in different ways every day, like in weather, money, and other areas, and will see the applications of negative numbers in real life.\n\nThe negative numbers are a representation of mathematical facts that are number which has value less than zero. They are similar to positive numbers in principle; however, they are represented by a minus (-) sign since a negative number necessarily follows it.\n\nNumerically, negative numbers represent several events occurring when the deficit, debt, or decreasing status from the reference point is experienced. Say, you owe money, have a temperature of low, and change movement in magnitude, and if you go in the opposite direction to the axis, then negative numbers come into action. Negative numbers have broad applications in different branches of science, starting from finance, and physics and ending with engineering, and daily activities as well.\n\nNegative numbers have major usage in finance when people want to talk about debts, losses, or expenses. For example, a deficit in the budget or debt incurred can be observed and represented by negative number symbols, implying the amount owed or decrease in financial resources, respectively. For example, thermodynamics considers occupied numbers to define temperature of three temperatures lesser than zero degrees Celsius or Kelvin. They have the chance here to do the measuring and calculating of the temperature changes precisely which occur in refrigerator processes or cryogenics. Negative numbers are used to indicate movement and position opposite to some reference point. In calculation, they are represented positively by removing the negative sign from their value. To illustrate, coordinate geometry or navigation would be represented by a negative coordinate as a direction to the left or below a certain origin. The negative numbers are the core of economic analysis in cases (when loss is the main outcome or reduction is the issue under discussion). They could be a display of the fact that the economy is declining in terms of GDP growth, stock prices, consumer spending, etc. Negative figures often serve as initial archetypes in physics, determining values of displacement, speed, and acceleration possible. The symbol which is negative in value represents the energy in the opposite direction related to some specific reference point, moreover, helps sense a lot of things in the world. In the electric engineering and topology, the negative numbers are used in order to indicate polarities, directions of the current flow and orientation of electromagnetic fields. The functionalities such as shit calculation and prediction in circuit analysis and electromagnetic systems are enabled by this.\"\n\nThere are so many real-life applications of negative numbers in various fields which are discussed below:\n• Real-life Applications of Negative Numbers in Elevations and Depths\n• Real-life Applications of Negative Numbers in Physics and Engineering\n• Real-life Applications of Negative Numbers in Electricity and Magnetism\n• Real-life Applications of Negative Numbers in Gaming and Sports\n• Negative numbers are used in temperature measurement to indicate a reading less than zero degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit.\n• Negative temperatures have applications in a variety of scientific fields, including cryogenics and materials, where the behavior of materials to extremely low temperatures is studied.\n• It is worth noting that negative temperatures are important in thermal engineering, as they contribute to the development and efficiency of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.\n• Negative numbers are often used in finance as indicators of losses, debts, or expenses.\n• These tabulations include cases where expenditure is higher than income or the value of assets depreciate.\n• Negative numbers play an important role in accounting to the extent of expressing liabilities (loans, mortgages and unpaid dues).\n• In investment analysis, negative numbers signify a decrease in the value of investments, stocks, or portfolios.\n• Negative financial indicators, such as negative cash flow or profit margins, alert businesses to potential financial challenges.\n• Finance professionals use negative numbers in budgeting and financial planning to anticipate and manage losses or downturns in revenue.\n\nReal-life Applications of Negative Numbers in Elevations and Depths\n• Negative numbers are employed in the field of geography, civil engineering, and oceanography to signify elevation or depth with reference to a sea level, as the basis for measurement.\n• The term lowlands refer to places above sea level, as well as regions either below the land or centered in water.\n• Offsets below the zero line signify depressions, bulks, or the ground levels below the surface, such as valleys, trenches and subsurface structures.\n• Engineers and architects are also sorely needed to precise align elevations when planning and designing the structures such as the tunnels, basements and underground facilities.\n• In financial dealing, the bank notes minus or displayed in red color produce withdrawals or negative cash flow.\n• A fiat money user, for example, performs a transaction via an ATM or by making a purchase with a debit card. The operation result will then appear as a negative number in the bank statement.\n• The other part of the negative numbers in bank transactions signify that the amount of fees is deducted from the account of the client like for instance charges for overdraft or service.\n• An accounting system tracks and maintains the running balance through the use of “negative numbers” to correctly show cash flow, balance accounts, and make the financial statements truthful.\n\nReal-life Applications of Negative Numbers in Physics and Engineering\n• Displacement: Indigenous values show negative values that mean the movement or position in the antiderived direction from a reference point, which is useful for analysis of displacement in the mechanics and kinematics.\n• Velocity: If there are negative velocities in the part of the equation representing the motion in the opposite direction to a chosen axis or in a specific frame of reference, this is crucial for calculating the speed in studies of fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, and classical mechanics.\n• Acceleration: Acceleration of a negative kind points to a deceleration of velocity long term, enabling engineers to perceive changes in speed and direction in a system such as an automobile, a rocket assembling or a machine.\n• Force: Newton's laws of motion show that negative forces are actual forces working in the opposite direction of the applied force, enabling engineers to predict the actions and control of objects whatever the conditions.\n• Electricity and Magnetism: Negative numbers are employed to specify polar direction, the direction current flows, and the orientation of magnetic fields in electric circuits, electric motors, generators, etc.\n• Thermodynamics: The study of extreme cold is enabled by creation of negative temperatures. This can be applied on cryogenics and refrigeration systems that allow researchers and engineers to manipulate material properties through which they control the thermal processes.\n• Growth and Decay: Negative numbers come into use when we would like to model the processes that are characterized by the decay, decline, or decrease in the amount of something over time, for example, radioactive decay, population decline, or the depreciation on the assets' value.\n• Economics: The negative signs are used to show different factors such as cost, loss, or deficit in the economic models, and this may aid in analyses of productions, consumption, investments, and financial transactions.\n• Logarithmic Functions: Negative numbers are used in logarithmic expressions to illustrate cases of the input varying from extremely high to extremely low values, e.g. in exponential growth and decay, and in pH.\n• Optimization Problems: While using negative numbers in solving optimization problems is primarily for denoting constrains, costs or penalties, this also helps to get the best solution in different engineering, logistics and resource allocation issues.\n• Differential Equations: In the context of differential equations, negative values show rates of growth, slopes, and other parameters like the gradient of various systems, such as population dynamics, chemical reactions, and mechanical systems.\n• Probability and Statistics: Invalid numbers, such as probabilities of a random event in fact never happening, exist in functions of distributions usually, and figure in financial, epidemiological and social scientific works in the form of statistical analyses, hypothesis testing and predicting the future crowd.\n\nReal-life Applications of Negative Numbers in Electricity and Magnetism\n• Polarity: In an electational circuit, positive polarity refers to the direction the electrons are flowing, but negative numbers represents the negative one in an electrial circuit.\n• Current Flow: The direction of current explained by the negative value is opposite to the normal flow direction, and this makes it possible to perform analyzes of circuits where components are wired in reverse than is usually chosen.\n• Voltage: A negative potential voltage means the potential difference between the reference point and the other point is out of sync which is why it important for understanding the electrical potentials and circuit operation.\n• Charge: Negative charges are charges that have the net value of more than the number of protons. This can be seen in static electricity and charge coming from the electromagnetic fields that are around us.\n• Magnetic Fields: Magnitudes of negative numbers accompanied with the magnetic field vector opposing the reference direction represent the applied vector, making the process of contemplating the magnetic induction, Lorentz’s forces and electromagnetics simpler.\n• Circuit Analysis: Contrary to the perception of negative numbers being confusing and problematic, they actually help physicists when they are solving for circuits with resistors, capacitors, and inductors, using Kirchhoff laws and Ohm laws.\n\nReal-life Applications of Negative Numbers in Gaming and Sports\n• Scoring: Negative numbers are used in games to signal penalty or the subtraction points from a player's or team's score as a way of accomplishing a mistake or illegal play.\n• Rankings: As for example, negative numbers can be used to downgrade ranks on leaderboards of games below certain level of achievement in standings or a success in sports which shows poorer performance or lack of skill in some respect.\n• Health or Stamina: In role-playing (RPG) or soccer-simulation games, negative numbers can show a character health, strength, or the vital energy level drop due to injuries or tiredness or any other stressful conditions.\n• Penalties and Fouls: Negative numbers are also utilized to keep accounting of the team or player’s penalties or fouls in sports like football, basketball, or hockey and sometimes it can be a decisive factor in the game outcomes and the players game strategies as they move forward.\n• Ratings and Attributes: Such use of negative numbers can acquire low ratings or lack of qualities in gaming characters or incompetencies in sports players via which weakenings or deficiencies in their abilities or skills can be represented.\n• Score Differentials: Negative numbers may denote the point differentials in sports competitions where one team or player trails behind the opponent, highlighting the margin of deficit to be overcome.\n\nWhether it's managing finances, measuring cold temperatures, understanding directions and depths, or even figuring out how much money is in the bank, negative numbers help us quantify and navigate these situations. They play a crucial role in science and engineering too, from tracking the speed and direction of moving objects in physics to designing electrical circuits and managing ecosystems. In education, sports, and gaming, they help us keep score, assess performance, and simulate real-world scenarios. Essentially, negative numbers give us a complete picture by allowing us to represent and analyze not just gains and increases, but also losses and decreases in a meaningful way.\n\nAt which situations are the negative numbers used in numerical plots?\n\nWhat are the roles that negative numbers plays in mathematics?\n\nHow does negative numbers multiplication or division work?"

        "document": "Integers and absolute value are fundamental mathematical concepts that we encounter daily in countless real-world situations.\n\nReal life examples of integers can be found everywhere, from temperature readings that go above and below zero to elevator buttons showing floors above and below ground level. In banking, positive integers represent deposits while negative integers show withdrawals or debts. Sports statistics use integers to track scores, yardage gains and losses, and player rankings. Negative integers in real world applications are particularly visible in weather forecasts, where temperatures can drop below freezing, and in measuring depths below sea level.\n\nThe importance of integers in our daily life extends beyond basic counting. When plotting numbers on a coordinate system or working with number line integers, we gain a visual representation of both positive and negative values. This helps in understanding concepts like credit and debt, profit and loss, or elevation changes. Understanding absolute value in math adds another crucial dimension - it tells us the distance a number is from zero, regardless of whether it's positive or negative. For example, the absolute value of -11 is 11, just as the absolute value of 11 is 11, because both are 11 units away from zero on a number line. This concept is particularly useful in calculating distances, determining temperature differences, or measuring magnitude changes in various scientific applications. In financial contexts, absolute value helps assess the size of price changes regardless of whether they're increases or decreases. Through integers in real life situations, students learn to navigate mathematical concepts that directly apply to everyday scenarios, from managing bank accounts to understanding weather patterns and sports statistics. The practical applications of integers and absolute values demonstrate how mathematical concepts aren't just abstract ideas but essential tools for understanding and interacting with the world around us."

        "document": "The word integer is derived from a Latin word meaning whole. This is a form of a number that can be expressed without a fractional component. For example, 2, 8,90, -6, and many more, but numbers like 9.75, √3, etc., are not regarded as integers. Integers include 0 and are denoted by a capital alphabet Z. It also consists of positive natural numbers, their additive inverse, and negative integers. It is interesting to note that integers are a subset of all rational numbers and rational numbers are a subset of the real numbers. The alphabet Z is represented in different ways to denote different types of integers like Z+, Z+ or Z> (positive integers).\n\nClassification of integers is of 3 types; positive integer, negative integer, and 0. There are 5 properties of integers that determine the operations performed by the integers. It is these properties of integers that help us to solve equations and expressions.\n• None Closure property- For addition and subtraction closure property states that if 2 integers are added or subtracted the outcome is always an integer. For example, 5-2= 3 where 3 is an integer. For multiplication of integers also the closure property is valid as a product of 2 integers is also an integer. This closure property is not always valid for division as the quotient is not always an integer and can be a fraction or decimal, for example, 5/10= ½\n• None Commutative property- This property is valid for operations like addition and multiplication. According to this property, the order of the terms does not make any difference in the answer. For example, a+b = b+a and a×b = b×a, but this property is not valid for subtraction and division\n• None Associative property- This property is about the grouping of numbers and their effect on the answer. The associative property is valid for addition and multiplication but not valid for subtraction and division. For example a + ( b+c) = (a+b) + c and similarly for multiplication\n• None Distributive property- It tells us about the distribution of one operation over the other within a bracket. Mostly for the distributive property of integers the multiplication is used over addition and subtraction. For example, a × (b±c) = a×b ± a×c\n• None Identity property- According to this property addition of any integer to 0 will give the same integer and here 0 is known as the additive identity. The multiplicative identity states that the multiplication of any integer with 1 gives us the same integer and here 1 is known as the multiplicative inverse\n\nHow are Integers Used in Everyday Life?\n\nThrough some examples, we will explain to you how are integers used in everyday life.\n• None One good example of an integer in real life is the sea level; like for mountains, the distance is generally said as +1354m above the sea level, while the submarine can be at a distance of -55m below the sea level\n• None Another example is the temperature, as the temperature can be expressed as positive or negative that is below or above 0 degrees\n• None The speed limit can also be expressed in terms of the integer. If you increase speed more than a specified speed, it is regarded as positive, and if we decrease the speed below a given limit, it is regarded as negative\n• None In games, if we win, then the points increase; on the other hand, if we lose the game, the points decrease, which is also an example of integers\n• None The floors of the building can also be considered as an example of integers\n\nThe word integer is derived from a Latin word that means whole. Integers can be expressed without a fractional component, for example, 2, 8,90, -6, and many more but numbers like 9.75, √3, etc., are not regarded as integers. Integers are classified as 0, positive, and negative integers. The integers follow 5 properties named closure property, associative property, distributive property, commutative property, and identity property. All these properties are used for different calculations used while solving algebra. It is also used in our daily lives during the calculation of profit/ loss, measuring the distance with respect to sea level, determining the temperature, calculating the distance travelled, and many more such examples. In fact, we explained the concept with a few examples of how are integers used in everyday life."
