We will discuss more details about prop validation further down this page.\n\nVue's reactivity system tracks state usage based on property access. E.g. when you access in a computed getter or a watcher, the prop gets tracked as a dependency. So, given the following code: // runs only once before 3.5 // re-runs when the \"foo\" prop changes in 3.5+ In version 3.4 and below, is an actual constant and will never change. In version 3.5 and above, Vue's compiler automatically prepends when code in the same block accesses variables destructured from . Therefore the code above becomes equivalent to the following: // `foo` transformed to `props.foo` by the compiler In addition, you can use JavaScript's native default value syntax to declare default values for the props. This is particularly useful when using the type-based props declaration: If you prefer to have more visual distinction between destructured props and normal variables in your IDE, Vue's VSCode extension provides a setting to enable inlay-hints for destructured props.

This means you should not attempt to mutate a prop inside a child component. If you do, Vue will warn you in the console:\n\nThere are usually two cases where it's tempting to mutate a prop:\n• None The prop is used to pass in an initial value; the child component wants to use it as a local data property afterwards. In this case, it's best to define a local data property that uses the prop as its initial value: // counter only uses props.initialCounter as the initial value; // it is disconnected from future prop updates. // counter only uses this.initialCounter as the initial value; // it is disconnected from future prop updates.\n• None The prop is passed in as a raw value that needs to be transformed.

This is because in JavaScript objects and arrays are passed by reference, and it is unreasonably expensive for Vue to prevent such mutations.\n\nThe main drawback of such mutations is that it allows the child component to affect parent state in a way that isn't obvious to the parent component, potentially making it more difficult to reason about the data flow in the future. As a best practice, you should avoid such mutations unless the parent and child are tightly coupled by design.

        "document": "This article was last reviewed and updated on 4 October 2024.\n\nYou can send state from a parent component to a child component in Vue using props:\n• Static props: You can pass data from a parent component to its child using static values within the parent’s template. This is useful when the value doesn’t need to change dynamically\n• Dynamic props: You can pass reactive state (like arrays or objects) from the parent to the child using , allowing for automatic updates when the data changes\n• Typed props: In the child component, you can define prop types such as , , to validate the incoming data, ensuring proper validation and preventing potential errors\n\nHandling props can be tricky. In this article, we’ll dive deeper into how to pass data between a parent component to its child using props in Vue 3. You can find the complete code for this tutorial on GitHub. Let’s get started!\n\nThis article is suited for developers of all stages, including beginners. To follow along, you’ll need Node.js version ≥16.x installed. You can verify if you already have it installed by running the command in your terminal or the command prompt.\n\nYou’ll also need a code editor; I highly recommend VS Code.\n\nAt the time of writing, Vue 3 is the latest version. To follow along, you’ll need Vue 3 installed globally on your machine.\n\nBefore getting started, download a Vue starter project. Unzip the downloaded project, navigate into the unzipped file, and then run the command below to keep all the dependencies up to date:\n\nWhat are props in Vue?\n\nIn Vue, props are custom attributes that you can register on any component. You define your data on the parent component and give it a value. Then, you go to the child component that needs that data and pass the value to a prop attribute. Therefore, the data becomes a property in the child component.\n\nIn a component, the syntax looks like the following code:\n\nIn a non- component, the syntax looks like this:\n\nTo access this data dynamically from any component that needs it, you can use the root component as the parent component, store the data, and then register props.\n\nVue uses a more flexible approach to props where you can specify the type of a prop using JavaScript constructors:\n\nThe types can be , , , , or .\n\nThe type accepts only string values, the prop with type accepts only numeric values, the prop with type accepts only Boolean values, and the prop with or type accepts only array or object values respectively.\n\nWhy should you use props in Vue?\n\nLet’s say you have an array of objects that you want to display in two different components. For example, component A renders the artist names from the array of objects while component B renders the artist names and countries from the array of objects. Your first instinct might be to:\n• Display them in the template\n\nThis solution is great initially but becomes more complicated as you add more components. Let’s demonstrate this with the starter project you’ve opened in VS Code.\n\nOpen the file and copy the code block below:\n\nCreate a new file in the components folder called and paste the following code block inside it:\n\nTo register the new component you just created, open the file and copy the code below inside it:\n\nIn the VS Code terminal, serve up the application in the development environment with the following command:\n\nIt should look like the following:\n\nYou’ll notice that if you had only about five more components, you would have to keep copying the data in every component. Imagine there was a way that you could define the data in a parent component and then bring it into every child component that needs it by using the property name. This is where using props to pass data from parent to child components comes in handy.\n\nBecause you’ve chosen the root component to be your parent component, you first have to define the data object that you want to share dynamically inside of the root component.\n\nIf you’ve followed this article from the start, open up your file and copy the data object code block inside of the script section:\n\nTo receive props in a component, you have to specify the props that you want to receive inside of that component. After defining the data, go into the two test components, and delete the data objects inside them, and add the specifications in the script section, as shown below:\n\nTo let the Vue engine know that you have props you want to dynamically pass to child components, you have to indicate this in the Vue instance. This is done in the template section as shown here:\n\nThe directive in Vue is used to bind HTML attributes or component props dynamically. In the code above, we used to bind , which is the name of the data object array in the script section, and , the prop name in the test components, which you set up in the section above.\n\nIf you set it up without the following directive, you won’t see any output; neither the Vue compiler nor ESLint will flag it as an error or warning:\n\nTherefore, it’s important to pay attention and remember to use for every dynamic binding.\n\nAfter you’ve set up the props in your Vue app, you can then use them inside of your component as if the data were defined inside of the same component. Therefore, in our demo case, you can set up method calls and easily access .\n\nBy strongly typing the props, you can also ensure that your component only receives exactly the data type you want it to. In our demo, for instance, you can ensure that only arrays get passed down to your component by setting up authentication as follows:\n\nTherefore, whenever you add a wrong type, say, a , you’ll get a warning in the console telling you that the type it received is not the type it expected:\n\nHow to set default values for props\n\nYou can set default values for props using the property in the option:\n\nThe default value of a prop should correspond with the specified type.\n\nHow to work with multiple props in Vue\n\nWorking with multiple props is similar to working with a single prop, but you need to declare and define each prop in the component’s props option.\n\nUsing the component in a parent component, you can pass values for each prop as follows:\n\nIn the child component definition, declare the option as an object where each property represents a prop. You can specify the type, default value, and other options for each prop:\n\nIn the above code, is a required prop of type , is an optional prop of type with a default value of 42, while is an optional prop of type with a default value of .\n\nYou can use the props in the child component’s methods or computed properties just like any other data property:\n\nIn the child component’s template, you can access the props using the syntax:\n\nWorking with multiple props in the Vue 3 Composition API\n\nIn the Vue 3 Composition API, working with multiple props is slightly different than in the Options API discussed above:\n• Declaring props: In the Composition API, you use the function to declare props, while the Options API uses a option object\n• Accessing props: Props in the Composition API are accessed via the argument passed to the function, while in the Options API, they are directly available within the component’s options\n• Destructuring props: Destructuring props in the Composition API can lose reactivity unless you use utilities like\n\nIn the Composition API, you can use the function to declare and define props:\n\nThe first argument in the function is the argument. You can use the prop values directly in the template as follows:\n\nYou may want to destructure the object in the setup function; by doing this, the destructured variables will lose reactivity. It is therefore recommended to always access props in the form of .\n\nBut if you need to destructure the props, or need to pass a prop into an external function while retaining reactivity; you can do so with the and utility APIs:\n\nHere, we use to turn the props into an object of refs to destructure. is a ref that tracks .\n\nYou can use the destructured prop values directly in the template as follows:\n\nHow to pass functions to props in Vue\n\nIn Vue 3, you can pass functions as props to child components in a similar way to passing any other data.\n\nIn the parent component, define a function that you want to pass as a prop:\n\nIn the child component, declare the prop to accept a function. You can do this by adding a option and specifying the type as :\n\nYou can then use it in the child component template as follows:\n\nIn this article, we explored how to send state from parent to child components in Vue using Vue 3 props. We demonstrated how to define props for both static and dynamic data and how to enforce prop types for better validation. We also discussed how to send state as an object in Vue, making it easier to pass complex data structures.\n\nFor additional information, check out Vue’s official documentation on props."

        "document": "I decided to organize my Vue application by having a set of classes that encapsulate the data, maintain their own state (edited, deleted, etc) and know how to sync their state with the back-end system. Maybe this was a bad choice, because it plays very badly with Vue as follows.\n\nThis is an extremely simplified version of what I am doing, that illustrates the problem with the minimum of code.\n\nAssume that I have an object that encapsulates the data as follows:\n\nAnd I want to display this in a Vue component like this:\n\nThis will correctly allow the name propertyto edited, and the Save button will be displayed, but clicking on the Save button will not make the Save button disappear. This is because passing a as a prop will wrap it in a reactive proxy. The proxy is deeply reactive, but only when accessing the properties via the proxy.\n\nWhen the save button is clicked, the does update its property, but this property is not reactive unless it is mutated via the prop, and therefore the UI does not reflect the change of state.\n\nI thought I could fix the problem by explicitly making the property reactive, so I modified my class like this:\n\nThis passes all the unit tests and appears to be correct, but at runtime is throws an exception saying that object does not have a property. This is odd, because I am using strict mode on typescript, and it should not be possible to get a type mismatch at runtime like this.\n\nThe reason that this doesn't work, is that when Vue makes an object reactive, it \"unwraps\" reactive properties, essentially modifying my object's property from to . This runtime modification of the type is pretty unpleasant behavior by Vue IMHO.\n\nTo get this working, I moved the state management logic out of the data model and into the component. This works, but I think is a very poor separation of concerns, and also means that I need to repeat this logic in each component that mutates the state.\n\nThe revised code looks like this:\n\nWhich works, but feels inadequate. What is the better way of doing this?\n\nIn my actual solution the code is much more sophisticated than this minimal demonstration.\n\nI have a Vue component with slots for the view, edit, delete and new user experiences. This component now has the state management logic in it, even though it can be used with any data model that inherits from a base class.\n\nThis is not great, because data models have slightly different behaviors (maybe cannot delete if they have child records, or permissions may be required etc).\n\nI am also planning to have a web socket inform the front end when data changes on the back end, and the logical place to update the state is in the data model, not the Vue component, but this won't work, because the data model cannot update its own state.\n\nFor more clarity, I am editing my question to include something about why I want to do this.\n\nI love the way that Vue manages UI state in a reactive way, and loved working with Vue in its early days. I am coming back to Vue now because I enjoyed working with it so much, and absolutely want to have it manage the state of my UI.\n\nHowever I want to keep the logic for managing the state of the data separate from the logic to manage the UI state. To understand why, consider a scenario in which I have a piece of data that is displayed in different ways in various parts of the UI, and I receive a web socket message telling my application that another user deleted this data. In this case I want all components that are displaying this data to render it in its deleted representation.\n\nThe reactive features of Vue will of course propagate the change in state to the UI, but who mutates the state in response to the web socket message? I can't duplicate this logic in all components that display this kind of data. It would be ideal if the data model was able to update it's own state.\n\nRenderless component - I think this is what @TheHiggsBroson suggested"

        "document": "When building modern web applications with Vue.js, managing the state of your application becomes one of the most critical aspects. Whether you’re dealing with simple component data or complex data interactions across multiple components, how you manage state can greatly impact the performance, scalability, and maintainability of your app.\n\nVue.js offers multiple ways to manage state, ranging from simple local component state to more sophisticated options like Vuex, Vue’s official state management library. In this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore everything you need to know about state management in Vue.js, walking through the various techniques and best practices to keep your application organized and efficient.\n\nWhat is State in Vue.js?\n\nState in Vue.js refers to the data or information that an application needs to keep track of over time. This data can be anything from a user’s name in a form to a list of items fetched from an API. State management involves storing, updating, and sharing this data throughout your application in an organized and efficient way.\n\nManaging state correctly is crucial because it affects how your application behaves, what it displays, and how it responds to user input. In Vue.js, state can be as simple as using in a component or as complex as using a global state management library like Vuex.\n\nIn Vue.js, state can generally be divided into two categories:\n\nLocal State: State that is managed within a single component. This state is usually temporary and tied to specific components or user interactions. For example, form input values, toggle switches, and counters are common examples of local state.\n\nGlobal State: State that needs to be shared between multiple components or persisted across different pages of an application. For instance, user authentication data or application-wide settings (like a theme or language preference) would be managed in global state.\n\nThe more complex your application becomes, the more important it is to choose the right strategy for managing both local and global state.\n\nLocal state refers to state that only a specific component cares about. This is the simplest form of state management, and for many small applications, it may be all you need. In Vue.js, local state is handled using the function within a component.\n\nThe function in Vue.js is used to define reactive properties in a component. These properties are part of the component’s local state and can be updated as the user interacts with the app.\n\nExample: Using to Manage Local State\n\nIn this simple example, is managed as local state, and the method updates it. The function is perfect for handling local state that only affects the component itself.\n\nAs your component’s state becomes more complex, you may need to use computed properties or watchers to reactively handle changes in state.\n\nComputed properties are useful when you need to derive state from other state values. In this case, depends on and , and Vue automatically recalculates it whenever either of these properties changes.\n\nExample: Using Watchers for State Changes\n\nWatchers are useful when you want to react to changes in data, such as making an API call when a certain value changes.\n\nHere, the watcher listens for changes in the state and triggers the method whenever the user types something new in the input field.\n\nKeep local state as local as possible: Only use local state for data that is specific to a component and doesn’t need to be shared with others.\n\nAvoid over-complicating local state: If a component’s state becomes too complex, consider breaking it into smaller components or using Vuex to manage the state globally.\n\nAs your application grows, you may need to share state between multiple components. While prop drilling (passing data down through props) can work for small applications, it quickly becomes cumbersome as your app scales. This is where Vuex comes in.\n\nVuex is a state management library for Vue.js applications. It acts as a centralized store for all your app’s state, allowing different components to access and update state without relying on props or events. Vuex provides a structured and predictable way to manage global state, making it easier to debug, maintain, and scale your application.\n\nState: The data you want to share across components.\n\nTo use Vuex, you first need to install it in your Vue project:\n\nOnce installed, you can set up the Vuex store.\n\nThe Vuex store is the central place where all your application’s state is stored. You define the store by creating a new Vuex instance and passing it the state, mutations, actions, and getters.\n\nHere, the store contains a state, a mutation to increment it, an action to trigger the mutation, and a getter to compute based on the current state.\n\nStep 2: Providing the Store to Your App\n\nNext, you need to provide the Vuex store to your Vue.js application by importing it into your main file and passing it to the function.\n\nNow, the store is available to all components in your application.\n\nTo access state from the Vuex store in your components, use the helper function.\n\nIn this example, the state is accessed using , the getter is accessed using , and the action is called using . Vuex makes it simple to manage state across components without having to pass props or emit events.\n\nBest Practices for Using Vuex\n\nKeep the store clean: Avoid overloading your Vuex store with too much logic. Keep it focused on managing state, and move any complex logic to actions or utility functions.\n\nUse actions for async logic: Always handle asynchronous operations (like API requests) inside Vuex actions, not mutations. Mutations should be reserved for synchronous state changes.\n\nModularize the store: As your app grows, you can break the Vuex store into modules to manage state more effectively. This keeps the codebase organized and easier to maintain.\n\nBy modularizing the store, you can separate different parts of the state into distinct modules, each with its own state, mutations, actions, and getters. This approach helps keep your codebase clean and scalable.\n\nWhen to Use Vuex vs. Local State\n\nDeciding whether to use local component state or Vuex depends on the scope and complexity of the data you’re managing:\n\nUse local state for data that is only relevant to a single component or does not need to be shared across multiple components. This includes form inputs, toggle switches, and temporary state.\n\nUse Vuex when you need to share state across multiple components, especially in large applications. Global state, such as user authentication or app-wide settings, is best managed with Vuex.\n\nWhile Vuex is the official state management library for Vue, there are alternatives like Pinia (another lightweight state management library for Vue 3) or even using the Composition API with and to manage state without a store. However, for most large-scale applications, Vuex remains the most popular and powerful solution.\n\nOnce you’ve mastered the basics of state management with Vuex and local state, the next step is exploring more advanced strategies to optimize your Vue.js applications. In this section, we’ll delve into some advanced techniques that can help you further enhance the performance, scalability, and maintainability of your applications. These include Vuex Plugins, server-side state management, Vuex with TypeScript, and best practices for testing Vuex stores.\n\nVuex allows you to extend its functionality using plugins, which can be used to monitor mutations, handle persistent state, log state changes, or integrate with third-party libraries. Vuex plugins are simply functions that run whenever the store is initialized.\n\nA Vuex plugin can be used to log every mutation that occurs in your store. This can be useful for debugging or for implementing custom functionality.\n\nYou can then apply this plugin when creating your Vuex store:\n\nWith this setup, every time a mutation is committed, the plugin will log the mutation type and payload to the console.\n\nAnother common use case for Vuex plugins is state persistence. By default, Vuex does not persist state between page reloads. However, you can use the vuex-persistedstate plugin to automatically save the state to local storage or session storage.\n\nNow, the state will be automatically saved to the browser’s local storage, and when the user returns to the app, their data will still be there. This is especially useful for things like user preferences or cart data in e-commerce apps.\n\nIn many applications, you’ll need to manage state that comes from an external API, like fetching data from a server. While Vuex is mainly designed for client-side state, you can integrate it seamlessly with server-side data using actions.\n\nWhen you need to fetch data from an API and store it in Vuex, the typical flow involves dispatching an action to make the API request, then committing a mutation to store the result in the state.\n\nIn this example, the action fetches posts from an API and commits the mutation to update the store. The state is now accessible throughout your application.\n\nIf you’re building a server-side rendered (SSR) app with Vue.js, managing state between the server and client can become more complex. Vuex plays a crucial role in this scenario, as it allows you to pre-fetch data on the server and then hydrate the store with this data on the client.\n\nTo handle this with Vuex, you typically need to fetch data during the server-side rendering process and then pass the initialized state to the client.\n\nHere, the server pre-fetches the state with the action, then embeds the state in the HTML response so the client can pick it up and use it when rendering the app on the browser.\n\nAs applications grow in complexity, adding TypeScript to your Vuex setup can greatly improve code maintainability and prevent errors. Vuex 4 (which is compatible with Vue 3) provides better support for TypeScript.\n\nYou can define your state, actions, and mutations with TypeScript to ensure type safety across your application.\n\nIn this example, we’ve defined the types for our Vuex store using TypeScript. This ensures that the store’s state, mutations, actions, and getters are all type-checked, reducing the likelihood of bugs and improving the developer experience.\n\nTesting your Vuex store is crucial to ensure that your state management logic works as expected. You can use tools like Jest or Mocha to test your Vuex store independently of the rest of your application.\n\nMutations are simple to test because they are pure functions. You pass in the state and a payload, and the mutation modifies the state accordingly.\n\nActions can be a bit more complex to test because they often involve asynchronous operations. You can mock API calls and test that the correct mutations are committed.\n\nHere, the action is tested by mocking the API and ensuring that the correct mutation ( ) is committed with the expected payload.\n\nAs your Vuex store grows, performance optimization becomes essential. One way to optimize is by using getters to only recompute data when needed. Another way is by breaking your store into modules, which allows for better organization and scalability.\n\nGetters can be used to derive data from the state. They are reactive and are only recalculated when their dependencies change.\n\nBy using getters, you avoid recalculating values every time the component renders, which can help improve performance when dealing with large datasets.\n\nFor larger applications, modularizing your Vuex store can help keep the codebase clean and manageable. Vuex allows you to split your store into separate modules, each with its own state, mutations, actions, and getters.\n\nBy breaking your store into modules, you can manage each piece of state independently, making it easier to maintain and scale as your application grows.\n\nState management is a fundamental part of building interactive, data-driven applications with Vue.js. By understanding when to use local state with and when to implement global state with Vuex, you can create scalable, maintainable, and efficient applications.

        "document": "Ah, Vue.js 3. If you’re reading this, you’ve probably taken the plunge into one of the most elegant and versatile JavaScript frameworks out there. I remember when I first started dabbling with Vue.js, excited to build dynamic and reactive user interfaces. But as I dove deeper, I hit a snag that many developers face: managing state efficiently.\n\nState management in Vue.js can quickly become a daunting task, especially as your application grows. What starts as a few simple components sharing data can morph into a tangled web of dependencies and data flows that leave you scratching your head, wondering where it all went wrong. But don’t worry — I’ve been there, done that, and emerged victorious.\n\nIn this article, I want to take you through my journey of mastering state management in Vue.js 3. I’ll share with you the strategies, tools, and techniques I’ve learned along the way that have not only saved my sanity but also dramatically improved my application’s performance. If you’re struggling with state management or just looking to fine-tune your approach, you’re in the right place. Let’s dive in.\n\nThe Basics of State Management in Vue.js 3: Where It All Begins\n\nBefore we get into the nitty-gritty of efficient state management, let’s take a step back and cover the basics. Vue.js 3, like any frontend framework, requires a way to manage the state — essentially, the data that your application relies on to function.\n\nState in Vue.js refers to the reactive data that drives the behavior and appearance of your components. It could be anything from the current user logged into your app, to the list of items in a shopping cart, to the current settings of a user interface.\n\nIn a simple application, managing state might involve just passing props down to child components and emitting events back up to the parent. But as your application grows in complexity, this method becomes cumbersome, error-prone, and hard to maintain.\n\nWhen I first started working on a large Vue.js project, I quickly realized that managing state effectively was crucial. Without a proper state management strategy, my app became sluggish, hard to debug, and nearly impossible to scale. Components were tightly coupled, and small changes in one part of the app could have unpredictable effects elsewhere.\n\nEffective state management, on the other hand, allows your application to be scalable, maintainable, and, most importantly, performant. It ensures that your data flows in a predictable manner, making it easier to debug issues and add new features without breaking existing functionality.\n\nOne of the most powerful features of Vue.js 3 is its reactivity system. Understanding and leveraging this system was my first major breakthrough in managing state efficiently.\n\nVue’s reactivity system is what makes Vue.js so magical. It allows you to declaratively bind your data to the DOM, and Vue automatically updates the DOM when your data changes. This system is built on top of JavaScript’s object, which intercepts operations on your state and triggers updates to the DOM when necessary.\n\nIn Vue.js 3, the reactivity system has been improved and made more flexible with the introduction of and functions. These functions allow you to create reactive state and objects, respectively.\n\nIn the early days of my Vue.js journey, I struggled with managing state across multiple components. I often found myself passing data through multiple layers of components or resorting to global variables (a big no-no) to share state. But once I fully understood Vue’s reactivity system, everything changed.\n\nI started using and to create reactive state that could be shared between components without all the boilerplate of prop drilling or event emitting. For example:\n\nWith this setup, I could import my state into any component and use it directly, knowing that Vue would automatically handle updates and reactivity. This was a game-changer for me, simplifying my code and making it much easier to manage state as my application grew.\n\nWhile Vue’s reactivity system is fantastic for managing local state within components or small-scale applications, it doesn’t scale well for larger apps. As my project grew, I found myself needing a more robust solution for managing global state — something that could handle complex data flows, multiple modules, and shared state across different parts of the app.\n\nOne of the first issues I encountered was prop drilling — passing data down through multiple layers of components. As the number of components grew, so did the complexity of managing props and events. It became difficult to track where data was coming from, and changes in one component often required changes in several others.\n\nThis approach was not only error-prone but also made my code harder to read and maintain. I knew I needed a better way to manage global state, and that’s when I discovered Vuex.\n\nVuex is the official state management library for Vue.js, and it’s designed to solve the exact problems I was facing. Vuex provides a centralized store for all the state in your application, allowing you to manage global state in a single place and making it easier to track and debug changes.\n\nWhen I first started using Vuex, I was a bit overwhelmed by its concepts — state, getters, mutations, actions, and modules. But once I got the hang of it, Vuex became an indispensable tool in my Vue.js toolkit.\n\nOne of my first successes with Vuex was refactoring an overly complex component tree that relied heavily on prop drilling. I moved all the shared state into a Vuex store and refactored the components to use Vuex for state management instead of passing data through props.\n\nHere’s a simplified example of what that looked like:\n\nWith Vuex in place, my components became much simpler:\n\nThis refactor dramatically simplified my code, making it easier to manage, debug, and extend. The centralized state in Vuex allowed me to keep track of all my application’s state in one place, making it easier to reason about and control.\n\nThe Pitfalls of Vuex: When Complexity Strikes Back\n\nWhile Vuex was a significant improvement over my previous state management approach, it wasn’t without its challenges. As my application continued to grow, so did my Vuex store. The store began to resemble a monolithic structure, with an ever-expanding list of state, mutations, actions, and getters.\n\nStore bloat is a common issue in large Vuex applications. As you add more state and functionality to your store, it can become difficult to manage. My Vuex store started to grow out of control, with hundreds of lines of code, making it hard to find and update specific pieces of state.\n\nThis bloat also made my application slower, as Vuex began to have a significant impact on performance. The more state I managed in Vuex, the more my app’s performance suffered, with increasing delays in state updates and UI reactivity.\n\nTo combat store bloat, I began breaking my Vuex store into modules. Vuex allows you to split your store into separate modules, each with its own state, mutations, actions, and getters. This modular approach not only helps reduce store bloat but also makes your store more organized and easier to manage.\n\nFor example, in an e-commerce app, I split my store into modules like , , and :\n\nThen, I combined these modules in my main store:\n\nThis modular approach not only improved the organization of my store but also made it easier to scale. I could now add new modules as needed without worrying about the entire store becoming unmanageable.\n\nAnother powerful feature of Vuex is dynamic modules, which allow you to register modules on the fly. This is particularly useful for large applications where certain modules are only needed in specific parts of the app.\n\nBy registering modules dynamically, I was able to keep my store lean and improve my app’s performance. For example, I only loaded the module when the user navigated to the admin section of the app:\n\nThis approach ensured that my store only contained the state it needed at any given time, reducing bloat and improving performance.\n\nThe Evolution: Moving Beyond Vuex with Pinia\n\nJust when I thought I had mastered state management with Vuex, the Vue.js ecosystem introduced a new state management library that promised to simplify things even further: Pinia. At first, I was skeptical — after all, Vuex had served me well. But as I started experimenting with Pinia, I quickly realized it offered a more modern and streamlined approach to state management.\n\nPinia is a state management library for Vue.js that aims to be a more intuitive and less opinionated alternative to Vuex. It provides a similar feature set but with a simplified API and better TypeScript support.\n\nWhat initially drew me to Pinia was its lightweight and modular design. Unlike Vuex, Pinia doesn’t require you to structure your store with specific concepts like mutations or actions. Instead, it allows you to use plain JavaScript functions, making it easier to learn and use.\n\nWhen I decided to give Pinia a try, I started by refactoring a small section of my Vuex-powered app to use Pinia. To my surprise, the transition was smoother than expected, and the resulting code was more concise and easier to understand.\n\nHere’s an example of how I refactored a Vuex module to Pinia:\n\nThe biggest benefit I found with Pinia was its simplicity. I no longer had to worry about the boilerplate code that Vuex required, such as defining mutations and separating state from actions. Instead, I could focus on writing clean, straightforward code.\n\nPinia also improved the developer experience by providing better TypeScript support and a more flexible API. For example, with Pinia, I could define my store directly in the component file if needed, making it easier to manage smaller pieces of state.\n\nThe performance improvements were another significant advantage. Since Pinia is designed to be more lightweight than Vuex, it had a noticeable impact on my app’s performance, especially in larger applications.\n\nBy this point in my journey, I had a solid grasp of state management in Vue.js 3, having moved from basic reactivity to Vuex and finally to Pinia. But as I continued to work on more complex applications, I discovered additional strategies and techniques that helped me optimize state management even further.\n\nOne of the most powerful features of Vue.js 3 is the Composition API, which allows you to organize your component logic in a more modular and reusable way. While it’s commonly used for handling component logic, the Composition API can also be a game-changer for managing local state.\n\nI began using the Composition API to create custom hooks for managing state in specific parts of my app. For example, in an app with a complex form, I created a custom hook to manage the form state:\n\nThis approach allowed me to encapsulate form state management logic in a reusable function that I could import into any component. It kept my components clean and focused on their primary responsibility — rendering the UI.\n\nAs my applications grew in complexity, debugging state management issues became more challenging. Fortunately, the Vue Devtools extension provided invaluable assistance in tracking down issues and optimizing state management.\n\nVue Devtools allows you to inspect the state of your Vuex store or Pinia store in real-time, making it easier to see how state changes over time. It also provides detailed information about component reactivity and allows you to time travel through state changes to pinpoint the exact moment when something went wrong.\n\nI highly recommend making Vue Devtools a part of your development workflow. It saved me countless hours of frustration by providing insights into my application’s state that would have been difficult to obtain otherwise.\n\nAs my Vue.js apps grew, I noticed that performance could become an issue, particularly with large, monolithic stores. To address this, I began employing lazy loading and code-splitting techniques.\n\nIn larger apps, not all state needs to be loaded upfront. By dynamically loading Vuex or Pinia modules only when they are needed, I could reduce the initial load time of my application and improve performance.\n\nFor example, in a large e-commerce app, I only loaded the product and cart modules when the user navigated to the store section:\n\nThis approach kept my initial bundle size small, improving load times and reducing the amount of unused state in memory.\n\nCode splitting is another technique I used to improve performance. By splitting my Vuex or Pinia store into separate chunks that could be loaded on demand, I ensured that users only downloaded the code they needed at any given time.\n\nFor example, I used Webpack’s dynamic import feature to split my store modules:\n\nThis approach not only improved performance but also made my codebase more modular and easier to maintain.\n\nManaging state in Vue.js 3 has been a journey of discovery, challenges, and triumphs. From grappling with prop drilling and tightly coupled components to mastering Vuex and exploring the possibilities with Pinia, I’ve learned that state management is both an art and a science.\n\nThe key to efficient state management lies in understanding the tools at your disposal and knowing when and how to use them. Whether you’re just starting with Vue.js or looking to refine your existing applications, I hope this article has provided valuable insights into the strategies and techniques that can help you manage state more effectively.\n\nRemember, state management is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Your approach will depend on the specific needs of your application, the complexity of your state, and the performance goals you have in mind. But with the right strategies, you can create Vue.js applications that are not only powerful and dynamic but also maintainable and scalable.\n\nSo, what’s next on your state management journey? Whether you’re diving into Pinia, optimizing your Vuex store, or exploring the Composition API, I encourage you to keep experimenting, learning, and refining your approach. The Vue.js ecosystem is constantly evolving, and there’s always something new to discover.\n\nHappy coding, and may your state management be ever efficient!"

        "document": "Technically, every Vue component instance already \"manages\" its own reactive state. Take a simple counter component as an example:\n\nIt is a self-contained unit with the following parts:\n• The state, the source of truth that drives our app;\n• The view, a declarative mapping of the state;\n• The actions, the possible ways the state could change in reaction to user inputs from the view.\n\nThis is a simple representation of the concept of \"one-way data flow\":\n\nHowever, the simplicity starts to break down when we have multiple components that share a common state:\n• Multiple views may depend on the same piece of state.\n• Actions from different views may need to mutate the same piece of state.\n\nFor case one, a possible workaround is by \"lifting\" the shared state up to a common ancestor component, and then pass it down as props. However, this quickly gets tedious in component trees with deep hierarchies, leading to another problem known as Prop Drilling.\n\nFor case two, we often find ourselves resorting to solutions such as reaching for direct parent / child instances via template refs, or trying to mutate and synchronize multiple copies of the state via emitted events. Both of these patterns are brittle and quickly lead to unmaintainable code.\n\nA simpler and more straightforward solution is to extract the shared state out of the components, and manage it in a global singleton. With this, our component tree becomes a big \"view\", and any component can access the state or trigger actions, no matter where they are in the tree!\n\nIf you have a piece of state that should be shared by multiple instances, you can use to create a reactive object, and then import it into multiple components:\n\nNow whenever the object is mutated, both and will update their views automatically - we have a single source of truth now.\n\nHowever, this also means any component importing can mutate it however they want:\n\nWhile this works in simple cases, global state that can be arbitrarily mutated by any component is not going to be very maintainable in the long run. To ensure the state-mutating logic is centralized like the state itself, it is recommended to define methods on the store with names that express the intention of the actions:\n\nAlthough here we are using a single reactive object as a store, you can also share reactive state created using other Reactivity APIs such as or , or even return global state from a Composable:\n\nThe fact that Vue's reactivity system is decoupled from the component model makes it extremely flexible.\n\nIf you are building an application that leverages Server-Side Rendering (SSR), the above pattern can lead to issues due to the store being a singleton shared across multiple requests. This is discussed in more details in the SSR guide.\n\nWhile our hand-rolled state management solution will suffice in simple scenarios, there are many more things to consider in large-scale production applications:\n• Integrating with the Vue DevTools, including timeline, in-component inspection, and time-travel debugging\n\nPinia is a state management library that implements all of the above. It is maintained by the Vue core team, and works with both Vue 2 and Vue 3.\n\nExisting users may be familiar with Vuex, the previous official state management library for Vue. With Pinia serving the same role in the ecosystem, Vuex is now in maintenance mode. It still works, but will no longer receive new features. It is recommended to use Pinia for new applications.\n\nPinia started out as an exploration of what the next iteration of Vuex could look like, incorporating many ideas from core team discussions for Vuex 5. Eventually, we realized that Pinia already implements most of what we wanted in Vuex 5, and decided to make it the new recommendation instead.\n\nCompared to Vuex, Pinia provides a simpler API with less ceremony, offers Composition-API-style APIs, and most importantly, has solid type inference support when used with TypeScript."
