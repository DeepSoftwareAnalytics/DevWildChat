The forms of this directive (commonly known as pragmas) specified by C standard are prefixed with . A C compiler is free to attach any meaning it likes to other pragmas. Most GNU-defined, supported pragmas have been given a prefix.\n\nC99 introduced the operator. This feature addresses a major problem with ‘ ’: being a directive, it cannot be produced as the result of macro expansion. is an operator, much like or , and can be embedded in a macro.\n\nIts syntax is , where can be either a normal or wide-character string literal. It is destringized, by replacing all ‘ ’ with a single ‘ ’ and all ‘ ’ with a ‘ ’. The result is then processed as if it had appeared as the right hand side of a ‘ ’ directive. For example,\n\nhas the same effect as . The same effect could be achieved using macros, for example\n\nThe standard is unclear on where a operator can appear. The preprocessor does not accept it within a preprocessing conditional directive like ‘ ’. To be safe, you are probably best keeping it out of directives other than ‘ ’, and putting it on a line of its own.\n\nThis manual documents the pragmas which are meaningful to the preprocessor itself. Other pragmas are meaningful to the C or C++ compilers. They are documented in the GCC manual.\n\nGCC plugins may provide their own pragmas.\n\nallows you to check the relative dates of the current file and another file. If the other file is more recent than the current file, a warning is issued. This is useful if the current file is derived from the other file, and should be regenerated. The other file is searched for using the normal include search path. Optional trailing text can be used to give more information in the warning message. Sometimes, there is an identifier that you want to remove completely from your program, and make sure that it never creeps back in. To enforce this, you can poison the identifier with this pragma. is followed by a list of identifiers to poison. If any of those identifiers appears anywhere in the source after the directive, it is a hard error. For example, If a poisoned identifier appears as part of the expansion of a macro which was defined before the identifier was poisoned, it will not cause an error. This lets you poison an identifier without worrying about system headers defining macros that use it. will not produce an error. This pragma takes no arguments. It causes the rest of the code in the current file to be treated as if it came from a system header. See System Headers. causes the preprocessor to issue a warning diagnostic with the text ‘ ’. The message contained in the pragma must be a single string literal. Similarly, issues an error message. Unlike the ‘ ’ and ‘ ’ directives, these pragmas can be embedded in preprocessor macros using ‘ ’. If is seen when scanning a header file, that file will never be read again, no matter what. It is a less-portable alternative to using ‘ ’ to guard the contents of header files against multiple inclusions. These pragmas are accepted, but have no effect."

They only affect how code is displayed in the editor.\n\nImproved Readability — In large files, regions can separate sections such as member variables, constructors, methods, and utility functions.\n\nCode navigation — Allows for quick navigation by collapsing parts of the file you’re not currently working on.\n\nFocus on Relevant Sections — Hide parts of the code that are not currently relevant to your work\n\nOveruse Can Be Problematic — Excessive use of regions can make the code harder to read by hiding too much.\n\nNot a Language Feature — Only works in environments that support it; has no effect in plain-text or less sophisticated editors.\n\nEncourages Large Files — May lead to keeping all logic in one file instead of modularizing the code.\n\nFAQ : Can we use nested regions?"
