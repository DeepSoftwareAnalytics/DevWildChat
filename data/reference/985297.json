That’s a lot of information packed into a small space, making it a super efficient way to store data.\n\nQR codes became one of the most practical digital innovations every businessmen and marketer are turning into these days, as they provide an easy way to share information with customers, promote products or services cost-effectively, and track customer behavior for improved marketing strategies.\n\nPython includes several packages that make creating QR codes straightforward. If you want to generate QR codes with personalized content using Python, you’ve come to the right place!\n\nThe three main and easier Python packages to create QR codes are:\n\nWe’ll learn how to use them in this article.

Not only is it super easy to use, but it also gives us the flexibility to create QR codes for various types of data, including URLs, text, email addresses, phone numbers, and more.\n\nBut that’s not all — qrcode also lets us customize our QR codes to our heart’s content. We can easily adjust the size and color of the code to match our branding or aesthetic preferences. Whether we’re creating QR codes for a website, a promotional campaign, or just for fun, qrcode is the way to go. So why not give it a try and start generating stunning QR codes today?\n\nWe can install qrcode (with pillow for generating images) via pip.

The default border is 4 pixels, which is very thick.\n• : controls the size of the QR code. It accepts an integer from 1 to 40. Version 1 being the smallest with a 21×21 matrix.\n\nIf you aren’t sure about which version to use, you can set version to None and add the function which will set the version automatically for you:\n\nThen, we add the content the QR code will display by calling the function and add the text as an argument:\n\nFinally, we generate the QR code with the function.\n\nThis function can be used to apply specific colors using two arguments:\n• changes the painting color of the QR code,\n• changes the background color of the QR code."

But did you know that you can create your own QR codes using Python?\n\nIn this article, we'll explore how to generate QR codes programmatically using Python. With just a few lines of code, you can create custom QR codes for your websites, business cards, or any other data you want to share digitally.\n\nTo generate QR codes in Python, we'll use the qrcode library. If you haven't already installed it, you can do so using pip:\n\nIn this code snippet, we define a generate_qr_code function that takes the data you want to encode and the file name for the QR code image. We then create a QR code object with the specified data and parameters, generate the QR code image, and save it to a file.\n• Low (ERROR_CORRECT_L): Good for small QR codes but only fixes up to 7% of errors.\n• Moderate (ERROR_CORRECT_M): Commonly used, fixes up to 15% of errors.\n• High (ERROR_CORRECT_Q): Fixes up to 25% of errors, suitable for more damage-prone situations.\n• Very High (ERROR_CORRECT_H): Fixes up to 30% of errors, useful for heavily damaged codes.\n\nWhen choosing, think about how likely the code will get damaged, the QR size, and printing space. Higher levels make larger codes. In the code, ERROR_CORRECT_L is used for a balance between error correction and code size, but you can change it to suit your needs.\n\nIn QR codes, \"version\" means the size or capacity. Versions range from 1 to 40, with 1 being small and 40 being large. Each version stores different amounts of data, and bigger versions store more. When making a QR code, you pick the version based on how much data you need to encode and how big you want the QR code to be. Python's qrcode library lets you choose the version, giving you control over the QR code's size and capacity.\n\nYou can customize various aspects of the QR code, such as the error correction level, box size, border size, and colors. Experiment with different parameters to create QR codes that suit your needs.\n\nGenerating QR codes with Python opens up a world of possibilities for sharing information in a convenient and efficient way. Whether you're a developer, business owner, or enthusiast, mastering the art of QR code generation can enhance your digital presence and streamline your workflows.\n\nSo why not give it a try? Start creating your own QR codes with Python today and unlock the power of digital information sharing!"
