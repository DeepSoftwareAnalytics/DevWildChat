You can use Regedit.exe to make some changes to the registry on a Windows NT 4.0-based or Windows 2000-based computer, but some changes require Regedt32.exe. For example, you cannot add or change REG_EXPAND_SZ or REG_MULTI_SZ values with Regedit.exe on a Windows NT 4.0-based or Windows 2000-based computer. Regedt32.exe is the primary Registry Editor for Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000. If you must use Regedt32.exe, you cannot use Registration Entries (.reg) files to modify the registry. For more information about the differences between Regedit.exe and Regedt32.exe, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:\n\nImportant This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:\n\n322756 How to back up and restore the registry in Windows This step-by-step article describes how to add, modify, or delete registry subkeys and values by using a Registration Entries (.reg) file. Regedit.exe uses .reg files to import and export registry subkeys and values. You can use these .reg files to remotely distribute registry changes to several Windows-based computers. When you run a .reg file, the file contents merge into the local registry. Therefore, you must distribute .reg files with caution.\n\n\n\nback to the top\n\nA .reg file has the following syntax:\n\n\n\nRegistryEditorVersion\n\nBlank line\n\n [RegistryPath1]\n\n\n\n \"DataItemName1\"=\"DataType1:DataValue1\"\n\nDataItemName2\"=\"DataType2:DataValue2\"\n\nBlank line\n\n [RegistryPath2]\n\n\n\n \"DataItemName3\"=\"DataType3:DataValue3\"\n\n\n\n where:\n\n\n\nRegistryEditorVersion is either \"Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00\" for Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003, or \"REGEDIT4\" for Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0. The \"REGEDIT4\" header also works on Windows 2000-based, Windows XP-based, and Windows Server 2003-based computers.\n\n\n\nBlank line is a blank line. This identifies the start of a new registry path. Each key or subkey is a new registry path. If you have several keys in your .reg file, blank lines can help you to examine and to troubleshoot the contents.\n\n\n\nRegistryPathx is the path of the subkey that holds the first value you are importing. Enclose the path in square brackets, and separate each level of the hierarchy by a backslash. For example: [HKEY_LOCAL_ MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\System] A .reg file can contain several registry paths. If the bottom of the hierarchy in the path statement does not exist in the registry, a new subkey is created. The contents of the registry files are sent to the registry in the order you enter them. Therefore, if you want to create a new subkey with another subkey below it, you must enter the lines in the correct order.\n\n\n\nDataItemNamex is the name of the data item that you want to import. If a data item in your file does not exist in the registry, the .reg file adds it (with the value of the data item). If a data item does exist, the value in your .reg file overwrites the existing value. Quotation marks enclose the name of the data item. An equal sign (=) immediately follows the name of the data item.\n\n\n\nDataTypex is the data type for the registry value and immediately follows the equal sign. For all the data types other than REG_SZ (a string value), a colon immediately follows the data type. If the data type is REG_SZ , do not include the data type value or colon. In this case, Regedit.exe assumes REG_SZ for the data type. The following table lists the typical registry data types: For more information about registry data types, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:\n\n 256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows registry\n\n DataValuex immediately follows the colon (or the equal sign with REG_SZ) and must be in the appropriate format (for example, string or hexadecimal). Use hexadecimal format for binary data items.\n\n\n\n Note You can enter several data item lines for the same registry path.\n\n\n\n Note the registry file should contain a blank line at the bottom of the file.\n\n\n\nback to the top\n\nTo add a registry subkey or add or change a registry value, make the appropriate changes in the registry, and then export the appropriate subkey or subkeys. Exported registry subkeys are automatically saved as .reg files. To make changes to the registry and export your changes to a .reg file, follow these steps:\n• Click Start, click Run, type regedit in the Open box, and then click OK.\n• Locate and then click the subkey that holds the registry item or items that you want to change.\n• Click File, and then click Export.\n\n\n\n This step backs up the subkey before you make any changes. You can import this file back into the registry later if your changes cause a problem.\n• In the File name box, type a file name to use to save the .reg file with the original registry items, and then click Save.\n\n\n\n Note Use a file name that reminds you of the contents, such as a reference to the name of the subkey.\n• In the right pane, add or modify the registry items you want.\n• Repeat steps 3 and 4 to export the subkey again, but use a different file name for the .reg file. You can use this .reg file to make your registry changes on another computer.\n• Test your changes on the local computer. If they cause a problem, double-click the file that holds the backup of the original registry data to return the registry to its original state. If the changes work as expected, you can distribute the .reg you created in step 6 to other computers by using the methods in the \"Distributing Registry Changes\" section of this article.\n\nTo delete a registry key with a .reg file, put a hyphen (-) in front of the RegistryPath in the .reg file. For example, to delete the Test subkey from the following registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software put a hyphen in front of the following registry key in the .reg file: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Test The following example has a .reg file that can perform this task. [-HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Test] To delete a registry value with a .reg file, put a hyphen (-) after the equals sign following the DataItemName in the .reg file. For example, to delete the TestValue registry value from the following registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Test put a hyphen after the \"TestValue\"= in the .reg file. The following example has a .reg file that can perform this task. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Test \n\n \"TestValue\"=- To create the .reg file, use Regedit.exe to export the registry key that you want to delete, and then use Notepad to edit the .reg file and insert the hyphen.\n\n\n\nback to the top"

Using reg to configure the registry of remote computers limits the parameters that you can use in some operations. Check the syntax and parameters for each operation to verify that they can be used on remote computers.\n\nDon't edit the registry directly unless you have no alternative. The registry editor bypasses standard safeguards, allowing settings that can degrade performance, damage your system, or even require you to reinstall Windows. You can safely alter most registry settings by using the programs in Control Panel or Microsoft Management Console (MMC). If you must edit the registry directly, back it up first."

        "document": "This article describes the Windows registry and provides information about how to edit and back it up.\n\nThe Microsoft Computer Dictionary, Fifth Edition, defines the registry as:\n\nA central hierarchical database used in Windows 98, Windows CE, Windows NT, and Windows 2000 used to store information that is necessary to configure the system for one or more users, applications, and hardware devices.\n\nThe Registry contains information that Windows continually references during operation, such as profiles for each user, the applications installed on the computer and the types of documents that each can create, property sheet settings for folders and application icons, what hardware exists on the system, and the ports that are being used.\n\nThe Registry replaces most of the text-based .ini files that are used in Windows 3.x and MS-DOS configuration files, such as the Autoexec.bat and Config.sys. Although the Registry is common to several Windows operating systems, there are some differences among them. A registry hive is a group of keys, subkeys, and values in the registry that has a set of supporting files that contain backups of its data. The supporting files for all hives except HKEY_CURRENT_USER are in the folder on Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Vista. The supporting files for HKEY_CURRENT_USER are in the folder. The file name extensions of the files in these folders indicate the type of data that they contain. Also, the lack of an extension may sometimes indicate the type of data that they contain.\n\nIn Windows 98, the registry files are named User.dat and System.dat. In Windows Millennium Edition, the registry files are named Classes.dat, User.dat, and System.dat.\n\nThe following table lists the predefined keys that are used by the system. The maximum size of a key name is 255 characters.\n\nThe following table lists the data types that are currently defined and that are used by Windows. The maximum size of a value name is as follows:\n\nLong values (more than 2,048 bytes) must be stored as files with the file names stored in the registry. This helps the registry perform efficiently. The maximum size of a value is as follows:\n\nBefore you edit the registry, export the keys in the registry that you plan to edit, or back up the whole registry. If a problem occurs, you can then follow the steps in the Restore the registry section to restore the registry to its previous state. To back up the whole registry, use the Backup utility to back up the system state. The system state includes the registry, the COM+ Class Registration Database, and your boot files. For more information about how to use the Backup utility to back up the system state, see the following articles:\n• None Back up and restore your PC\n• None How to use the backup feature to back up and restore data in Windows Server 2003\n\nTo modify registry data, a program must use the registry functions that are defined in Registry Functions.\n\nAdministrators can modify the registry by using Registry Editor (Regedit.exe or Regedt32.exe), Group Policy, System Policy, Registry (.reg) files, or by running scripts such as VisualBasic script files.\n\nWe recommend that you use the Windows user interface to change your system settings instead of manually editing the registry. However, editing the registry may sometimes be the best method to resolve a product issue. If the issue is documented in the Microsoft Knowledge Base, an article with step-by-step instructions to edit the registry for that issue will be available. We recommend that you follow those instructions exactly.\n\nYou can use Registry Editor to do the following actions:\n\nThe navigation area of Registry Editor displays folders. Each folder represents a predefined key on the local computer. When you access the registry of a remote computer, only two predefined keys appear: HKEY_USERS and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.\n\nMicrosoft Management Console (MMC) hosts administrative tools that you can use to administer networks, computers, services, and other system components. The Group Policy MMC snap-in lets administrators define policy settings that are applied to computers or users. You can implement Group Policy on local computers by using the local Group Policy MMC snap-in, Gpedit.msc. You can implement Group Policy in Active Directory by using the Active Directory Users and Computers MMC snap-in. For more information about how to use Group Policy, see the Help topics in the appropriate Group Policy MMC snap-in.\n\nCreate a Registration Entries (.reg) file that contains the registry changes, and then run the .reg file on the computer where you want to make the changes. You can run the .reg file manually or by using a logon script. For more information, see How to add, modify, or delete registry subkeys and values by using a Registration Entries (.reg) file.\n\nThe Windows Script Host lets you run VBScript and JScript scripts directly in the operating system. You can create VBScript and JScript files that use Windows Script Host methods to delete, to read, and to write registry keys and values. For more information about these methods, visit the following Microsoft Web sites:\n\nWindows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is a component of the Microsoft Windows operating system and is the Microsoft implementation of Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM). WBEM is an industry initiative to develop a standard technology for accessing management information in an enterprise environment. You can use WMI to automate administrative tasks (such as editing the registry) in an enterprise environment. You can use WMI in scripting languages that have an engine on Windows and that handle Microsoft ActiveX objects. You can also use the WMI Command-Line utility (Wmic.exe) to modify the Windows registry.\n\nFor more information about WMI, see Windows Management Instrumentation.\n\nFor more information about the WMI Command-Line utility, see A description of the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) command-line utility (Wmic.exe).\n\nYou can use the Console Registry Tool for Windows (Reg.exe) to edit the registry. For help with the Reg.exe tool, type at the Command Prompt, and then click OK.\n\nTo restore the registry, use the appropriate method.\n\nTo restore registry subkeys that you exported, double-click the Registration Entries (.reg) file that you saved in the Export registry subkeys section. Or, you can restore the whole registry from a backup. For more information about how to restore the whole registry, see the Method 2: Restore the whole registry section later in this article.\n\nTo restore the whole registry, restore the system state from a backup. For more information about how to restore the system state from a backup, see How to use Backup to protect data and restore files and folders on your computer in Windows XP and Windows Vista.\n\nFor more information, visit the following Web sites:\n\nThe Windows Server Catalog of Tested Products is a reference for products that have been tested for Windows Server compatibility.\n\nData Protection Manager (DPM) is a key member of the Microsoft System Center family of management products and is designed to help IT professionals manage their Windows environment.
