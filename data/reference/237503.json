This can be attributed to the change of timing in floods from spring to autumn and winter, when the sea levels during flood peaks is higher, causing backwater effect. Even though the mean depth will not increase notably (from 1.14 m to 1.25 m) during MHQ, compared to the control period (1985–2014), the inundated area will expand by 15% due to the flat terrain. The increase in flooding may be restrained by adaptive regulations: strategies favoring ecologically sustainable and recreationally desirable lake water levels were modeled. The demands of environment, society, and hydropower are not necessarily contradictory in terms of climate change adaptation, and regulation could provide an adaptive practice in the areas of increased flooding. We investigated how hydro-climatological changes would affect fluvial forces and inundated area during a typical high-flow situation (MHQ, mean high discharge), and how adaptive regulation could attenuate the climate change impacts in a low-relief river of the Southern Boreal climate area. We used hydrologically modeled data as input for 2D hydraulic modeling. Our results show that, even though ...

We then apply the extended HMS in a one-way coupled mode to the bias corrected Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment in East Asia (CORDEX-EA) regional climate simulations under two Representative Concentration Pathways – RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Results indicate that climate change poses new challenges to water resources management for the PLB, with a likely decrease of water availability in the dry season but an increase of water availability, flood magnitude and flood frequency in the flood season till 2049. The local reservoir network can mitigate climate impacts by displacing excessive water resources in the flood season to the dry season and mitigating floods across the basin. Despite that, much of the southern basin is likely to see a higher risk of water shortage in the dry season, while most of the northern basin is expected to see a higher flood risk. The approach and findings are expected to improve the understanding of the role of reservoirs in the context of climate change, and provide implications for water resources management and climate change adaptation strategies on a regional scale. The Poyang Lake Basin (PLB) is expected to see more precipitation and higher temperature by 2050. Due to climate change, it is advisable to identify the vulnerable area and to investigate if the local reservoir network of hundreds of larger reservoirs and thousands of smaller reservoirs can effectively mitigate the climate-induced hydrologic variation. Therefore, the local high-density reservoir ...

However, the critical RRC information is not readily available for most of the dams and reservoirs around the world. Furthermore, the large variability in RRCs observed for different dam types (e.g., irrigation, flood control, and hydroelectricity) and the year-to-year natural variability of climatic forcing and operational needs for the same reservoir makes it difficult to use generalized RRCs. In this work we explored two basic questions: (1) Can we derive the RRCs as a function of the reservoir storage and monthly precipitation? and (2) Can we transfer the RRC information derived for reservoirs with storage data to reservoirs without storage data? To answer these questions, an artificial neural network (ANN) model has been applied, using storage data from the US Geological Survey and US Bureau of Reclamation and precipitation data from the North American Land Data Assimilation System, for approximately 400 reservoirs to model RRCs across the United States. Preliminary results show that RRCs can be reasonably modeled for reservoirs with seasonal storage data. However, the transferability of RRCs to reservoirs without storage data can be limited. Along with presentation of results from this study, the applicability and limitations of using the modeled RRCs in large-scale hydrological model employed for catastrophe flood risk assessment will also be discussed. An accurate characterization of reservoir routing processes in large scale hydrological models can be vitally important. Reservoirs are often managed by prescribed design guidelines or Reservoir Rule Curves (RRCs) developed based on factors such as climate and intended use of the reservoir, among others. These RRCs play a central role in actual reservoir operations and the observed flow regime ...

The mean value for Manning's coefficient for A. donax was 0.066, and it varied from 0.019 to 0.121 (n = 37). Model simulations showed that A. donax within a stream channel had a direct effect on flooded area, causing increases up to 10% above baseline conditions, which represent cross sections with no A. donax present. Storm size also affected A. donax's impact on the size of the flooded area. Using the maximum value for Manning's n for A. donax in the simulations resulted in an increase in the flooded area from 10% to 19% compared to simulations in which there was no A. donax present. Impacts of A. donax on other stream systems could differ, but they can be estimated using the value for Manning's n for A. donax provided in this study. This information can be used in conjunction with natural resource conditions, such as soil type, to prioritize areas for A. donax management. The presence of vegetation in a channel may influence water movement in the channel and the surrounding land in several ways. One hypothesis is that increased abundance of the invasive plant Arundo donax in a watercourse contributes to increased flooding risk. To test this hypothesis, we determined Manning's coefficient for A. donax and subsequently used it in the HEC-RAS model to estimate the ...

The numerical results show that the operation of the TGD changes flood processes, including the timing and magnitude of flood peaks in Dongting Lake. The TGD can effectively reduce the flood level in Dongting Lake, which is mainly caused by the flood water from the upper reach of the Yangtze River. This is not the case, however, for floods mainly induced by flood water from four main rivers in the catchment. In view of this, a comprehensive strategy for flood management in Dongting Lake is required. Non-engineering measures, such as warning systems and combined operation of the TGD and other reservoirs in the catchment, as well as traditional engineering measures, should be further improved. Meanwhile, a sustainable philosophy for flood control, including natural flood management and lake restoration, is recommended to reduce the flood risk. Full operation of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) reduces flood risk of the middle and lower parts of the Yangtze River Basin. However, Dongting Lake, which is located in the Yangtze River Basin, is still at high risk for potentially severe flooding in the future. The effects of the TGD on flood processes were investigated using a hydrodynamic model. The 1998 and 2010 flood events before and after the ...

According to the reservoir water level, the new operation rule can be decided. For optimization: (1) WEB-DHM is calibrated for each dam's inflows separately; (2) then the calibrated WEB-DHM is used to simulate inflows and outflows by assuming outflow proportional to inflow; and (3) the proportion coefficients are optimized with Shuffle Complex Evolution method (SCE-UA), to fulfill an objective function towards minimum flood risk at downstream and maximum reservoir water storage for future use. The GSMaP product offers hourly global precipitation maps in near real-time (about four hours after observation). Aiming at near real-time reservoir operation in large river basins, the integrated modeling system takes the inputs from both an operational global quantitative precipitation forecast (JMA-GPV; to achieve an optimal operation rule in the assumed lead time period) and the GSMaP product (to perform current operation with the obtained optimal rule, after correction by gauge rainfall). The newly-developed system was then applied to the Red River Basin, with an area of 160,000 km2, to test its performance for near real-time dam operation. In Vietnam, three reservoirs are located in the upstream of Hanoi city, with Hoa Binh the largest (69% of total volume). After calibration with the gauge rainfall, the inflows to three reservoirs are well simulated; the discharge and water level at Hanoi city are also well reproduced with the actual dam releases. With the corrected GSMaP rainfall (by using gauge rainfall), the inflows to reservoirs and the water level at Hanoi city can be also reasonably reproduced. The study aims at achieving an optimal operation rule in the lead time period (with the quantitative precipitation forecast) and then using it to perform current operation (with the corrected GSMaP rainfall). At Hanoi, there are relatively low flows in July, but high floods in August 2005. Results show that with the actual operation, dangerous water level in Hanoi was observed; while with the lead-time operation, the water level in Hanoi can be obviously cut down, and maximum water storage is also achieved for Hoa Binh reservoir at the end of flood season. The climate change-induced variability in hydrological cycles directly affects regional water resources management. For improved multiple multi-objective reservoir operation, an integrated modeling system has been developed by incorporating a global optimization system (SCE-UA) into a distributed biosphere hydrological model (WEB-DHM) coupled with the reservoir routing module.

Following the robust drying and warming shown by CMIP5 models in this region, the VIC model simulations indicate decreases in annual runoff of about 40 % by the end of the century, larger that the projected precipitation decreases (up to 30 %). Center timing of runoff shifts to earlier dates, 3–5 weeks by the end of the century. The Andes snowpack is projected to be less than half of the reference period by mid-century. The projected hydroclimatic regime is also expected to increase the severity and frequency of extreme events. The probability of having extended droughts, such as the recently experienced mega-drought (2010–2015), increases to up to 5 events/100 years. On the other hand, probability density function of annual maximum daily runoff indicates an increase in the frequency of flood events. The estimated return periods of annual maximum runoff events depict more drastic changes and increase in the flood risk as longer return periods are considered (e.g. 25-yr and 50-yr). This study examines the projections of hydroclimatic regimes and extremes over Andean basins in central Chile (∼ 30–40 S). We have used daily precipitation and temperature data based on observations to drive and validate the VIC macro-scale hydrological model in the region of interest at a 0.25 × 0.25 degree resolution.

        "document": "On the representation of water reservoir storage and operations in large-scale hydrological models: implications on model parameterization and climate change impact assessments\n\nTo discuss the impact of water reservoirs on the parameterization of hydrological models, we first compare the results of the calibration exercise carried out with and without reservoirs and then proceed by comparing the performance of two selected parameterizations on the climate change impact assessment. The optimization-based parameterization exercise yielded a total of 118 and 109 parameterizations (or Pareto-efficient solutions) for the VIC implementations with and without reservoirs, respectively. To prove our hypothesis that the calibration process may somehow compensate for a deficiency in the model structure – the absence of reservoirs, in our case – we begin by analyzing the values of the goodness-of-fit statistics, namely NSE and TRMSE. Figure 5 reports the probability plots of NSE and TRMSE values obtained for the two model setups: results show that the calibration exercise yields a reasonable modeling accuracy, with NSE and TRMSE varying in the ranges 0.68–0.79 and 8.10–16.69. More interestingly, these results show that the NSE and TRMSE values of both model setups belong to the same range of variability and follow an almost identical distribution. In addition, all NSE and TRMSE values of the models without reservoirs fall within the 95 % confidence limits calculated using the NSE and TRMSE values attained by the models with reservoirs. To corroborate this finding, we carried out a Kolmogorov–Smirnov two-sample test to reject the null hypothesis that the values of NSE (and TRMSE) produced by the two model setups come from the same distribution. For both goodness-of-fit statistics, the hypothesis cannot be rejected (with a 5 % significance level). Overall, this confirms that the accuracy of the models is not affected by the presence (absence) of the reservoirs. How does the parameterization compensate for the absence of water reservoirs? To answer this question, we visualize both goodness-of-fit statistics (NSE and TRMSE) and model parameters (D , D , W , b, d and d ) in a parallel-coordinate plot (Fig. 6). These eight variables are shown in eight parallel axes, so each line connecting the axes represents a parameterization (i.e., a solution of the optimization problem) along with the corresponding value of the goodness-of-fit statistics (i.e., the objectives). Blue and red lines denote solutions obtained with and without reservoirs, respectively. First of all, one can notice that while NSE and TRMSE spread over the same ranges (results discussed in the previous paragraph), the presence or absence of reservoirs consistently yields different parameterizations. Let's analyze them. The value of b – characterizing the shape of the VIC curve – belongs to two distinct ranges (0.319–0.495 and 0.002–0.195) for the model implementation with and without reservoirs, respectively, indicating that the model without reservoirs has higher infiltration and lower surface runoff than the model with reservoirs (recall that a higher value of b leads to a lower infiltration rate and higher surface runoff; Sect. 3.1.1). A similar observation applies to the parameters D , D , and W , which determine the shape of the baseflow curve. In this case, the model without reservoirs has higher values of D (i.e., maximum baseflow) and lower values of D and W (i.e., fraction of D where rapidly increasing baseflow begins, and fraction of the maximum soil moisture in the lower layer where rapidly increasing baseflow occurs), suggesting that the absence of reservoirs leads to model parameterizations that favor the generation of baseflow in the lower layer. Finally, we can note that d (the thickness of the first layer) in the models without reservoirs tends to be larger, indicating that these model instances increase the water storage capacity of the top layer. The only parameter that does not appear to depend on the absence (or presence) of water reservoirs is d , the thickness of the second soil layer. This result is corroborated by a global sensitivity analysis, which shows that d is indeed the parameter with the least influence on the model output (Fig. S2 in the Supplement). Overall, it appears that the calibration process compensates for the absence of water reservoirs by determining values of the soil parameters that can somehow `mimic' the alterations caused by water reservoirs, namely an increase in the evaporation and delay in the peak flows – obtained by increasing infiltration, baseflow, and soil water storage capacity. To further understand the unintended consequences of the absence of water reservoirs, we select two model parameterizations (with and without reservoirs) characterized by the same performance over the period 1996–2005. The values of NSE, TRMSE, and model parameters are illustrated in Fig. 7a, while the simulated daily discharges produced by both models are compared in the scatter plot of Fig. 7b. In Fig. 8, we contrast the average values of simulated baseflow and runoff during the dry (December–April) and wet (May–November) seasons of the period 1996–2005. Unsurprisingly, results show that during the dry season the model without reservoirs generates more baseflow and runoff than the model with reservoirs (left four panels of Fig. 8): during the dry months, hydropower reservoirs release part of the water stored during the monsoon (recall the rule curves described in Sect. 3.1.2) – a process simulated by the model without reservoirs by increasing both baseflow and runoff – and, therefore, the discharge at the catchment outlet. During the wet season, we find an opposite trend: in these months, hydropower reservoirs tend to store part of the water (thus reducing the discharge at the catchment outlet), so the model without reservoirs slightly decreases the discharge by reducing baseflow and runoff (right four panels of Fig. 8). We also note that the difference between the two models is clearer during the dry season, when a larger amount of the water volumes is controlled by the hydropower reservoirs. The effect of such flawed representation of baseflow and runoff is further demonstrated by validating the simulated discharge at Jiuzhou station. Figure 9 shows a macroscopic difference between the models calibrated with and without reservoirs. In particular we note that the model calibrated without reservoirs largely overestimates the dry season flow and slightly underestimates the wet season one; a result confirmed by the values of NSE (equal to 0.82 and 0.79 for the model with and without reservoirs) and TRMSE (equal to 21.48 and 28.95). One may also suspect that these unintended consequences could further propagate in downstream applications of the models, such as a climate change impact assessment. To begin the climate change impact assessment, we compare the data produced by the GCMs over the reference and future period (1996–2005 and 2050–2060). In general, the total annual precipitation in the Lancang basin is projected to increase under almost all climate change scenarios – only the CSIRO MK3-RCP 8.5 scenario projects a −3.12 % decrease in the total annual precipitation. Yet, we observe a large spatial variability in the total annual rainfall within each scenario (see Fig. S3). For example, in ACCESS-RCP 4.5, rainfall changes vary between −2 % in the central part of the basin to more than +10 % in the southern part. All scenarios (but for CSIRO MK3-RCP 8.5) tend to share a similar spatial pattern, in which the lower part of the basin exhibits an increase in the projected precipitation. As for the temperature, we observe an increase in both minimum and maximum temperature across all scenarios (see Fig. S4), with higher warming for the RCP 8.5. Also in this case, we can note some variability across the GCMs as well as the spatial domain. As discussed in Hoang et al. (2016), these precipitation and temperature scenarios represent an improvement with respect to the CMIP3 ones, which show a broader variability. However, there still are some non-negligible differences across the scenarios that are likely to cause different projections of the annual and monthly river discharges. The expected climate change impacts on the annual river discharge at Chiang Saen are synthesized in Table 4, where we report the relative changes in discharge with respect to the period 1996–2005. Interestingly, it appears that the projections are robust with respect to the representation of the water reservoirs. Indeed, the model with and without reservoirs yield comparable ensemble means and ranges for the two RCPs. Specifically, we find that the annual discharge is predicted to increase in the vast majority of the scenarios, in response to the increase in precipitation described above. Such similarity between the projections is arguably attributable to the calibration process, which generates models producing similar aggregate performance measures at Chiang Saen station. What is perhaps more interesting is a comparison between the monthly discharges at Chiang Saen predicted by the models with and without reservoirs. While both models produce similar ensemble ranges (see Fig. 10a–d), a closer analysis of the data reveals a non-negligible difference in the minimum, maximum, and average monthly discharges (across the GCM scenarios) produced by the two models (Fig. 10e–f). In particular, the model with reservoirs predicts higher discharges in the July–September period and lower discharges in October and November. Note that such difference is consistent across both RCPs. Since both models share the same rainfall and temperature scenarios, the only cause for this stark difference must lie in the unintended consequences of the parameterization process. As explained in Sect. 4.1, the model without reservoirs shows two “artifacts” that help compensate for the absence of the hydropower reservoirs: first, it increases both baseflow and runoff during the dry season (to account for the water discharged to sustain hydropower production in the dry months); second, it decreases baseflow and runoff (to account for part of the water stored by the dams during the wet months). The latter artifact is responsible for the macroscopic change in the hydrograph described above. In the wetter conditions depicted by the GCM and RCP scenarios, the hydropower reservoirs of the Lancang basin receive larger inflows, part of which is directly spilled into the downstream reaches (data not shown). This is an unprecedented situation for the model without reservoirs, which cannot simulate an increase in the use of the spillways. In fact, this model tends to reproduce the dynamics learned during the calibration process, that is, storing part of the water (in the lower soil layer) during the monsoon season and slowly discharging it in the following months. Naturally, the difference between the monthly discharges predicted by the two models becomes even more apparent when we consider Jiuzhou station, which was not used in the calibration process. As depicted in Fig. 11, the model without reservoirs consistently yields higher discharges in the pre-monsoon season and lower discharges in the monsoon season. Note that, in some months, the difference between the average monthly discharges produced by the two models causes an uncertainty larger than the one surrounding the downscaled climate projections. For instance, the average monthly discharge in March (under both RCPs) predicted by two models is about 500 and 750 m3 s−1, that is, a 50 % difference.\n\nThis work contributes to the existing literature on large-scale hydrological modeling by studying the effect of water reservoir storage and operations on the parameterization of process-based models. To this purpose, we developed a computational framework consisting of VIC and the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm ε-NSGA-II, which we used to calibrate the model parameters through a simulation–optimization process. Our framework also includes a novel variant of VIC that simulates both storage dynamics and operations of water reservoirs. Using the Lancang river basin as a case study, we calibrated two implementations of VIC, with and without reservoirs. In line with previous studies (e.g., de Paiva et al., 2013; Abbaspour et al., 2015), we found that the model without reservoirs attains a reasonable modeling accuracy. In fact, we found that the calibration process of both model implementations yields de facto the same values of the goodness-of-fit statistics (NSE and TRMSE), suggesting that the model parameterization helps compensates for a structural error, namely the absence of the water reservoirs. More specifically, this effect is achieved by determining the values of six soil parameters (D , D , W , b, d and d ) that let this model implementation emulate the presence of water reservoirs. The first implication of a flawed parameter estimation stands in a poor representation of key hydrological processes, such as surface runoff, infiltration, and baseflow. In our case, we found that, during the dry months, the models calibrated without water reservoirs generate a higher amount of baseflow and runoff than the models with reservoirs. This is an artifact needed to reproduce the higher discharges of hydropower dams that sustain the production of hydro-electricity in the dry season. Vice versa, baseflow and runoff are reduced during the wet months, so as to account for the decrease in peak flows caused by the fact that dams store part of the water for the following dry season. A poor parameter estimation is also likely to affect several downstream applications of a hydrological model. In our second experiment we exemplify this concept through a climate change impact assessment, in which we contrasted the annual and monthly discharges projected by two selected models (with and without reservoirs). Both models show a similar trend in the flow regime – i.e., increased monthly discharges during the monsoon season, caused by the projected increase in precipitation – a result found in previous studies (Lauri et al., 2012; Hoang et al., 2016, 2019). Yet, one cannot neglect the different nuances of the flow regime alterations predicted by the two models. In particular, the model with reservoirs presents higher discharges at the peak of the monsoon season than the model without reservoirs. These nuances may impact some of the conclusions of a climate change impact assessment as well as other model-based studies depending on a reliable estimation of the flow regime. Like any hydrological modeling study, this work also builds on a few modeling assumptions that should be properly discussed. First, our model calibration focuses solely on six main parameters controlling the rainfall–runoff process and assumes that they are homogeneously distributed across the basin. As explained in Sect. 3.1.1, the choice of these parameters is already established in the literature (Dan et al., 2012; Park and Markus, 2014; Xue et al., 2015); yet, it is reasonable to expect that the use of more parameters could further improve the model accuracy. As for the use of homogeneously distributed parameters, our modeling choice is justified by the fact that the use of heterogeneously distributed parameters would largely impact the computational requirements of the calibration process. We also note that there are no reasons to believe that the use of more (or spatially distributed) parameters would deeply alter the main findings of this work. Second, the large spatial domain – and associated soil water retention capacity – might be a factor controlling the capability of the calibration process to compensate for the absence of water reservoirs. In other words, such capability might be dependent on the relation between soil water retention capacity and total storage volume of the reservoirs. In a small basin regulated by a large dam, a modified representation of runoff, infiltration, and baseflow may not be sufficient to compensate fully for a poor representation of reservoir storage and operations. Third, we focussed our attention on water reservoirs, which are indeed the infrastructures affecting the flow regime in the Lancang. In the lower Mekong basin (not considered in our spatial domain), the flow regime has been modified not only by hydropower reservoirs, but also by withdrawals for irrigation supply (Hoang et al., 2019). Looking forward, it would thus be interesting to extend the spatial domain of our model and study how these withdrawals could affect its parameterization. As the pervasiveness of water resources management in Earth system models expands, so too does the need for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms regulating the calibration process. The explicit representation of water reservoirs – and other infrastructure – is indeed likely to result in more realistic soil parameters, a hypothesis whose verification depends on the availability of observations about soil physical properties for large spatial domains. In turn, this highlights the importance of studies aimed to infer such properties from remotely sensed images (Chang and Islam, 2000; Chabrillat et al., 2019). A related topic that may also deserve future research is the robustness of these models with respect to changes in the operations or physical characteristics of dams. Variability in water and energy demand is a key driver for multiple management and planning interventions (e.g., modifications of the operating rules, construction on new storage), so it is paramount to know the extent to which models can still capture key hydrological processes once these modifications are in place. Overall, the findings of this study reinforce the message that water infrastructures – and their operational settings – play a key role in the reliability of a hydrological modeling exercise, like the quality of the hydro-meteorological data, the model structure, or the calibration process (Francés et al., 2007; Madsen, 2000). These findings gain further prominence if one considers the expected increase in hydropower development in several regions of the world (Zarfl et al., 2015).\n\nAbbaspour, K.

        "document": "Flood control reservoirs are typically managed through rule curves (i.e. target water levels) which control the storage and release timing of flood waters. Changes to rule curves are often contemplated and requested by various user groups and management agencies with no information available about the actual flood risk of such requests. Methods of estimating flood risk in reservoirs are not easily available to those unfamiliar with hydrological models that track water movement through a river basin. We developed a quantile regression model that uses readily available daily water-level data to estimate risk of spilling. Our model provided a relatively simple process for estimating the maximum applicable water level under a specific flood risk for any day of the year. This water level represents an upper-limit umbrella under which water levels can be operated in a variety of ways. Our model allows the visualization of water-level management under a user-specified flood risk and provides a framework for incorporating the effect of a changing environment on water-level management in reservoirs, but is not designed to replace existing hydrological models. The model can improve communication and collaboration among agencies responsible for managing natural resources dependent on reservoir water levels."

        "document": "Floods are among the natural disasters that pose significant threats to both urban and rural infrastructure, as well as the lives and properties of individuals. Streamflow prediction is essential for obtaining hydrological information and is critical for a variety of water resource projects. While precise daily streamflow predictions are indispensable, forecasting streamflow according to the limited data can help reduce computational time and enhance the efficacy of flood early warning systems. The purpose of this research is streamflow forecasting with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approach for the next 20 years. The peak streamflow extracted from the LSTM model was entered into HEC-RAS software and obtained flood zone maps and hazard maps. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed method was assessed through statistical analysis, including the coefficient of determination (R 2 ), Mean absolute error (MAE), Root mean square error (RMSE), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) and Mean bias error (MBE). In addition to the numerical comparison, the models were evaluated. Their performances were evaluated based on graphical plotting, including scatter plot, violin plot, box plot and Taylor diagram. In the chosen model (MD-8), the values RMSE (m 3 /s), R 2 , MAE, NSE, KGE and MBE are 4.57, 0.98, 2.56, 0.98, 0.94 and 0.17 during the training period, respectively, and 6.40, 0.92, 3.81, 0.89, 0.87 and 0.09 during the testing period, respectively. The simulation was tailored to the daily streamflow series of the Nesa river in Iran, which spans over 40 years. It is evaluated the results of generating flood zone maps using both the 2D HEC-RAS and LSTM models. The water inflow volume into the reservoir was found to be 76.3 million cubic meters, based on the peak streamflow predicted by the LSTM approach. The present model results demonstrate that the volume of water inflow into the reservoir for return periods of 25, 100 and 500 years were calculated as 76.26, 148.73 and 149.22 million cubic meters, respectively. Additionally, the Difference Flood Hazard (DFH) maps are obtained, illustrating the difference in flood hazard under various conditions.\n\nEnhancing flood forecasting with the integration of process-based and Deep Learning Models is a critical focus in studying natural disasters. Floods pose various destructive consequences that put everything associated with humans at risk1. Many deaths and significant harm to livelihoods, property, infrastructure, and utility services result from this danger2. The occurrence of floods is typically attributed to natural events, resulting from severe weather conditions that lead to the overflowing of main rivers and their smaller branches, inundating adjacent areas3. The flood phenomenon is also considered one of these natural disasters, which has increased in number and extent over the years due to human intervention. In general, the phenomenon of flood occurs when the soil, and plants cannot absorb rain or runoff from melting snow and the rivers do not have the capacity to pass these waters. The overflow of these waters from the main bed of the river and the occupation of the plains around it can damage residential houses, offices and facilities, ultimately putting human lives at risk. Although arid and semi-arid regions make up the majority of Iran, it has always been exposed to flood risks. Due to flood modeling and forecasting, it is necessary to identify the factors causing and intensifying it, investigate the damages, and prevent and reduce the damages4. Flood modeling involves a technical approach that can offer accurate details about the flood profile, encompassing factors that influence flooding, such as rainfall, surface waterflow, and characteristics of the watershed5. The Hydrologic Engineering Center’s River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) software is considered as one of the most widely used tools for investigating flood simulations because of its significantly improved capacity to simulate canals and natural rivers6,7. Flood modelling necessitates a two-dimensional modeling; in this aspect, HEC-RAS represents groundbreaking research in the subcontinent and throughout the world. The water surface elevation determines the accuracy of the flood map. Although GIS and HEC-RAS 1D models may be inadequate to portray actual circumstances, automated floodplain mapping and analysis using HEC-RAS (2D) will provide more efficient, effective, and consistent results8. In a research by Sarchani et al. in 2020, they combined flood study with one-dimensional and two-dimensional HEC-RAS on a river in Greece named Crete to calculate the flood risk map in the catchment area. To ensure the accuracy of parameters such as the Manning coefficient of the river, they used a simultaneous analysis method. The results of the simulation can be helpful in creating flood risk maps9. While this study focuses on natural flood dynamics, dam failure scenarios (e.g., structural breaches or overtopping) could exacerbate inundation risks downstream. For instance, in 2022, Hosseinzadeh-Tabrizi et al. utilized a 2D HEC-RAS model to simulate the flood downstream of the Sattar Khan Dam, located in the northwest of Iran. The importance of this issue is the location of Ahar city downstream of the dam. Their research investigated the population and infrastructure of this area based on two dam failure scenarios. The results indicated that certain population centers downstream of the dam area are at flooding risk in case of dam break. The study calculated the arrival time of the flood and the maximum velocity in the affected regions. The aim of their research was to aid in the development of a comprehensive crisis management plan10. In 2022, Mohammadi et al. assessed the performance of numerical simulations in replicating river flood zones within the Azarshahr Qushqura River area. They also contrasted the 1D and 2D hydraulic models of HEC-RAS. The flood flow hydraulic characteristics, such as the velocity and depth of the flow at various cross sections, were assessed. Findings indicated that the two-dimensional model HEC-RAS displayed the least error in the water surface level (flow depth) in comparison with other hydraulic parameters of flood flow, as opposed to the one-dimensional model11. In a study by Vashist and Singh in 2023, a 2D hydrodynamic model was utilized for charting flood inundation for the Krishna River. Flood maps were generated using Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) with different resolutions. The impact of alterations in upstream boundary data on the extent of the flooded area was also investigated in their study. The simulated outcomes obtained from the 12.5-m resolution DEM demonstrated reasonable agreement with the validation data and closely matched the documented inundated regions2. The Keser watershed was the focus of a 2023 research study, which involved numerical modeling of flood hydrographs. This was conducted to aid in disaster risk reduction and the efficient management of water resources, particularly for the development of an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for the Tugu Dam. This study focused on calculating peak discharge. Based on the calculations, the flood discharge calculated utilizing the HEC-HMS model was 451.1 m3/s. The values of peak discharge calculated using the Gamma, Nakayasu and Snyder methods were 410.4, 424.2 and 439.4 m3/s, respectively12. In 2023, Shaikh et al. evaluated the flood event of 2006 in the low-lying areas of Surat city, India, using the HEC-RAS model for 2D hydrodynamic modeling within a GIS framework. In this study, a 30-meter resolution digital elevation model of Surat city was obtained from SRTM data. The discharge hydrograph from the Ukai Dam during the flood event, along with normal depth, was considered as the upstream and downstream boundary conditions for the simulation. The simulated flood results, when compared to the observed flood mapping of 2006, showed correlation coefficient values of R2 = 0.96, NSE = 0.90, and RMSE = 0.66 m13. In 2024, El-Bagoury and Gad assessed the risks of flash floods, calculating the volume of flood discharge in two drainage basins in southeastern Egypt that had experienced several devastating floods. Their study revealed that the effects of floods caused by torrential rains were more severe in areas near the mouth of the Nile River. To mitigate these risks, they recommended the construction of five dams, each with a height of ten meters, to create a water storage lake14. In the last decade, information-based frameworks such as Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) approaches have attracted attention in the fields of hydrological studies and water management15. Numerous factors aided the development of DL in hydrology, which include: (a) availability of substantial amounts of information, (b) quick development in the concurrent processing systems with multi-core capabilities, GPU technology, (c) specific software frameworks including TensorFlow and keras that allow developing tiered deep learning structures without investigating complicated mathematical aspects, (d) effective optimization results attaining nearly optimal outcomes, and (e) enhanced regularization techniques to counteract overfitting16. The development of the LSTM model involved utilizing deep learning techniques, and it has been operationalized as a conventional machine learning method to forecast daily inflow. After that, it became very popular as one of the successful deep learners in the field of artificial neural networks. The term “deep learning” was first introduced to Descartes Machine Learning and Artificial Neural Networks by Eisenberg and her colleagues17. It should be noted that various discussions have been carried out regarding the use of machine learning (ML) models across different areas of hydrology and flow estimation18. Neural network approaches, such as LSTM, due to their consecutive structure, can exploit complex properties more efficiently than traditional machine learning models, assuming that adequate information is supplied19. Moreover, Liu et al.20 announced that the Long Short-Term Memory model, which features built-in storage, is capable of learning and retaining long-term connections in the input-output relationship across various climate conditions. Cheng et al.21 used ML algorithms to forecast long-term flow on both a daily and monthly basis. Neural network models, recurrent neural networks, and a robust technique for understanding time dynamics for an extended duration or capturing nonlinear correlations are used to predict flow in terms of daily and monthly rates associated with a prolonged duration. Findings of this study showed that the LSTM managed to advance daily flow predicting and would be useful in supporting a framework for decision processes for hydrological management. A recent study was conducted in the region of southwestern India called Kerala, which has an annual mean rainfall of approximately 3,000 mm, using deep neural networks. In this research, flood forecasting has been investigated using in-depth training. Forecasting was analyzed using meteorological data focusing on LSTM and RNN-GRU approaches and evaluated by RMSE and MAE criteria22. The long short-term memory (LSTM) network has been widely utilized due to its recurrent architecture and distinctive gating system. This approach has demonstrated significant potential in hydrological forecasting, including flood alerts and river level predictions23. Latif and Ahmed utilized deep learning and machine learning algorithms to predict the daily inflow of the Dukan Dam on the Zab River in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. They compared the performance of the deep learning algorithm with that of the enhanced Boosted Regression Tree (BRT). The results indicated that the root mean square error (RMSE) for the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model demonstrated significantly superior accuracy. The LSTM model exhibited high reliability and accuracy, making it a valuable tool for predictions24. Li et al.25 proposed anew hybrid method that merges traditional physical models with historical data to train LSTM networks. Using the NAM hydrological model and the HD hydraulic model, on the Jinhua basin in China to evaluate the effectiveness of LSTM models trained on different datasets. Results show that LSTM models trained on mixed datasets, particularly those with a simulated-to-measured data ratio of less than 2:1, perform better, achieving lower RMSE and MAE values. This hybrid model represents a significant advancement in flood forecasting, offering a viable solution to issues of computational efficiency and data scarcity. Dtissibe et al.16 has experienced on the Far-North region of Cameroon, flood prediction techniques in the area are mainly based on physical models and often produce inadequate outcomes. This study investigates the use of artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning and deep learning algorithms, to enhance flood forecasting. The research compares different models, such as one-dimensional convolutional neural networks, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Multi-Layer Perceptron, utilizing temperature and rainfall time series data as inputs. Performance is assessed using metrics like Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency and Root Mean Squared Error. The results show that the LSTM model excels in both short-term and long-term flood forecasting, exhibiting strong performance and generalization capabilities. Although the utilization of deep learning and LSTM model concepts has grown in popularity, an extensive discussion of deep learning concepts, methodologies, deployments, challenges, research deficiencies, and future possibilities and its combination with numerical models in hydrology is still lacking, which is the main reason for this review. Consequently, this study’s contribution is centered on employing the LSTM model to determine the daily peak streamflow and generate flood hazard maps through 2D HEC-RAS. Subsequently, the hazard maps depict potential flooding cases with return periods of 25, 100, and 500 years. By examining the flood hazard maps and the reservoir volume, it is tried to evaluate the capability of the reservoir to contain the flood volume.\n\nStreamflow prediction of the Nesa river which is located in the country of Iran between longitudes 55°17 to 61°11’E and latitudes 27°52° to 34°7°N with an area of 760 square kilometers is considered a pertinent case study to fulfill the aims of this investigation (Fig. 1). Additionally, the average altitude of the basin is about 2424.7 m. The length of the main river under study is about 22.4 km and the tributary is 12.4 km. The average annual rainfall in the area is 400 mm, and in most places it is less than 100 mm, with the highest amount is in the winter season. The maximum monthly rainfall is in January, February and March and the minimum is in July and August. The economic development of the Bam region greatly depends on the Nesa Dam and the flow downstream, which also has significant environmental and hydrological implications. Representation of the study area geographical location using ArcGIS 10.8 software. For the purpose of simulating streamflow forecasting, a range of daily discharge data spanning from 1978 to 2019 was gathered for this research. The total number of daily discharge data points is 14,976. Out of this total, 11,980 are selected as training data and 2996 are designated as test data. The Yalkhari station discharge values on a daily basis for 40 years. The Yalkhari hydrometric station is located 8 km from the Nesa Dam. Figure 2 shows the daily discharge during these years at this specific station. The years 1979 and 2002 lacked data and were therefore excluded from the calculations. The hydrological characteristics of the research area are presented in Table 1. In hydrology, the process of streamflow prediction is extremely important26,27. In this study, an investigation is conducted to assess how different forecasting models perform. The LSTM network is frequently utilized for handling time-series data due to its impressive memory capacity, giving it inherent benefits for processing such data28. Nowadays, significant progress has been achieved in methodologies and practical applications through the advancements of deep learning. According to the results obtained, it is obvious that the implementation of the created LSTM model demonstrates significant and improved accuracy, making it a dependable and trustworthy tool for forecasting streamflow and other hydrological factors. As mentioned earlier in the literature review, numerous research studies confirm the significance and reliability of LSTM, either on its own or when integrated with other algorithms in hybrid models24. LSTM has proven to be an effective tool for sequence modeling in various tasks, as it has the ability to retain past information for prediction purposes. In their study, Fu et al.29 introduced the outcomes of an improved LSTM model and demonstrated its clear benefits in handling continuous streamflow data during the arid periods in the Kelantan River, located in Malaysia. Rainfall and inflow were the input parameters of their study. The implementation of the model can be effective, depending on prior studies. the authors compared24 BRT and DL prediction models using daily discharge data from Dokan Dam, on the Lesser Zab River. Training and testing subsets were created from thedataset. The data was divided into two parts: 80% for training and 20% for testing. The authors16 utilized a dataset comprising historical temperature and rainfall time series from the Far-North region of Cameroon. Temperature and rainfall values were recorded weekly or monthly from 1980 to 2020. The dataset was divided as follows: 80% was used for model training and 20% for model testing. In the present study, the ratio of 80:20 was considered for the dataset. With repeated tests, the ratio of 80:20 was found to yield the best results for the dataset. Other ratios, such as 70:30, decreased the accuracy and negatively impacted the model’s performance. In this part, there is a description of the Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) used for forecasting streamflow and modeling 2D HEC-RAS, a widely used hydraulic model for flood zone mapping and inundation. The purpose of this research is to utilize a deep learning model for long-term forecasting and to integrate it with the HEC-RAS numerical model. This approach aims to assess potential measures for mitigating high-risk floods while considering the presence of a reservoir. By using deep learning and a large dataset, the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model was identified as suitable for sequential data analysis, particularly in tasks such as time series prediction, due to its superior performance in these contexts. Deep learning, as a subset of machine learning, is particularly effective for solving complex problems. Previous studies and analyses of time series data indicate that the LSTM model is the most effective solution for the specific needs of this research. It is important to note that deep neural networks, including LSTM, require substantial amounts of data and powerful hardware to process this data effectively in order to achieve optimal performance. Consequently, the LSTM model was selected as the primary model after thorough investigation. In the present study, the LSTM model was developed using Python and Keras. The model consists of four levels of neurons (200-100-80-30) and activation functions. The model underwent training for 100 epochs, after which it made predictions using the testing data. Nine different models (MD) have been proposed to choose the most accurate input parameter (Table 2). Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), suggested by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber30, is a modified version designed to address the limitations of the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and overcome the issues of gradient explosion or vanishing31. The LSTM model developed in the present study includes three layers: input, hidden, and output layers. The LSTM model’s design is shown in Fig. 332,33. The sequential input x = {x , x , …, x } and the output chain y = {y , y …, y } are linked by the forget door, which determines whether the current data should beforgotten or remembered. At a particular time stage t, the calculation can be performed in the following manner34: Where b is the forget door bias, W and W represent the forget weight matrix and the forget-hidden weight matrix, and H represents the nonlinear activation function. Tanh and ReLU are the most common choices for H activation in recursive networks. The parameter \\(\\:{\\:\\stackrel{\\sim}{\\text{c}}}_{\\text{t}}\\)memorizes the up-to-date data and the forget door f concludes the data updating. They are presented as follows: where W and W denote the weight matrix. The weights and biases are also displayed with the W and b symbol. The bias vectors for the input door and the cell state update are depicted sequentially as b and b . Afterward, the new state of the memory cell, c , is updated in the following manner: where c represents the previous state of the memory cell, and the * represents element-wise product. The output door handles the output activations at the end. The hidden layer, which is sent to a subsequent time stage, is defined as follows: where the output weight matrix is represented as w , b is the output door bias and w represents the output-concealed weight matrix. The procedure for the implementation of the LSTM model consists of the following steps;\n• To begin, the sequence data containing input parameters needs to be loaded, with the time steps aligned with the day value associated with streamflow. In LSTM, the model learns to remember relevant information from past time steps (or previous elements in the sequence) and uses that information to make predictions or generate output at the current time step. Each time step represents a moment in time or a specific position in the sequence and is typically represented as a column in the input data matrix.\n• Next, it’s time to split the training and testing data into separate partitions. In the present study, the proposed LSTM model has been trained on 80% of the time-series data, and 20% of the time-series data has been chosen to test the mFig. Fig. 4. The Yalkhari station discharge values on a daily basis for 40 years.\n• The next step involves normalizing the data in order to achieve a zero mean and unit variance, which will improve the fitting and prevent the training from diverging.\n• Finally, the responses and predictors need to be prepared. After repeated stages, different hyper-parameters are set. The hyper-parameters used in the LSTM model are presented in Table 3 as follows: Table 3 The presentation of Hyper-parameters used in the LSTM. Performance evaluation criteria in hydrological studies can be classified into various categories, each with corresponding mathematical relationships. To assess the performance and accuracy of the model, a range of statistical and hydrological criteria were utilized to derive quantitative results. These include: the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), the Nash Sutcliffe model Efficiency coefficient (NSE), Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) and Mean bias error (MBE), which were employed to evaluate the performance and accuracy of the model. In an ideal model, the MAE should be minimized and close to zero, while the R2 should be maximized and close to one. This indicates that the model accounts for a considerable amount of the variance in the data. These criteria are calculated using the following Eqs35,36. In which x and y represent the observational and computational values in the chronological step of i, respectively. N denotes the total number steps, while x and y represent the average computational and observational values, respectively, in the given order. The peak discharges for the basin, in addition to the land use maps, were utilized as inputs for the 2D HEC-RAS approach, which allowed the simulation of the variability and distribution of the flow pathway. The model then generated flood velocity and depth maps to determine the regions that were flooded and determine locations with hazards14. The two-dimensional HEC-RAS model has been employed for the analysis of reservoir operations37, and to enhance the urban flood risk assessment maps38. The 2D mesh’s flow field is computed using the diffusion wave approximation approach, which results in a shorter computation time and a reduction in the possibility of model instability in comparison to the shallow water Eqs14,39. The computational domain is divided into grid cells, and HEC-RAS produces a comprehensive hydraulic property table for all cells. The model’s water surface profiles, created with various hydraulic design elements, can assist decision-makers in investing resources to better prepare for disasters and enhance the life quality. This is achieved by analyzing the severity of flooding and flood inundation areas to improve the level of preparedness. In this research, the diffusion wave equations were used in 2D HEC-RAS v 6.5 Beta, ArcGIS v 10.8 was utilized to create flood depth maps. In the application of the HEC-RAS model, geometric data and flow data are two fundamental components. Creating geometric data, which determines the river channel, longitudinal profile of the river, left and right banks of the floodplain, and drawing the cross-section and flow direction, is the first step in simulating the flood for different return periods using the HEC-RAS model. Topographic maps and DEM are utilized to transfer the output to the HEC-RAS software. Subsequently, the RAS mapper tool is utilized to obtain the extent of flood protection and hazard maps. The necessity of flood study in the period of different returns is to measure or estimate the magnitude of peak flows. By analyzing flood frequency based on instantaneous maximum values and probability distribution functions, the estimated best instantaneous maximum discharge can be determined. The river bed boundary is determined using topographic maps, GIS, and HEC-RAS 2D. Floodplain maps offer valuable information about the flood’s characteristics and its impact on the floodplain, allowing for timely warnings to be issued during periods of flood risk. The two-dimensional unsteady HEC-RAS model was established by integrating the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the research area into the RAS Mapper to generate the topographicalrepresentation. For the 30-meter resolution DEM, 31,428 cells were produced for cell sizes dx and dy equal to 30 m and Manning’s roughness coefficient (n) as 0.033. Each mesh should have only one computation point. The model has been updated with a new geometry file for the terrain layer geometry data. The model development also requires 2D surface roughness, Boundary Conditions (BCs), and unsteady flow data as other parameters. The input for surface roughness includes the Manning’s roughness coefficient. To generate the mesh and map inundation, a 2D flow area is specified for the terrain by outlining a polygon around the study area involving all the relevant reaches. The flow area parameters were used to generate a computational mesh in the 2D flow area. Figure 5 displays the two-dimensional flow area that was generated using a 30-meter DEM. During flood simulation, the hydraulic model is calibrated by varying Manning’s coefficient for flood zones and channels. Upon completing mesh generation, boundary conditions are applied to the 2D flow area for performing unsteady flow analysis. Three boundary conditions, one downstream and two upstream, have been applied close to the 2D flow region as displayed in Fig. 5. All necessary details are provided by flow data that is considered for the unsteady analysis of the flow. For the boundary condition, a time series of discharge in the form of a hydrograph (an input hydrograph) has been considered in the simulation. 2D area plan and boundary conditions of the Nesa River using HEC-RAS v 6.5 Beta software. Based on discharge data from the Yalkhari Hydrometric Station, the best fitting distribution was determined according to three criteria: Anderson-Darling, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, and Kai-Squire for return periods of 2, 25, 100, 500, and 1000 estimates. After completing the data inputs, The HEC-RAS model was employed for the purpose of conducting an extensive analysis of the flow. The model generated a comprehensive report of the analysis, which included information on the flow depth, discharge values at each cross section, and other simulation details. The examination of the region inundated under various return-period flood events is based on the peak flows derived from frequency analysis executed through the utilization of Easyfit and HEC-HMS v 4.10 software. The maximum instantaneous discharges at the Nesa river for different periods were obtained using the Gamma distribution, as presented in Table 4. To run the 2D HEC-RAS model, programs including the unsteady flow simulation, geometry preprocessor, floodplain mapping, postprocessor, and simulation period should be determined for the evaluation of unsteady flow. Computational settings include the hydrograph output interval, computation interval, and mesh generation for a 30 m resolution DEM terrain layer and a 2D area flow with mesh provided for the simulations. The calculation interval is an important parameter in unsteady flow calculations. It should be selected in a way that ensures accuracy and stability according to the Courant condition, and produces satisfactory results40. In order to specify the optimal computation interval and maintain stability and accuracy, the computation interval was set to 5 min. While this study utilized ground-based hydrological data, future work could incorporate remote sensing datasets (e.g., satellite-derived rainfall from GPM or topographic data from LiDAR) to enhance spatial resolution and real-time flood monitoring. Such integration could refine DEM accuracy and provide dynamic inputs for LSTM models. As a result, applying remote sensing datasets could increase the accuracy of LSTM prediction results.\n\nAs previously discussed, the primary research question of this paper is how to predict the streamflow based on the time series dataset using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, as well as the assessment of flood zones and inundation resulting from HEC-RAS 2D. Nine different models were developed using daily streamflow data with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which generated predictions for the next 20 years. Additional to the statistical parameters, the correctness of the investigated models (MD-2 and MD-8) and another models were validated using the scatter plot, violin plot and box plot and Taylor diagrams. Comparisons and analyses were conducted between the MD-2 and the best-performing model (MD-8). Finally, MD-9 was chosen as the research target. Its model can be extended for practical applications. A comparison of LSTM between MD-2 and MD-8 with LSTM streamflow forecasts was provided in the analysis. The results show that the deep learning models demonstrate good streamflow prediction ability. This attribute makes deep learning have great potential in hydrological prediction and analysis. The MD-8 model proposed in this paper has fairly high prediction accuracy and also provides a reliable prediction interval. Based on the literature review, in 2020, Zhu et al. carried out a study, and the findings demonstrated that the hybrid LSTM integrated with the Gaussian process would improve forecasting precision and offer a flexible prediction interval, which is extremely important for planning and administration in water resources. This conclusion is similar to the results of the present study44. In another investigation in 202324, , the LSTM model was created and utilized on the Dokan dam dataset for predicting daily reservoir inflow. The chosen input variable was the daily reservoir inflow. According to the LSTM results, regarding the training dataset, RMSE = 34.1, R² = 0.98, and NSE = 0.98, respectively. For the testing dataset, RMSE = 19.1, R² = 0.99, and NSE = 0.98, respectively. This illustrates the performance of the testing set for predicting daily reservoir inflow using the developed LSTM method. It is to be mentioned that in the present study, the statistical analysis gave more reasonably results. While the current study focuses on historical streamflow data, climate change could significantly alter rainfall patterns and flood frequencies in the Nesa River basin. For instance, increased precipitation intensity, as projected in arid regions like Iran may amplify flood risks. Future iterations of this model could integrate climate projections to assess long-term reservoir capacity and floodplain management under changing climatic conditions. Box plot and violin plot are both powerful tools for data analysis. In Fig. 9, the box plot displays the distribution and dispersion of data by showing the median, quartiles, and potential outliers, based on the maximum and minimum values. The standard deviation of the models MD-2 and MD-8 related to testing data varies between 22.16 and 20.87, with a correlation between 0.86 and 0.92, and for training data varies between 27.94 and 32.26, with a correlation between 0.85 and 0.98. Theseplots in Fig. 9 (b, h) show that MD-8 is able to predict daily flow better than MD-2, with predictions closer to observations and a correlation of 0.92 for the test data and a correlation of 0.98 for the training data. As well as, a Taylor diagram and a violin plot provide a deeper understanding of the data distribution by combining a box plot with a density plot, allowing for a visualization of the data’s distribution shape along with its summary statistics. The MD-8 model captured the values better during the training than the other models. The performance of the MD-9 model was similar to that of the MD-8. The statistical indicators in MD-8 confirm that it is suitable for flow prediction. The qualitative performance evaluation of the models was achieved by visual observations such as Taylor diagram, scatter plot, violin plot and box plot, and quantitative evaluations were carried out using different statistical and hydrological performance indices, namely, root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), the Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (NSE), the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE), Mean bias error (MBE) were employed to evaluate the performance and accuracy of the model. After obtaining the predicted daily streamflow from the LSTM model, the volume of water inflow into the reservoir was 76.3 million cubic meters, and for return periods of 25, 100, and 500 years, calculations were made. In the following, the difference flood hazard (DFH) revealed that many parts of the river are serpentine, necessitating further study in this locality.\n\nThis research was conducted with the aim of flood forecasting and risk assessment, as well as determining the vulnerability of the Nesa River to floods. Data accumulated from the Nesa River basin over a period of 40 years has been split into two sets for training and testing purposes. The LSTM model was applied to predict streamflow for the next 20 years. The peak streamflow extracted from the LSTM model was then inputted into the 2D HEC-RAS software to generate flood zone maps and hazard maps. Regarding to evaluate the performance of the present model, two statistical criteria including MAE and R2 were calculated for both the training and test datasets. The examination of the region inundated during various return-period flood events is informed by the peak discharge values derived from frequency analysis performed using Easyfit and HEC-HMS software. The maximum instantaneous discharges at Nesa river for different periods were obtained using the Gamma distribution. Flood modeling was done using 2D HEC-RAS, and the required hydraulic parameters (depth, velocity, etc.) were extracted from this model. Using these parameters and following the existing standard in this field, flood zoning and flood hazard maps were prepared. To ensure graphical congruence of the fulfillment of different methods, observed and predicted daily streamflow data were applied to create scatter plots and time series graphs. The results of generating flood zone maps using both the 2D HEC-RAS and LSTM approaches were evaluated. Results indicate that the volume of water inflow into the reservoir 76.3 million cubic meters by the LSTM model and for return periods of 25, 100 and 500 years were calculated as 76.26, 148.73 and 149.22 million cubic meters, respectively. The results show that the volume of water inflow into the reservoir is 76.3 million cubic meters according to the LSTM model. The calculated values for return periods of 25, 100, and 500 years are 76.26, 148.73, and 149.22 million cubic meters, respectively. The surface area under the flood is 9.11, 19.76, and 20.96 square kilometers, respectively. The arrival time of the flood to the reservoir is about 22 h for the return periods of 100 and 500 years. Examining the flood hazard maps shows that based on the ADRH method, the flood is classified as H6, which means it is unsafe for people and vehicles. All types of buildings are regarded as susceptible to failure. In the following, the Difference Flood Hazard (DFH) maps illustrate that the most affected areas are the banks of this river, the parts of the main channel, and the spiral parts of the river. According to the DFH map, the villages around the river are at risk of flooding. However, due to the mountainous terrain of the area, a significant portion of the flood volume is stored in the reservoir to prevent damage to the downstream areas. Finally, the present study indicated that LSTM methods are capable of predicting daily streamflow in this study field. Consequently, the models are deemed appropriate for forecasting streamflow and, as a result, for the effective management of flood events. The utilization of deep learning frameworks in conjunction with hydrological models ought to be augmented to enhance the efficacy of long-term streamflow predictions. CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) can be implemented on spatiotemporal data, such as satellite imagery of flood-prone areas, to identify patterns and predict flood occurrences. BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) are other deep learning models recommended for integration with hydrological assessments to improve predictive performance in flood forecasting. Although LSTM was selected for its proven efficacy in sequential data, alternative architectures like GRU or hybrid models (e.g., CNN-LSTM) could further validate our results. For example, GRUs offer computational efficiency, while CNNs excel at spatial feature extraction from raster data. Future studies may explore these models to assess robustness across diverse hydrological regimes. Together, these technologies create a robust framework that enhances the accuracy of flood predictions, ultimately aiding in the mitigation of flood impacts. The use of numerical models, such as SWAT and HEC-HMS, in combination with various deep learning algorithms, such as BiLSTM and GRU, can provide valuable information for researchers, especially given the lack of information and limitations in this area. It is to be mentioned that the exact effects of climate change can be considered as a suggestion for further research."

        "document": "A flood forecasting system commonly consists of at least two essential components, that is, a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model to provide rainfall forecasts and a hydrological/hydraulic model to predict the hydrological response. While being widely used for flood forecasting, hydrological models only provide a simplified representation of the physical processes of flooding due to negligence of strict momentum conservation. They cannot reliably predict the highly transient flooding process from intense rainfall, in which case a fully 2-D hydrodynamic model is required. Due to high computational demand, hydrodynamic models have not been exploited to support real-time flood forecasting across a large catchment at sufficiently high resolution. To fill the current research and practical gaps, this work develops a new forecasting system by coupling a graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerated hydrodynamic model with NWP products to provide high-resolution, catchment-scale forecasting of rainfall-runoff and flooding processes induced by intense rainfall. The performance of this new forecasting system is tested and confirmed by applying it to “forecast” an extreme flood event across a 2,500-km 2 catchment at 10-m resolution. Quantitative comparisons are made between the numerical predictions and field measurements in terms of water level and flood extent. To produce simulation results comparing well with the observations, the new flood forecasting system provides 34 hr of lead time when the weather forecasts are available 36 hr beforehand. Numerical experiments further confirm that uncertainties from the rainfall inputs are not amplified by the hydrodynamic model toward the final flood forecasting outputs in this case.\n\nFlooding is one of the most frequent and widely distributed natural hazards, causing significant losses to human lives and properties every year across the world (Balica et al., 2013). As a result of climate change, more intense precipitation is expected in the warmer future (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2014; Kendon et al., 2012), which may consequently trigger more extreme rainfall-induced flood events and increase flood risk. Flood forecasting is an effective means to provide timely hazard information to relevant government decision-makers and practitioners as well as those residents at risk, which plays an important role in flood risk reduction (Carsell et al., 2004). A lot of effort has been made in the development of forecasting systems for different types of floods, such as fluvial, coastal (Saleh et al., 2017), flash (Hapuarachchi et al., 2011), and snowmelt floods (Blöschl et al., 2008). Regardless of the type of floods being considered, a complete flood forecasting system normally includes at least two components, that is, a model to predict the sources/drivers of flooding, such as precipitation, river flow, and storm surge, and a hydrological or hydraulic model to efficiently simulate the catchment response and flooding processes along the river networks and in the floodplains. For fluvial flooding, an accurate numerical weather prediction (NWP) model is an essential component of a flood forecasting system to provide reliable prediction of rainfall. NWP models predict the physical processes in the atmosphere using numerical methods that solve the 3-D partial differential equations derived from the relevant physical laws (de Roo et al., 2003). Prior to 1990s, due to the restrictions in computational power, large-scale (global or continental) NWP models were normally run at coarse resolutions of >100 km. In the last few decades, following the improved scientific understanding of weather processes and significant technical breakthroughs in computing technologies, it has now become a common practice to run large-scale NWP models on government-funded supercomputers at ~10-km horizontal resolution. A number of weather service centers across the globe develop and operate these large-scale high-resolution NWP models to provide weather forecasts, for example, the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) (Palmer et al., 1990), the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) (Gauthier et al., 2007), and the U.S. National Weather Service (Fread et al., 1995). These NWP models and their products have been widely used in operational large/medium-scale and short/long-term flood forecasting platforms, such as the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS) (Bartholmes et al., 2009; Thielen et al., 2009) and the Advanced Hydrological Prediction Services (AHPS) (Mcenery et al., 2005) to provide flood forecasts for Europe and the United States. However, for intense and advective rainfall featured with clear spatial heterogeneity, the resolution provided by these large-scale NWP models is still inadequate and higher-resolution NWP forecasts are needed to resolve the local atmospheric and geographical conditions to support more reliable weather and flood forecasting. Certain regional and short-range models have been developed and operated at kilometer level grids using outputs from the global models as boundary conditions. For example, in the United Kingdom, a unified model (UM) covering the British Isles has been operating for decades by the U.K. Met Office at low resolution for climate predictions and high resolution for regional NWP (Davies et al., 2005). One version of the UM is the U.K. Variable (UKV) resolution model running nationally on a 1.5-km grid for the majority of the domain and stretching to 4 km along the edges. The high-resolution UKV model represents convective processes explicitly rather than parameterizing them like in the global models. It effectively reflects and captures the effects of localized domain features (e.g., mountains) on rainfall patterns. These are all crucial for reliably forecasting intense rainfall. The performance of the UKV model for rainfall forecasting has been significantly improved, compared with the coarse-resolution models (Kendon et al., 2012; Mittermaier & Csima, 2017). The advances in high-resolution NWP provide a great opportunity to substantially improve the current practice in forecasting floods from intense rainfall, which is still a great challenge in research and practice (Bauer et al., 2015). Prediction of catchment response and the flooding processes induced by rainfall is another essential component in an effective fluvial flood forecasting system, which may involve the use of a wide variety of hydrological or hydraulic/hydrodynamic models (Campolo et al., 1999; Chau et al., 2005; Chiang et al., 2007; Nayak et al., 2005). In addition to those overly simplified statistical approaches, hydrological models are commonly used to predict flooding at a catchment scale (Blöschl et al., 2008; Garrote & Bras, 1995; J. Li et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2005). The output of a hydrological model is typically time series of flow rate in the river channels. Therefore, a hydrological model is usually coupled with a hydraulic model to predict flood inundation if prediction of detailed flood impact outside the river channels is expected (Yamazaki et al., 2011). Hydraulic inundation models are based on the numerical solutions to the full 2-D shallow water equations (hydrodynamic models) or one of their simplified forms (e.g., diffusion-wave models and kinematic-wave models) (da Paz et al., 2011). When it is necessary, a 1-D river routing model may also be used to simulate the flow processes inside river channels and propagate the upstream flood hydrograph predicted by a hydrological model to downstream, which is then coupled with an inundation model to predict flood impact (Chatterjee et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2012; Paiva et al., 2011). However, simulation of floodplain inundation using 2-D models is computationally expensive, and direct prediction of detailed floodplain hydrodynamics in real time is still not a common practice in an operational flood forecasting system. Therefore, in large-scale operational flood forecasting systems, hydrological models are currently the dominant choice for flood predictions (Kauffeldt et al., 2016). However, a single hydrological model may not be adequate to simulate the flooding process induced by different rainfall events in certain catchments because models calibrated for low flows may not perform well in simulating high flows, and vice versa (Unduche et al., 2018). Moreover, hydrological models are commonly not capable of forecasting the spreading flood dynamics and extents which are important for risk mitigation, and so operational flood forecasting schemes usually involve coupling a hydrological model with hydraulic/hydrodynamic models or their outputs. For example, the Grid-to-Grid (G2G) model (Bell et al., 2007) adopted in the U.K.'s National Flood Forecasting System (NFFS) is not able to predict detailed flood extent and must be integrated with off-line flood simulation results obtained using hydrodynamic models to estimate flood impact. Furthermore, hydrological models do not impose strict momentum conservation in the governing equations and therefore are not able to predict the physical processes of transient flood waves induced by intense rainfall with the required level of accuracy. In this case, a hydrodynamic model is required to reliably predict the physical processes of flooding and output spatially and temporally varying water depth and velocity in the model domain (Andreadis et al., 2007; Mignot et al., 2006; Testa et al., 2007), which can be then used to quantify flood impact and inform risk reduction. But the computational constraint of hydrodynamic models hinders their wider application in large-scale flood forecasting. Following the recent advances in the relevant scientific and technological fields (e.g., data acquisition and high-performance computing), the performance of full hydrodynamic models has been significantly improved in the last decade (Teng et al., 2017). It has been now technically feasible to simulate flood dynamics in large catchments using the state-of-the-art high-performance hydrodynamic models (Sanders et al., 2010). More recently, the high-performance computing power provided by modern graphics processing units (GPUs) has led to a step change in the flood modeling practice (e.g., Smith & Liang, 2013). We are now able to simulate the detailed dynamics of a flood event at a high spatial resolution across an entire city/catchment involving tens of millions of computational cells in real time (Liang et al., 2016; Xia et al., 2019). However, the exploitation of these latest high-performance flood modeling technologies in flood risk assessment and forecasting is still at an embryonic stage, and more research effort is needed (e.g., Flack et al., 2019; Morsy et al., 2018). With increasing frequency of intense rainfall in the current and future climate scenarios (Thompson et al., 2017), more extreme flood events are expected. The traditional flood forecasting systems based on hydrological models are proved to be mostly reliable on slow-varying catchment response and flooding processes following prolonged rainfall. It is therefore necessary and desirable to exploit the latest high-performance modeling technology and develop a flood forecasting system by directly coupling with a fully hydrodynamic model to forecast the detailed flood dynamics and impact induced by intense rainfall. Driven by the NWP outputs from the UKV model, this paper presents an innovative flood forecasting system that adopts a high-performance fully 2-D hydrodynamic model to predict the full-scale flooding processes from rainfall to inundation. The performance of the proposed forecasting system is tested and confirmed by implementation in a 2,500-km2 domain covering the whole Eden Catchment in England to “forecast” the 2015 Storm Desmond flood event.\n\nThe structure of the proposed flood forecasting system is illustrated in Figure 1, in which the High-Performance Integrated Hydrodynamic Modelling System (HiPIMS) (Xia et al., 2019) is driven by the UKV rainfall forecasts to predict the full-scale flooding processes across a predefined simulation domain (e.g., a catchment or a city). A high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) of the domain is required to set up HiPIMS for flood simulation. Human-related interventions, for example, flood defenses, are considered when processing the topographic data to create the final DEM. Other relevant datasets including land cover information and soil properties are also required to estimate model parameters. Initial conditions (water depth and velocities in the computational domain) for starting a simulation may be generated by prerunning the model using antecedent rainfall data from observations or UKV predictions. If available, river gauge measurements and other field observations should be used to calibrate and validate the model. The HiPIMS-based flood forecasting system will produce temporal-spatial varying flood depths and velocities across the entire simulation domain, which can then be further processed to produce inundation maps and other necessary flood information for issuing flood warnings. The results can be also used to support flood risk analysis by superimposing the relevant vulnerability and exposure data. NWP products from the UKV model (Davies et al., 2005) are used in this work to drive HiPIMS for real-time flood forecasting. Covering Great Britain and Ireland at a resolution of 1.5 km over the central domain and 4 km along the edges (Tang et al., 2013), the UKV model is the highest-resolution model available for short-range weather forecasting in the U.K. and is able to represent most of the convective dynamics without using a convection parameterization scheme (Lean et al., 2008). The operational UKV model has been run in real time since 2010 by the U.K. Met Office, using 3-hourly cycling 3-D variational Data Assimilation (3D-Var) to generate weather forecasts up to 36 hr ahead for release at every 6 hr (Ballard et al., 2016). The UKV model outputs are deposited at the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA) and stored as binary files in the Met Office postprocessing format, which can be converted into the NetCDF format via an open software tool XCONV. The rainfall forecast data are output at gridded format on a rotated latitude-longitude projected coordinate system and can be transformed to the Ordnance Survey National Grid (BNG) reference system at a spatial resolution of approximately 1.5 km, which can be directly used as precipitation inputs to drive HiPIMS for flood simulation. where denotes the time, and are the two Cartesian coordinates, is the vector containing the conserved flow variables, f and g are the flux vectors in the and directions, and , , and are the source term vectors representing rainfall and infiltration rates, bed slope, and friction effect, respectively. The vector terms are given by where is the water depth, and are, respectively, the two depth-averaged velocity components in the and directions, represents the rainfall rate, is the infiltration rate, is the water density, is the acceleration due to gravity, and and are the frictional stresses estimated using the Manning formula: where is the friction coefficient with n being the Manning coefficient. In a flood event, water depth is generally much smaller than the horizontal inundation extent, and the flow hydrodynamics can be mathematically described by the 2-D depth-averaged shallow water equations (SWEs). In a matrix form, the SWEs may be written aswheredenotes the time,andare the two Cartesian coordinates,is the vector containing the conserved flow variables,andare the flux vectors in theanddirections, and, andare the source term vectors representing rainfall and infiltration rates, bed slope, and friction effect, respectively.

Apart from the Manning coefficient, infiltration rate is another parameter that may influence the simulation results especially when the catchment under consideration is dry. In HiPIMS, infiltration is considered using the Green-Ampt model with the infiltration rate estimated using the following formula:whereis the cumulative infiltrated depth,is the effective hydraulic conductivity,is the metric suction head at the wetting front,is the saturated volumetric water content, andis the initial volumetric water content. To predict the transient and complex flow hydrodynamics across different flow regimes that may occur during a flood event induced by intense rainfall, HiPIMS solves the above governing equations using a Godunov-type finite volume numerical scheme as presented in Liang (2010). The numerical scheme has since been further improved by Xia et al. (2017) and Xia and Liang (2018) for accurate and stable simulation of rainfall-induced overland flows and other flooding processes across an entire catchment, including urbanized areas (Liang & Smith, 2015; Q. Li et al., 2020). The model uses a uniform grid to represent the topographic features of the model domain, consistent with the raster grid of the DEM. Since HiPIMS adopts an overall explicit numerical method, the time step of a simulation is controlled by the CFL condition that is related to both cell size and flow velocity (Xia et al., 2019). In order to substantially improve the computational efficiency for large-scale simulations and real-time forecasting, HiPIMS is implemented and runs on multiple GPUs. GPUs were originally designed to render high-resolution images and videos but have been extensively exploited in scientific computing to speed up sophisticated computational fluid dynamics models in the last decade. Compared with the central processing units (CPUs), GPUs are better suited for repetitive and highly parallel computational tasks and can be used for flexibly performing operations on multiple sets of data. Several parallel computing platforms such as CUDA and OpenCL have been developed to support the development of models to take advantage of the computational power of GPUs (Rawls et al., 1983). In this work, HiPIMS is developed using CUDA to facilitate large-scale flood simulations on NVIDIA GPUs. To enable efficient flood modeling on multiple GPUs, HiPIMS adopts the CUDA block decomposition method as introduced in Sætra and Brodtkorb (2012) to divide the whole computational domain to generate stripe-like subdomains consisting of rows of cells. Computational tasks on each of the subdomains are carried out separately on different GPUs with exchange of data occurring at the overlapping boundary cells at every time step. The time step in each subdomain is decided according to the CFL condition that is related to the maximum velocity and size of the grid cells. The strategy to ease the data exchange process and unify the temporal resolution of flood calculation across the global domain is to adopt the smallest time step returned from the subdomains and synchronize it as the single global time step. The adoptation of a single global time step removes the requirements of sophisticated model implementation and extra machine memory and will not affect the overall simulation efficiency of the model. The UKV model is currently operated in real time by the U.K. Met Office to produce 36-hr weather forecasts that are released at every 6 hr. A monitoring module is running to monitor the predicted rainfall pattern inside the user-defined domain and download the NWP products from the UKV model once new output data are generated. Based on the forecasted 36-hr accumulated rainfall, a “warning” threshold will be established for the flood forecasting system. The “warning” threshold is empirically selected according to the historical flood records and rainfall observations in the selected catchment to cover potential floods. Once the total rainfall or highest half-hourly rainfall intensity of a 36-hr rainfall forecast is above the warning threshold, HiPIMS will be activated to run for at least 36 hr until the end of the flooding event, for example, when the water level in river gauges falls back to the normal stages. The HiPIMS outputs in terms of flood depths and velocities can be released at any moment during a simulation. The instant output is transferred into a KML file and can be visualized in real time on Google Earth or any open-street maps to show flood inundation and impacted areas, for example, buildings, roads, and farmlands. The predicted maximum flood depth and extent for the forecasted event are also output once a simulation is completed, which can be used to estimate potential flood impact/risk.\n\nThe new flood forecasting system is applied to “forecast” a severe flood event induced by the 2015 Desmond storm in the Eden Catchment, England. The 2,500-km2 computational domain covering the whole Eden is represented using a DEM of 10-m spatial resolution to support 2-D hydrodynamic flood simulation. This essentially creates a uniform grid with 25 million computational nodes. As shown in Figure 2, the Eden Catchment is located in the northwest of England with an approximate area of 2,400 km2. The main watercourse in the catchment is the 145-km-long River Eden, which flows from the southeast to the northwest. River Eden has four main tributaries, the Caldew, Petteril, Eamont, and Irthing. Eden is a relatively wet catchment with an annual average rainfall of over 2,800 mm, 3 times of the annual average in England. The largest human settlement in the catchment is Carlisle, which is located at the downstream end of the Eden and has 75,000 residents, consisting of one third of the total population of the study catchment. Carlisle is not only an economic and industrial center of Northern England adjacent to the Scottish Borders but also a popular tourist destination due to its rich Roman heritage and the nearby Lake District National Park (Environment Agency, 2016). (left panel) The Eden Catchment and its location in Britain. The River Eden is 145 km long, and the average and maximum discharges at Sheepmount are 51.82 and 1,700 m3/s, respectively. (right panel) The city of Carlisle in the lower Eden catchment, covered by the investigated flood extent due to Storm Desmond in December 2015. The Eden Catchment is a rapid response catchment subject to frequent fluvial flooding due to its steep topography in the upstream region. The downstream area, including Carlisle, has experienced many serious floods in its history. For example, the devastating floods in January 2005 and December 2015 both brought significant damage to the city. The postevent survey of the flooded area for the December 2015 event is also illustrated in Figure 2. A reliable flood forecasting and warning system is clearly imperative for the area to mitigate flood risk and improve resilience. Data as required by the proposed flood forecasting system include topographical data, land cover maps, and gridded rainfall forecasts. Rainfall observations including gauge records and radar detected data are also necessary to calibrate and validate the weather forecasts. Digital Terrain Model (DTM) representing the height of bare earth surface is the background topographical data and may be acquired from the Digimap OS Terrain 5-m DTM data set (Link 1 in Appendix A). LIDAR Composite Digital Surface Model (DSM), which may be downloaded from the U.K. Environment Agency (EA) website (Link 2 in Appendix A), is merged with the DTM to reflect buildings and key infrastructure (e.g., flood defenses). Neither of these two digital elevation data sets provide accurate underwater bathymetric information although it is essential for reliable simulation of flow dynamics along river channels. Therefore, the EA surveyed river cross-section data sets covering the downstream river courses are integrated to further improve the final DEM. Land cover information is useful for estimating and adjusting friction and infiltration coefficients in HiPIMS. Land cover information in the study area can be subtracted from the 2015 U.K. Land Cover Map provided by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) (Link 3 in Appendix A). It is a parcel-based land cover map created by classifying satellite data into 21 classes (Rowland et al., 2017), available at a spatial resolution of up to 25 m for the whole United Kingdom. Grassland is the predominant land cover type (72.4%) in the Eden Catchment, and urban and suburban areas only account for 2.7% of the total catchment area. The rainfall rate forecasted by the UKV model is a grid-based data set at 1.5-km spatial resolution and 15-min temporal resolution. The Met Office NIMROD system provides gridded radar rainfall data that are calibrated to give the best possible estimation of surface precipitation rate at 1-km spatial resolution and 5-min temporal resolution, which is available in the CEDA archive (Link 4 in Appendix A). It is produced based on radar records and processed using optimized quality control and correction procedures (Met Office, 2003). Therefore, the NIMROD radar data are treated in this work as the reliable/accurate rainfall observations on the ground. The grid-based rainfall forecasts are also compared with the point-based rainfall observations recorded in the surface weather stations, available from the Met Office Integrated Data Archive System (MIDAS). In the Eden Catchment, five stations, as shown in Figure 2, have hourly rainfall records, which can be downloaded from the CEDA archive. River gauge measurements and postevent investigations provide crucial data to evaluate the flood forecasting results and confirm the performance of the hydrodynamic model. The EA flood-monitoring application programming interface (API) provides near real-time measurements of water level and flow rate for rivers across England (Link 5 in Appendix A), and 16 river gauge stations are available in the Eden Catchment (as shown in Figure 2). The EA Historic Flood Map data set provides records of flood extents for historical events in England (Link 6 in Appendix A). These data sets provide valuable information to evaluate the performance of the model in predicting water level hydrographs and inundation extents.\n\nIn this section, the proposed flood forecasting system set up for the Eden Catchment is tested by reforecasting a severe flood event that occurred on 6 December 2015. The event was caused by the intense rainfall brought by Storm Desmond from 4 to 7 December. The amounts of rainfall in one day and two consecutive days both set new historical records in the catchment, as did the water levels and flow rates at some river gauges, such as Sheepmount, on the River Eden (Environment Agency, 2016). The extreme rainfall event led to severe flooding across the catchment, bringing widespread damage and impact to the city of Carlisle. To validate the current flood forecasting system, numerical rainfall predictions produced by the UKV model are first compared with radar and gauge observations, and the model outputs from HiPIMS driven by radar rainfall inputs are evaluated against the observed flood extent and measured water levels. Then the performance of the flood forecasting system is demonstrated by directly using the UKV numerical rainfall predictions as the model inputs. A computer server equipped with 8 × NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPUs is fully exploited to run the hydrodynamic simulations. The UKV rainfall predictions are compared first with the NIMROD radar rainfall records for the selected event. The catchment experienced the most intense rainfall from 21:00 on 4 December to 9:00 on 6 December 2015. The grid-based 36-hr accumulated radar rainfall and forecasted rainfall are plotted and compared in Figure 3. The high-intensity zone (the region appears in blue on the maps) of the UKV forecasted rainfall is slightly askew to the northeast direction, compared with the radar rainfall. The heavy rainfall belt forecasted by the UKV model is located more toward the Eden Catchment as outlined by the red line, which essentially means the UKV model overpredicts the rainfall in the catchment. This is further confirmed by the box plots of hourly rainfall rates for all grid cells inside the catchment, as shown in Figure 4. The box plots effectively illustrate the statistical behavior of rainfall rates throughout the 36-hr duration: Box height indicates the spatial variation of rainfall rates. Clearly, the UKV forecasted rainfall is spatially more divergent than the NIMROD radar rainfall. In the first 31 hr, the hourly means, as indicated by the red segment in each of the boxes, of the forecasted rainfall are generally higher than those of the radar rainfall. The forecasted rainfall is almost 0 in the last 5 hr, while the radar observations still show significant rainfall. In general, the UKV forecasted rainfall is higher than the radar rainfall for both the mean and the median values in the entire catchment, which may overpredict the following flood hazard. NIMROD radar rainfall (a), UKV forecasted rainfall (b) from 21:00 on 4 December to 9:00 on 6 December 2015, and their difference (c). The Eden Catchment is outlined by the red curves. Box plots of the hourly rainfall rates of all cells within the Eden Catchment from 21:00 on 4 December to 9:00 on 6 December 2015: (a) radar, (b) forecasted, and (c) their difference. Rainfall observations from the surface weather stations are also used to evaluate the quality of the grid-based rainfall forecasting data. Figure 5 compares the UKV predictions and NIMROD radar rainfall with the gauged observations in the five rainfall stations as indicated in Figure 2. It should be noted that the records from the WARCOP RANGE station have missing data in the middle of the event. Except for the SPADEADAM NO 2 station in the northeast of the catchment, the gauged rainfall rates are generally lower than the forecasted rates but higher than the radar records, which is consistent with the previous conclusions. Nonetheless, the numerical rainfall predictions from the UKV model are still considered to agree reasonably well with the radar rainfall and the gauged records in terms of spatial distribution, intensity, and also temporal pattern. Times series of the UKV forecasted, NIMROD radar, and observed rainfall in the five weather stations. Unlike the hydrological models that must rely on many empirical parameters for flood prediction, HiPIMS, as a hydrodynamic model, contains only the infiltration rate and Manning coefficient as the two essential parameters to be determined. The water level recorded at river gauges during the Storm Desmond flood event between 21:00 on 4 December and 12:00 on 7 December 2015 is used to calibrate and validate HiPIMS for flood modeling and forecasting in the Eden Catchment. As introduced in section 2.2, HiPIMS uses the Green-Ampt model to estimate the infiltration rate. However, due to substantial antecedent rainfall, the catchment was already wet and saturated when the major flood event started (Environment Agency, 2016), suggesting that the infiltration is relatively small and may be neglected during the intense rainfall-induced flood event. To avoid extra model calibration and reduce the requirement of data related to soil conditions, the infiltration rate is set to 0 for the simulations considered in this work. The NIMROD rainfall radar data are used to drive HiPIMS on a 10-m uniform grid for model calibration and validation. Initial conditions of water depth and velocity inside the computational domain are also needed to set up HiPIMS; these were obtained by prerunning HiPIMS on a dry domain using 3 days of antecedent radar rainfall data. Land cover in the Eden Catchment is dominated by grassland, and so only two values of the Manning coefficient are used in the simulations, one for rivers/channels and another for other areas. In HiPIMS, the Manning coefficient adopts values as suggested in the standard hydraulics textbooks (e.g., Chow, 1959). To calibrate the model, different values of the Manning coefficient ranging from 0.035 to 0.095 with a 0.02 interval are used to reproduce the flood event, and the combination of 0.055 for rivers/channels and 0.075 for the rest of the domain is found to provide the “best fit” prediction. in which N is the total number of time steps involved in the simulation, is the observed water level at time step , is the corresponding predicted value, and is the mean observed value. NSE = 1 represents a perfect match between observations and predictions while NSE = 0 indicates that the model predictions are as accurate as the average of the observed data. Obviously, better agreement between the predictions and observations, that is, higher simulation accuracy, is achieved when the value of NSE is closer to 1. To evaluate the model performance, water levels measured at a number of gauges are compared with the simulation results. The Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) coefficient is adopted to quantify the degree of agreement between simulated and observed water levels, which is defined asin whichis the total number of time steps involved in the simulation,is the observed water level at time stepis the corresponding predicted value, andis the mean observed value.= 1 represents a perfect match between observations and predictions while= 0 indicates that the model predictions are as accurate as the average of the observed data. Obviously, better agreement between the predictions and observations, that is, higher simulation accuracy, is achieved when the value ofis closer to 1. Additionally, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the predicted and measured water levels is also calculated to further quantify the simulation error at each of the river gauges: A lower RMSE indicates higher simulation accuracy, and a value of 0 means a perfect fit to the data. In addition to comparing with the in-stream stage measurements, it is also important to know how well the inundation extent is captured by the flood forecasting system. Metrics have been developed and used to quantify the performance of inundation models in predicting flood extents (Bates & De Roo, 2000; Horritt, 2006; Khan et al., 2011; Schubert & Sanders, 2012). A contingency table (Table 1) is used in this work, showing the frequency of “yes” and “no” inundated cells being correctly/mistakenly predicted inside a specified region. In the table, “hit” refers to a flooded cell (as observed) being correctly predicted/forecasted; “miss” implies a flooded cell predicted/forecasted to be not flooded; “false alarm” occurs when a cell that is not hit by flood in reality (i.e., observation) is predicted/forecasted to be flooded; and finally, “correct negative” refers to an unflooded cell (as observed) being correctly predicted/forecasted. As a whole, “hits” and “correct negatives” represent correct predictions, while “misses” and “false alarms” give the wrong predictions. Herein, a computational cell is regarded as a flooded cell if the maximum water depth is predicted to be over 0.3 m, which is the threshold of water depth suggested by the EA as likely to cause property flooding (Environment Agency, 2009). ) can be calculated to further assess the performance of forecast, including Based on the contingency table, subsequent quantitative scores (Saleh et al.,) can be calculated to further assess the performance of forecast, including POD is defined as the ratio between correctly predicted/forecasted flood cells and all of the “observed yes” cells, which is also called “hit rate.” POD ranges from 0 to 1, with POD = 1 returning the perfect forecast. is defined as the ratio between correctly predicted/forecasted flood cells and all of the “observed yes” cells, which is also called “hit rate.”ranges from 0 to 1, with= 1 returning the perfect forecast. FAR calculates the ratio between the “false alarms” and all of the “forecast yes” cells, which also ranges from 0 to 1, with the perfect score being 0. calculates the ratio between the “false alarms” and all of the “forecast yes” cells, which also ranges from 0 to 1, with the perfect score being 0. CSI returns the ratio between the “hits” cells (i.e., cells being correctly forecasted to be flooded) and the total number of flooded cells, either predicted or observed. CSI varies between 0 and 1, with 1 being the perfect score. Figure 6 shows the simulated water levels driven by the NIMROD rainfall inputs, comparing with the observation records at the 16 river gauges. Although clear discrepancy can be detected at some of the gauges, the simulation results are generally consistent with the observations and the rising and falling limbs of the flood hydrograph are correctly predicted at all gauges. The NSE and RMSE are calculated and also shown in the figure to indicate the accuracy of the modeling results. For the four gauges at the downstream part of the River Eden (Linstock, Sheepmount, Great Corby, and Sands Centre), the returned values of NSE range between 0.85 and 0.95, indicating excellent agreement between the simulated and measured water levels. The NSEs calculated for the gauges in the upper Eden River (i.e., Kirkby Stephen, Great Musgrave Bridge, and Temple Sowerby) vary between 0.78 and 0.83, suggesting slightly less impressive but still satisfactory results. However, the NSEs calculated at the gauges on the tributaries (Caldew, Irthing, and Petteril) are diverse, with high values (NSE ≥ 0.8) obtained for Cummersdale on the River Caldew, and Botcherby and Newbiggin on the River Petteril, but low values at Sebergham on the Caldew and Melbourne Park on the Petteril. This indicates that the performance of HiPIMS reproducing water levels for the secondary rivers or tributaries is less satisfactory. The results are as expected since the spatial resolution of the DEM is still not high enough to resolve some of these secondary river courses with an adequate number of computational cells across their widths. The calculated RMSEs demonstrate similar trends. The RMSEs calculated for the River Eden gauges are mostly <0.5 m. However, the RMSEs in the tributary gauges are again more diverse and range between 0.15 and 0.91 m. In general, the water level hydrographs measured at the river gauges during Storm Desmond are satisfactorily reproduced by HiPIMS through a simulation at 10-m spatial resolution. The simulation results are found to be more accurate in the main river (the Eden) and the lower catchment than in the tributaries and the upper catchment. It should be noted that the largest human settlement, Carlisle, is located in the lower catchment and the water levels at gauges across the city including Sheepmount, Sands Centre, Botcherby Bridge, and Skew Bridge are all reproduced to a high level of accuracy, comparing with the observations. This is important for reliable prediction/forecasting of the resulting flood hazard. Simulated (driven by NIMROD rainfall radar data) and observed water level (m) at the 16 river gauges (their locations are shown in Figure 2 ). To further assess and verify the simulation results across the spatial domain, a comparison between the simulated and surveyed flood extents is made in Figure 7 for the most impacted areas in Carlisle. The surveyed flood map provided by the EA covers the two most seriously flooded zones in the city center: (1) the area between Skew Bridge and Sheepmount and (2) the area in either sides of Botcherby Bridge and Melbourne Park (Environment Agency, 2016). It can be observed that the surveyed flood extent is correctly reproduced by the current model to a large extent. It should be noted that the postevent flood map survey relies on photographs and videos with location and time information and other evidences provided by residents and investigators. This essentially means those areas that are not covered by the surveyed flood map cannot be interpreted as never been flooded during the event. So the surveyed flood map should be used with great care. Due to the population distribution, it is reasonable to assume that the surveyed flood extent is more complete in the populated urban area than the rural area. Therefore, the quantitative comparison between the simulated and surveyed flood extents is only made in the urban area of Carlisle, which is more completely covered by the postevent survey. In the U.K. postcode system, the first part of a postcode has one or two letters indicating a city or a region (i.e., city/region code), followed by one or two numbers; and the city center often has the number “1” alongside the city/region code. Based on this, areas with a postcode starting with “CA1” are selected to represent the city center of Carlisle (see Figure 7) and used as an example to compare the simulated and surveyed flood extents. The CA1 city center area is covered by 105,583 grid cells (10 m × 10 m) in the hydrodynamic model, in which 28,274 cells are predicted to be flooded; that is, the maximum water depths in these cells are over 0.3 m during the event. The performance matrices as introduced earlier, that is, POD, FAR, and CSI scores, are calculated by comparing the simulation result with the surveyed flood extent and counting the cells to quantify hits, misses, false alarms, and correct negatives. As shown in Table 2, both POD and CSI return relatively high scores while FAR is relatively low. As a whole, the results confirm that HiPIMS is capable of predicting extreme flooding from intense rainfall without the necessity of intensive model calibration and that reliable simulation results may be obtained by using standard values as suggested in a hydraulics textbook for the model parameters (e.g., Manning coefficient). Performance of the Radar Rainfall-Driven HiPIMS in Reproducing the Surveyed Flood Extent in the Area With Postcodes “CA1” The UKV model releases 36-hr rainfall forecasts every 6 hr at 3:00, 9:00, 15:00, and 21:00 each day, covering the entire period when Storm Desmond occurred. To test the proposed flood forecasting system, the UKV rainfall forecast issued at 21:00 on 4 December 2015 is used, which covers most of the period when intense rainfall occurred. The 36-hr rainfall forecast, that is, grid-based rainfall rate, is used to drive HiPIMS to predict the following fluvial flooding process across the whole Eden Catchment. According to the surveyed flood extent provided by the EA, Carlisle and its upstream region along River Eden are mostly flooded during Storm Desmond (see Figure 7). Apparently, the severity of the flood inundation is closely related to the water level in the nearby river reaches. Therefore, the water level measurements available at the three river gauges located upstream (Great Corby), midstream (Linstock), and downstream (Sheepmount) of the flooded region are selected to evaluate the performance of the flood forecasting system. The observed and forecasted water levels at these three river gauges are compared in Figure 8, together with the calculated NSEs. Generally, the temporal change of the water level is captured reasonably well in all of the three gauges although small overshoot appears in all of the forecasted results. The NSEs are respectively 0.82, 0.72, and 0.76 at Great Corby, Linstock, and Sheepmount, confirming accurate forecasting of the water levels. Observed and forecasted water levels at Great Corby, Linstock, and Sheepmount gauges. Correct prediction of inundation extent is crucial to assess flood risk and plan mitigation strategies. Figure 9 illustrates the forecasted inundation maps for Carlisle and the surrounding areas at different output times to depict the flooding process during Storm Desmond. At 6:00 on 5 December 2015, the southwest corner of Carlisle has been flooded, most likely influenced by the River Caldew (Figure 9a). At 12:00, a large part of the city along the River Eden has been inundated although the water depth is still relatively small (Figure 9b). Then 12 hr later at 00:00 on 6 December, the maximum inundation extent has almost been reached, and almost the entire surveyed flood extent has been covered (Figure 9c). This is consistent with the water level hydrographs as presented in Figure 8, in which the water levels at the three gauges all reach their peak values at this moment. Figure 9d shows the final maximum inundation extent obtained throughout the simulation. Quantitative assessment of the flood extent modeling results in the Carlisle city center is given in Table 3, showing a high hit rate and reasonably low false alarm rate. Forecasted flood inundation maps in Carlisle and the surrounding areas at different output times. Performance of the UKV Forecast Rainfall-Driven HiPIMS in Reproducing the Surveyed Flood Extent in Carlisle With Postcodes “CA1” As the difference between the NIMROD radar rainfall and the UKV forecasted rainfall is noticeable (refer to the discussion in section 4.2), it is necessary to compare the flood modeling results driven by different rainfall sources and confirm the reliability of the flood forecasting outputs. The maximum inundation map obtained with the UKV forecast rainfall (as shown in Figure 9d) agrees well with that produced using radar rainfall (Figure 7). Both of the predicted maximum inundation maps are consistent with the EA surveyed flood extent although the forecast appears to predict inundation in a few places that were not flooded according to the EA surveyed map. This is confirmed by the higher hit rate and false alarm rate of the forecast (POD = 0.99, FAR = 0.28, see Table 3) than those calculated against the simulation results driven by radar rainfall (POD = 0.91, FAR = 0.21, see Table 2), which means the forecast may slightly overestimate the actual Storm Desmond flood in Carlisle. In order to further compare the simulation results obtained using different rainfall inputs, a 63-hr gridded rainfall data set starting from 21:00 on 4 December 2015 is generated to cover the entire duration of the flood event, which consists of the 36-hr rainfall forecast released at 21:00 on 4 December and the first 27-hr of the rainfall rates released 36 hr later at 9:00 on 6 December. Figure 10 presents the water level hydrographs predicted using the different 63-hr rainfall inputs, compared with the corresponding observations at the three selected river gauges. The water levels predicted using the UVK rainfall are found to overpredict the actual water level as observed. However, the water levels resulting from the radar rainfall-driven simulation are generally smaller than both of the forecasted and measured values. The results are to a large extent as expected and consistent with the positive error of the UKV rainfall predictions, as discussed in section 4.1. Table 4 presents the NSEs calculated for the different water levels at the three selected gauges (Great Corby, Linstock, and Sheepmount). The NSEs from the UKV rainfall-driven simulation are consistently smaller than those calculated against the predictions using radar rainfall. This is consistent with the previous analysis and again confirms that the prediction error of the UKV rainfall data leads to less accurate flood simulation results. Overall, all of the NSEs are still calculated to be consistently bigger than 0.7, which are considered to be acceptable. Comparing water level hydrographs obtained using different rainfall inputs with the measurements at the three selected gauges. NSEs Calculated for the Water Levels Predicted Using the UKV Forecast and NIMROD Radar Rainfall Inputs Considering the computational efficiency, the proposed flood forecasting system only takes 1 hr and 45 min to produce the 36-hr forecast on a 10-m uniform grid covering the 2,500-km2 simulation domain (leading to 25 million computational cells) on 8 × NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPUs. This effectively means that, with the NWPs released 36 hr in advance, the current forecasting system can produce a flood forecast within 2 hr, giving more than 34 hr of lead time. According to the Carlisle Flood Investigation Report (Environment Agency, 2016), the earliest flood warning for this event was issued at 13:11 on 5 December 2015, and then a severe flood warning was issued at 17:34 on the same day. Using the flood forecasting system proposed in this work, flood forecasts and subsequent warnings may be available as early as 23:00 on 4 December, almost 1 day before the flood peak arrived at Carlisle. Compared with the traditional flood forecasting systems based on hydrological models where in most cases only the upstream flow hydrographs are predicted, the proposed hydrodynamic flood forecasting system can provide detailed flood information including water depth, flow velocities, and inundation extents at high resolution across the entire catchment. Such detailed flood information is essential for assessing potential flood impact and allows relevant decision-makers to develop better informed flood mitigation strategies and emergency management plans.\n\n5.1 Trade-Off Between the Spatial Resolution and Forecasting Lead Time In hydrodynamic flood simulations, the performance of a model is usually sensitive to spatial resolution. Satisfactory flood forecast is produced by the proposed HiPIMS-based flood forecasting system on a 10-m uniform grid. However, as discussed in section 4.2, the predicted water levels agree more closely with the observations at the gauges in the downstream catchment and the main river course than those in the upstream catchment and tributaries where the river channels are too narrow to be well resolved on a 10-m grid. Furthermore, certain key land surface features, such as walls, dikes, and other flood defenses, may not be well represented by the DEM at the chosen resolution. Therefore, the accuracy of flood forecasts may be further improved if simulations are run at a higher spatial resolution. To test this hypothesis, a 66-km2 subcatchment located at the southeast of the Eden Catchment (see Figure 11a) is selected to conduct further simulations, including a simulation at 5-m resolution. Driven by radar rainfall data, both of the 5- and 10-m simulations use the same model parameters and initial conditions as the aforementioned whole-catchment simulation. The water level hydrographs produced by the 5- and 10-m simulations are compared with the measurements available at the Kirkby Stephen gauge station inside the subcatchment, as shown in Figure 11b. The hydrograph predicted at 5-m resolution observed to agree slightly better with the observations, as confirmed by a higher NSE and a lower RMSE. The two sets of hydrographs are actually similar during the high-flow period but are significantly different at the low-flow sections when the river flow starts to rise at the beginning and fall back to the normal flow condition at the end. The results are to a large extent as expected. River Eden at Kirkby Stephen is around 20 m wide. Comparing with the 10-m DEM, the 5-m DEM can better represent the river geometry and more importantly avoid disconnected courses of small rivers in spatial discretization, leading to better predicted water level hydrographs especially in the low-flow stages when resolving river connectivity becomes more important. (a) Topography map of the selected subcatchment; (b) comparing the observed and simulated water levels at Kirkby Stephen obtained at 5- and 10-m resolutions, respectively. However, a grid of 2 times finer resolution contains 4 times more computational cells, requiring approximately 8 times of runtime for an explicit hydrodynamic model like HiPIMS to finish a simulation when also taking into account the reduced time steps (see Table 5). For flood forecasting, it is crucially important to provide sufficient lead time for flood risk mitigation and emergency management. Although a simulation on a 5-m grid may better resolve the domain topography and river geometry and thus produce better results, 14 hr of runtime is needed to complete the 36-hr simulation as considered in the current study, leading to a loss of 12-hr lead time in providing a flood forecast in comparison with the 10-m simulation. The trade-off between spatial resolution and lead time must be carefully considered and evaluated. For the current case study in the Eden Catchment, simulation at 10-m resolution produces satisfactory results and is considered to be the optimum resolution for timely flood forecasting using the current GPU devices. Furthermore, as the runtime of a 36-hr hydrodynamic simulation is shorter than the release interval of the UKV rainfall forecasts, this leaves a certain level of flexibility for calibrating HiPIMS using real-time observations (data assimilation) when available. Runtimes of HiPIMS for 36-hr Flood Simulations in the Eden Catchment at Different Spatial Resolutions The UKV model is a deterministic model that produces one prediction in each output. Uncertainties from the UKV model may propagate to HiPIMS and affect the flood forecasts. To evaluate the impact of the cascading uncertainties, rainfall predictions added with ±10% and ±20% of artificial errors are used to drive HiPIMS to produce flood forecasts for comparison and further analysis. The water depth hydrographs at Great Corby, Linstock, and Sheepmount predicted from the four modified rainfall scenarios are compared with the results obtained using the original UKV rainfall predictions (Figure 12). The results show that the effect of rainfall errors on the simulated water depth increases from the upstream to downstream gauges. But the overall errors of disturbed hydrographs are relatively small in comparison with the originally predicted water depths. This is further confirmed by the RMSEs given in Table 6, calculated against the originally predicted water depth at the three gauges. In the table, the relative mean error is calculated by dividing the average RMSE by the mean water depth at the gauge under consideration. The results imply that the uncertainties from the rainfall prediction in terms of intensity are not amplified by the hydrodynamic model toward the flood forecasting outputs in this case. Time histories of water depth obtained using the forecasted rainfall modified with different levels of error. The proposed forecasting system is targeted at predicting intense rainfall-induced flood events, which are predominantly caused by rapid increase of river flows as result of excess surface runoff. Transferability of the flood forecasting system depends on the availability of high-resolution topographic and rainfall input data and the parameterization of the hydrodynamic model, that is, to specify the model parameters for friction and infiltration effects. A fully hydrodynamic modeling approach, such as HiPIMS, commonly parameterizes the friction effect using the Manning coefficient, and satisfactory simulation results can be obtained using stand values suggested by a hydraulic textbook for different types of land covers. However, deciding the parameters for infiltration is less straightforward. Infiltration rate is influenced by the spatial heterogeneity of the catchment surface and soil, that is, different land covers/soil types, and also the initial soil moisture. In the current implementation of HiPIMS, the infiltration rate is estimated by the Green-Ampt model and is a function of infiltration depth, soil moisture, hydraulic conductivity, capillary head, and ponding depth. Through choosing appropriate parameters for the Green-Ampt model, HiPIMS may be applied in catchments with different hydrological conditions. The Green-Ampt model is directly applicable in arid or semiarid catchments, which are dominant by infiltration-excess runoff generation, and the values of the relevant parameters can be directly derived according to the spatial distribution of soil properties and soil moisture. However, for a more humid catchment in England that is predominantly featured with saturation-excess runoff generation, an additional step is needed to spatially divide the model domain into two categories, that is, saturated zones and unsaturated zones. For saturated zones, which usually include low-lying valleys, the infiltration rate is small and may be set to 0. For unsaturated zones, which are usually located in hillslopes and highlands, the infiltration rate may be estimated by the Green-Ampt model as normal. As a crucial step, the classification of saturated and unsaturated zones may be based on the groundwater table and soil moisture condition of a catchment. For both arid/semiarid and humid catchments, remote sensing products and outputs from regional scale hydrological models may provide useful data sources and information for estimating infiltration parameters. However, we should also realize that the spatial data for groundwater table, soil properties, and initial soil moisture are often scarce or come with significant uncertainties. Calibration of a model against infiltration parameters based on water depths or stream discharges is therefore unavoidable in many cases. The calibration process may involve the use of certain model optimization strategies as reported in the literature (Evin et al., 2013; Madsen, 2003; Muleta & Nicklow, 2005). In the current case study, infiltration is simply neglected because the majority of the catchment was assumed to be saturated due to substantial antecedent rainfall, and the effect of infiltration on the following flooding was considered to be insignificant (Environment Agency, 2016). However, when dealing with less extreme events or events occurring in an originally drier catchment, the infiltration effect should be taken into account, and more data and extra effort are needed for model calibration. An alternative way to increase the applicability of the current HiPIMS-based flood forecasting system for a wider range of hydrological conditions is to integrate HiPIMS with a hydrological modeling system so that the surface runoff is estimated by the hydrological model and HiPIMS is used to simulate the full-scale overland flow and flooding processes. Finally, it should be noted that, due to the specific limitation of HiPIMS in handling subsurface flows (i.e., no explicit consideration of subsurface runoff), the current flood forecasting system may not be suitable for forecasting long-term flood events that are sensitive to subsurface runoff, such as those induced by prolonged but less intense monsoon rainfall.\n• high-resolution DEMs and spatial data to resolve complex topographic features and river geometry;\n• estimation of the spatial distributions of soil and land cover types, and soil moisture conditions; and\n• field observation data, for example, water level, flow discharge, and flood extent, for model calibration and verification. In summary, the current hydrodynamic model-based flood forecasting system is transferable for application in different catchments to forecast flooding from intense rainfall, provided that the following data sets are available to properly set up the model and drive the simulations: In addition to data availability, the transferability of the forecasting system is also restricted by catchment size and availability of computing resources. In the current case study, the forecasting system can provide flood forecasts at 10-m resolution within 2 hr in a 2,500-km2 computational domain on a computer server fitted with 8 × NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPUs. Application to larger catchments will involve longer simulation times, but it can be reduced by running the model on more advanced high-performance computing facilities. Therefore, the feasibility of the proposed system for real-time applications should be also evaluated by taking into account the availability of computing resources. Flood defenses or hydraulic control facilities such as pumping stations, sluice gates, or embankments may significantly influence the flooding process, especially in the urbanized areas. One limitation of the current flood forecasting system is that the current HiPIMS can only represent the static state of the flood defenses or other hydraulic structures, that is, cannot simulate the dynamic processes of defense failure and flood mitigation strategies taking place during an event. Hence, the next step of development would be to further improve HiPIMS to directly simulate the operation and potential failure of certain key flood control infrastructure systems, which will have a predominant influence on the evolution of a flood event. Ensemble modeling has now been widely used and become a general practice in NWP across the world (e.g., Cloke & Pappenberger, 2009). Ensemble techniques have also been applied in hydrological modeling to deal with the uncertainties associated with model parameters, initial and boundary conditions (Jeong & Kim, 2005; Seo et al., 2006). Potentially, an ensemble forecasting system that produces probabilistic flood predictions could provide more reliable future flood information to the public and decision-makers. However, developing and operating an ensemble forecasting system will clearly require much more computing resources to run the model multiple times with various input data and parameters. In the United Kingdom, a short-range ensemble weather forecasting model called the Regional Ensemble Prediction System (MOGREPS) is operated by the Met Office to produce weather forecasts in real time. Therefore, another direction for future development would be to use the MOGREPS rainfall forecasts and further enhance HiPIMS to deliver an ensemble flood forecasting system."
