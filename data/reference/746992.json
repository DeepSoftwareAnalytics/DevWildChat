For gifs and photos. For the longest time, I‚Äôve wanted photoshop to do fancy edits with transparent backgrounds and being able to overlay gifs on top of each other. For about 6 years, I‚Äôve tried multiple apps and they all couldn‚Äôt even come close to the capabilities of Adobe. \n\n\n\nHowever, I was recommended this app by an editor that I like. Ever since I‚Äôve opened this, it feels like my hobby as a gif/photo editor has changed completely. Any apps made on this app benefits you and doesn‚Äôt seem like just another cash grab for money by people that think you‚Äôre stupid. It has so many capabilities such as stickers, filters, and my favorite‚Äî the ability to change the canvas. It is so, so useful and I honestly recommend that everyone that either doesn‚Äôt have photoshop or a desktop download it. Because it is worth every single five star review given on here and will save you a bunch of time and energy in exchange for fun. Hello! Thank you so much for being an ImgPlay user. üíï We are so happy to see your review. üòä We definitely will keep working hard to develop the app to make it even better. Whenever there are suggestions or questions, feel free to contact us anytime! Great App, Could Use Some Further Options App is fun to use. However, I wish it had a few more options available:\n\n\n\n- MPEG-4 AAC, H.264 Codec for Video - when exporting video, the codec for the MP4 files are HEVC. I can't upload to some websites like Pixieset because they only accept H264 or MPEG4k codec videos. So what I've been doing is exporting video files using this app, then reimporting and exporting using Adobe Express online so that the video could be converted to H264 codec. Kind of a long work around but it works.\n\n\n\n- Sort By Filename option. I wish there was some way to sort file names of the photos to be used as a GIF. Sometimes importing the files into the app makes it out of order and it's hard to discern which one goes first etc. If there was a way to implement that option, that would be awesome.\n\n\n\n- Seconds input & slider. At the moment, when choosing the duration of a gif or video, you can only use a slider but sometimes it's annoying because you move a little and you go over what you're trying by .01 seconds. For example, if i'm exporting a video and I know that I want it to be .09 speed, the only way I can do that is with the slider and sometimes I'll miss the mark and make it .10 or .11. I wish there was a way to just type in the duration with my keyboard in addition to also having the slider available. Hopefully in an update they can do both.\n\n\n\nOther than those few quirks, this is a very powerful tool and I'm glad that I purchased the full version. I use this app weekly to produce animations from my phone using the photos from my photo stream. They‚Äôve improved it in many ways over the years, including the ability to reorder frames which is huge! I love being able to go back and forth to select which photos I do and don‚Äôt want to use frame by frame.\n\n\n\nThe one feature I would most love for them to improve is the ability to place additional photo frames after you start building your timeline anywhere you want. They did add the ability to add frames at the end of a sequence, which is huge! But unlike all of the other frames, you can‚Äôt drag to reorder them, you can only place them at the end. This makes this feature pretty useless for my purposes, but it‚Äôs almost a great feature. Overall, thanks for your work on this app! Hello, thank you for your sweet words. We really appreciate it. We definitely will keep working hard to develop the app to make it even better ;) \n\n\n\nWhen you add photo/video, you can reorder them by long press! On the Frame View screen, you will be able to see the photos/videos on the top.(Above the frames) Long press the photos/videos that you would like to reorder, then you will be able to move them, don't need to move the frame by frame. ;) Please kindly try this out and let us know at imgplay.ios@imgbase.me if you experience any difficulty. \n\n\n\nI hope this helps.

        "document": "The noble GIF animated image format is over 30 years old, and despite reports that the youth think they've outlived their coolness, they remain popular with a certain vintage of internet user (like this aging writer). GIFs can be used in chats on phones, apps and business platforms like Slack to express yourself with a very specific reference and vibe.\n\nLet's get this out of the way: There's some debate over how the acronym GIF (spelled G-I-F and stands for graphic Interchange format) is said aloud. The creators of the GIF pronounce it JIF like Jif peanut butter, but the vast majority of people say GIF with a hard G. Technically both are accepted, but the latter camp is numerous, vocal and hostile in its position -- stay strong, fellow JIFers.\n\nRead more: Best Phone to Buy for 2024\n\nWhichever way you pronounce it, there is something technical to keep in mind: GIF has become a byword for embeddable files that play a short animation on loop, but they aren't always in the GIF format. Over the years, more animators are releasing them in other image formats, like PNG, or even in short HTML5 video formats like MP4. When you make a GIF-style animation, you'll probably be given the option to use these different formats. Keep in mind that the video formats are often smaller in size as they use compression to take up less space, and are potentially sharper to boot. It shouldn't matter which you use since most platforms support multiple media formats, but it's good to check.\n\nFinding GIFs to post is straightforward, but making your own is a bit complicated. There are dozens of ways you can make a GIF on your phone or computer without using dedicated software like Photoshop. Some of them are downloadable, while others simply work in your browser. Here are a few of the easiest ways to do so.\n\nPlenty of sites specialize in turning a video or set of photos into a GIF, but the go-to for years has been Ezgif. It's straightforward, continues to be updated and it also works on either a phone or a computer. To turn a video file into a GIF start by going to ezgif.com.\n\nAcross the top of the site are some tools that let you do create a GIF or modify an existing one. Click on the Video To GIF button and then click the Choose File button to select the video you want, or drop a URL into the file (but video sites like YouTube won't work). Next, click the blue Upload video button. You can monitor the progress of your upload in the bottom of your browser window. Once it's done, you'll see a playback window with your video in it.\n\nNow you can adjust the length, the resolution and frame rate. All of these will affect the file size of your GIF. If you don't want to make any adjustments, click the blue Convert to GIF button under the video player window and enjoy the patient kitty cat animation while your video is transformed into a GIF. You can also save it to a different format (AVIF, JPG sequence, MP4, or others) by clicking the convert dropdown menu below the video. If you're happy with your GIF, hit Save. And you're done. Seriously, it's that easy.\n\nIf you want to take your GIF to the next level, you can scroll back up to the playback window and edit the duration. Look for a short and sweet moment between 2 to 4 seconds. As you play your video, you can select start and end times with the blue Use current position buttons under the video player. As for file size, aim for a GIF that is between 5 and 7 megabytes.\n\nNext, you can customize your GIF: Crop it, resize it, rotate it, reverse it and add effects. I like this because you can change the color and the background as well as add filters, overlays and text. Again, once you're happy with the results hit Save and you now have a GIF.\n\nWe like Ezgif a lot, but depending on your phone there are a few other ways to make a GIF.\n\nThere are dozens of apps for turning a video into a GIF in Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store. Giphy is easy to use, is free, has enough playful editing options and doesn't take long to use. You can create a GIF and post it publicly for others to use and share (if you're into that).\n\nTo start, open the app and tap on the plus sign on the bottom. You can record a video from scratch or use an existing one from your phone.\n\nNext, you'll see a live preview of your GIF, which you can trim and add text, effects or stickers to. When you're done, tap the purple arrow. Once the GIF is created, you can upload it to Giphy for anyone to use or tap Share GIF to save it to your phone or send to a friend.\n\nIf you have a modern Samsung Galaxy phone, you can make a GIF using the Edge Panel. Basically there's a tool on the Edge panel that can make a GIF from whatever is on the screen.\n\nTo do so, go to Settings to turn the Edge Panel on. There are a bunch of panel themes to choose from. Select the one named Smart Select.\n\nTo capture a GIF of what's onscreen, open the Edge Panel by slowly sliding your finger from the right edge to the left. The first time I tried opening the Edge Panel it took a couple of tries. Once it's open, tap on the GIF icon. A GIF capture window will appear as an overlay. Whatever is inside the window will become your GIF. You can resize and move the capture window and when you're ready tap the record button.\n\nWe should note that while the screen is being recorded, you're locked out of navigating your phone. When you've got what you want, hit stop. You can share your GIF right away or save it to your Gallery.\n\niPhone Live Photos aren't GIFs, but Shortcuts can make one\n\nThe iPhone has native ways to record a GIF, but they're wonky. You'll need to run your request through its productivity-minded Shortcuts app.\n\nTo start, download and open Shortcuts. On the bottom right, tap the Gallery button. The gallery has thousands of prebuilt shortcuts you can install to do different things on your phone. You can search for the term \"Video to GIF\" or just scroll down to the GIF shortcut section.\n\nThe specific shortcut you're looking for is Video to GIF. It has a blue rectangle icon. Simply tap to install it. You can access this Shortcut (and really any Shortcuts you've installed) via the Share menu or in the Shortcuts app under the Library tab.\n\nTo make a GIF, tap on open the Shortcuts app and navigate to the Shortcuts tab on the bottom. Select Video to Gif. You'll be presented with videos from your camera roll that you can turn into a gif. Choose a video (though it calls it an image). Next, you can trim the video, though sadly there's no ability to add stickers or text. When you're ready, hit Save.\n\nNow the GIF will be on your screen, but it's not actually saved. Hit the Share button to save your brand new GIF to the Photos app, or send it straight away to a friend.\n\nIf you want to follow step by step as I create GIFs, check out this video from CNET's How To Do It All YouTube channel."

        "document": "Giphy Cam for iOS was first released in August 2015 and has been tied to several well-known advertising campaigns including the release of the new X-Files series, and the opening of Star Wars Episode VII ‚Äî The Force Awakens. The app allows you to capture picture bursts that are converted in animated GIFs, but also allows you to modify any image, video, or existing GIF (!) on your camera roll.\n\nAs you might have guessed, my favorite feature of the app is its ability to modify existing animated GIFs. The Camera Roll on any iOS device does not, as of this writing, play back animated GIFs, so seeing your Camera Roll as it should appear is welcome breath of fresh air.\n\nBut more compelling than the mere support of animated GIFs, is the way that Giphy (with obvious self-interest) treats animated GIFs ‚Äî as an equal to video.\n\nIn fact, on more than one occasion I have created GIFs in other apps only to edit them, or convert them to video (for Instagram posting, etc‚Ä¶) using Giphy Cam. It has become for me a very, very useful app.\n\nNot only do GIFs play back the same way videos do, but the prominent pixelated dog-ear from Giphy‚Äôs logo, along with the familiar four-sprocket perforations signifying video, are effectively used to distinguish between the two formats.\n\nThe use of the logo is not only a good graphic indication for users of different file formats, but it also deftly reinforces Giphy‚Äôs quest to dominate the format. Hard ‚ÄúG,‚Äù indeed."

        "document": "Giphy, arguably the biggest GIF website online, has created a new app called Giphy Cam. The iOS app, released Thursday, lets you create moving images of anything you like -- right on your iPhone. It literally takes seconds to create a GIF, save it and share it with your friends. Look at how fun this is!\n\nYou use your iPhone's camera with the app's filters to create some personalized, animated fun. There are five different types of GIFs you can make with Giphy Cam. You can just use a filter to film yourself in black and white or other Instagram-like filters like \"Film\" or \"Faded.\" There are also some sillier filters like \"Pixel\" and \"VHS,\" seen below:\n\nWith any of the GIFs you create, you can choose to make them in burst mode, where the app takes a few photos of you in quick succession (seen above), or record mode, where the app records a smooth video of you (seen below).\n\nThe next option you have is \"Reactions,\" which include overlaid images and animations that showcase a certain emotion, like happiness, love, gratitude, anger and more. Here's an especially sad reaction GIF we made:\n\nThe next option is the \"Magic Wand,\" which puts an animated backdrop behind you. Some options include water, fireworks, hearts, trippy designs and glitter (seen below). All you need is a solid wall behind you for this one to work. It's shockingly easy.\n\nNext are \"Overlays,\" which pop a fun little animation over your image. You can have cat ears, sunglasses, a crown a funny little animated friend sitting next to you and more. Check out this wiggly mustache:\n\n\"Giphy has been working closely with the good folks at The Huffington Post for a while; and, Arianna Huffington says that sleep is the key to success,\" Giphy's COO Adam Leibsohn says. \"Well, 'sleep' and 'tired' are popular searches on Giphy; so, we saw this as a great opportunity to collaborate on the 'Zzzzzz' filter in Giphy Cam.\"\n\nYou can use either your front-facing or normal camera, and whatever filter you're using shows on the screen as you create the GIF, so you'll have an idea of what it will look like.\n\nOnce you make the GIF you have the option to save it to your phone, text it to someone, tweet it, send it in a Facebook message, post it to Instagram and more. You also have the option to redo the GIF."
