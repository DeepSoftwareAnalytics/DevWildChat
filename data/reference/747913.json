        "document": "AI chatbots like ChatGPT have taken the world by storm because they can generate nearly any kind of text -- including essays, reports, and code -- in seconds. AI image generators, however, are even more fun because they can take a simple prompt and generate a visual representation of whatever you're imagining.\n\nUse cases for text-to-image AI generators can range from personal projects, such as creating greeting cards, event invites, and wallpapers, to professional projects, such as developing brand assets, social media content, or marketing campaigns. The possibilities are endless.\n\nOpenAI's DALL-E 2 made a huge splash as the first mainstream AI image generator. Other companies have released models that surpass DALL-E 2, and OpenAI has since released a more advanced model, DALL-E 3, which replaced its predecessor.\n\nAlso: The best AI chatbots: ChatGPT, Copilot and worthy alternatives\n\nI've been testing AI image generators since 2022. For my most recent round of testing, I gave each image generator tool the same prompt: \"A vibrant, realistic hummingbird perched on a tree.\" I also included screenshots to help you decide which tool best matches your needs.\n\nI ranked all the image generators from best to lowest image quality. Since the actual image output is only one factor in choosing an image generator, I also included details on cost, speed, accessibility, and other standouts from my testing.\n\nFor image generators whose strong suit is something other than generating high-quality images, such as generating accurate text, I included those results instead as they help you visualize how good it is at that specific task.\n\nWhat is the best AI image generator overall?\n\nIn my most recent test, Google's ImageFX dethroned Microsoft Designer's Image Generator as the best overall AI image generator because it generates the highest-quality, most realistic renditions for free. Google has been a dark horse in the AI space, so the company beating more well-established contenders surprised me.\n\nImageFX combines accuracy, speed, and cost-effectiveness and can generate images in seconds. A major plus is that the generator is easy to use for beginners and has unique features like expressive chips.\n\nAlso: Microsoft launches free mobile app versions of Designer, its AI photo creator\n\nChatGPT is a solid alternative, especially since OpenAI in August made image generation on ChatGPT available to all free users. ChatGPT is not in first place because you're limited to two photos per day with its image generation tool, which is not a lot compared to most other generators, and because ImageFX produces higher-quality images.\n\nWhether you want to generate images of animals, objects, or even abstract concepts, ImageFX can produce accurate depictions that will meet your expectations. It is highly efficient, user-friendly, and cost-effective.\n\nFor the full roundup of the best AI image generators, keep reading.\n\nThe best AI art generators of 2024\n\nWhat is the best free image generator?\n\nGoogle's ImageFX is the best AI image generator because it produces the highest-quality, most realistic image for free. The photo quality even exceeds that of OpenAI's latest model, DALL-E 3. When accessing DALL-E 3 from OpenAI's services, you need to pay for unlimited access. Otherwise, you're limited to two generations per day.\n\nHow do you fix a poorly generated image?\n\nYou can fix a poorly generated image by readjusting your prompt to fix the element of the image you are having trouble with. For example, if you say, \"Generate an image of the beach,\" and are disappointed at the way the ocean looks, you can input another prompt that says, \"Generate an image of a beach with crystal blue, shallow water.\" The more specific you get, the better your result will be.\n\nAre there ethical implications with AI image generators?\n\nAI image generators are trained on billions of images from across the internet. These images are often artworks belonging to specific artists, which an AI tool repurposes to generate your image. Although the output is different, the new image has elements of the artist's original work that are not credited to them.\n\nWhether an AI-generated image is copyrighted depends on the terms of the generator you are using. The copyright policies also vary between subscription tiers. The best way to proceed is not to assume and to double-check before you use or publish a generated image.\n\nHow do I properly disclose that my images were AI-generated?\n\nA good habit when using AI to generate images is to disclose that AI was involved in the process. Doing so helps build trust with your audience, as well as helps prevent misinformation from spreading. A disclosure can be as simple as something that reads, \"Generated by [the name of the generator].\"\n\nYou will notice that at ZDNET, we always disclose when we use an AI image generator image in an article, using a disclosure such as, \"Sabrina Ortiz/ZDNET via [Image generator name].\"\n\nAre there DALL-E 3 alternatives worth considering?\n\nMany AI image generators produce better results than OpenAI's tool. If you want to try something different, check out one of our alternatives above or the two additional options below."

        "document": "AI image generation refers to the process of creating visual content using artificial intelligence technologies. These technologies enable the creation of images from textual descriptions or other forms of input. Image generators use generative AI models to produce original, realistic visuals that can be used across industries from entertainment to healthcare.\n\nAI image generation involves training neural networks on large datasets of images. Through this training, the AI learns the characteristics and attributes of the images, enabling it to generate new visuals that are stylistically and contextually similar to those in the training data.\n• Popular Applications and Use Cases of AI Image Generation\n• Best Practices for Using AI Image Generation Tools\n\nAI image generators are tools that use artificial intelligence to create visual content from textual or other forms of input. Typically, these generators offer a user-friendly interface where users input text or select parameters, and the AI processes this information to create an image.\n• DALL-E by OpenAI: Known for its ability to generate highly detailed and creative images from textual descriptions, DALL-E can produce a wide variety of visuals, from realistic landscapes to imaginative scenes.\n• MidJourney: This tool excels in generating artistic and stylized images, often used by designers and artists to explore new creative directions.\n• Stable Diffusion: An open-source AI image generator that emphasizes flexibility and customization, allowing users to fine-tune various parameters to achieve the desired output.\n• RunwayML: Provides a range of AI tools for image generation, including models that can transform and enhance existing photos or create entirely new images from scratch.\n\nPopular Applications and Use Cases of AI Image Generation {#popular-applications-and-use-cases-of-ai-image-generation}\n\nAI image generation streamlines the content creation process by allowing creators to produce a wide array of visuals efficiently. This technology is particularly beneficial for creating digital art, social media graphics, and visual storytelling.\n\nContent creators can generate custom images that align with their themes or narratives, enabling them to maintain a consistent aesthetic across their platforms without extensive manual design work. Additionally, AI-generated images can be used to supplement written content, enhancing engagement and visual appeal.\n\nIn film and animation, AI-generated visuals help in creating realistic characters, scenes, and special effects that would be time-consuming and costly to produce traditionally. Video game developers use AI to design detailed environments, characters, and assets, enhancing the immersive experience for players.\n\nMarketers can quickly generate product images, promotional graphics, and advertisements tailored to specific demographics and preferences. This technology allows for rapid A/B testing and optimization, ensuring that the most effective visuals are used in campaigns. It also makes it possible to personalize advertising and promotions to specific segments.\n\nAI image generation is transforming the field of medical imaging by improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. AI models can generate high-resolution images from low-quality scans, assist in reconstructing 3D models from 2D images, and enhance images to highlight critical areas for diagnosis.\n\nAI image generation uses advanced machine learning techniques to create visual content based on textual descriptions or other inputs. This process involves several key technologies:\n\nThe initial step in AI image generation involves interpreting and understanding text prompts through Natural Language Processing (NLP). For image generation, NLP models convert textual descriptions into numerical representations that the AI can process.\n\nOne prominent NLP model used in this context is the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, developed by OpenAI. It encodes text into high-dimensional vectors, which capture the semantic meaning and context of the text, breaking down complex descriptions into comprehensible elements.\n\nFor example, given a prompt like \"a red apple on a tree,\" the NLP model identifies key components such as \"red,\" \"apple,\" and \"tree,\" and understands their relationships. This encoded information acts as a blueprint for the image generation process, ensuring that the AI accurately represents the described scene.\n\nIntroduced by Ian Goodfellow and colleagues in 2014, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) consist of two competing neural networks: the generator and the discriminator. This adversarial setup drives both networks to improve continuously, resulting in highly realistic image generation.\n\nThe generator’s role is to create fake images from random noise. It starts with a vector of random values and uses these to produce an image. The discriminator evaluates images and determines whether they are real (from the training dataset) or fake (produced by the generator). The generator aims to produce images that can fool the discriminator.\n\nTraining GANs involves a feedback loop where both networks learn from each other. When the discriminator correctly identifies an image as fake, the generator receives feedback and adjusts its parameters to produce more realistic images. If the generator successfully deceives the discriminator, the discriminator updates its criteria to become more discerning.\n\nGANs can generate high-resolution images with fine details. However, they are limited in their ability to create diverse images based on natural language instructions, and are being replaced by diffusion models for many image generation use cases.\n\nDiffusion models generate new data, such as images, by simulating the diffusion process in physics. They start with random noise and iteratively transform it into a coherent image, guided by learned patterns from the training data.\n\nThe process begins with forward diffusion, where the model adds Gaussian noise to an image over a series of steps. This gradual addition of noise transforms the original image into pure noise. The model then learns to reverse this process, progressively removing noise to recover the original image. This reverse diffusion enables the model’s generative capability.\n\nTraining diffusion models involves teaching the model to predict the noise added at each step and to reverse it accurately. The model learns to estimate the difference between the noisy image and the original image at each stage.\n\nOnce trained, diffusion models can generate new images by starting with random noise and applying the reverse diffusion process. A text prompt guides this process, directing the model on what the final image should look like.\n\nThere are several challenges associated with generating images using AI, which creators and organizations must consider.\n• Ethical concerns: Generated images have the potential for misuse. Deepfakes, which are highly realistic but fabricated images or videos, can be used to spread misinformation, manipulate public opinion, or defame individuals. For example, deepfake technology has been used to create fake news videos and unauthorized celebrity videos.\n• Bias and representation: AI models learn from the data they are trained on, which can include biases present in the dataset. If the training data predominantly features certain demographics, the AI might produce images that reinforce stereotypes or exclude certain groups. For example, if an AI is trained mostly on images of one ethnicity or gender, it may struggle to accurately generate images of people from other groups.\n• Displacement of creativity: As AI tools become more sophisticated, they might reduce the demand for human artists and designers, potentially leading to a loss of unique, human-driven creativity. The automation of creative tasks can lead to a homogenization of content, where AI-generated visuals might lack the personal touch and originality that human creators bring.\n\nBest Practices for Using AI Image Generation Tools {#best-practices-for-using-ai-image-generation-tools}\n\nWhen using AI image generators, it’s important to consider the following best practices to achieve the best outputs.\n\nBefore using an AI image generator, it’s essential to have a clear and comprehensive vision of the image you want to create. Start by conceptualizing the overall scene, including key elements such as objects, people, and background settings. Think about the mood and atmosphere you want to convey, as well as specific details such as colors, lighting, textures, and composition.\n\nFor example, if you’re creating an image of a bustling city street, visualize the types of buildings, the presence of people, vehicles, and even the time of day. A well-defined idea helps in crafting precise prompts, ensuring that the AI generates images that closely match your vision.\n\nPrompt engineering is the process of designing and refining the text inputs (prompts) used to guide the AI image generation. Effective prompts are clear, descriptive, and specific. Start by understanding the basic structure of a prompt and the importance of including key details. For example, instead of a vague prompt like “a tree,” use a detailed description such as “a tall oak tree with autumn leaves and a wooden bench underneath.”\n\nExperiment with different phrasings and observe how they influence the generated images. Practice including elements like adjectives, spatial relationships, and context to enrich the prompt. A great way to get started with prompts for image generation tools is to use a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT or Google Gemini, and ask it to create a prompt for an image in the tool of your choice.\n\nAI image generators can produce different results for the same prompt due to their inherent variability. To maximize the chances of obtaining a high-quality image, run the same prompt multiple times and compare the results. Each iteration might bring subtle or significant variations, providing a broader range of options to choose from. Some image generation tools immediately provide several alternative options of the image for you to choose from.\n\nThis iterative approach helps in selecting the best possible image and provides insights into how slight modifications in the prompt can lead to different outcomes. For example, generating “a sunset over a mountain range” multiple times might yield variations in colors, cloud formations, and lighting.\n\nMost AI image generators offer various settings that can be adjusted to fine-tune the output. These settings might include parameters like image resolution, style strength, and randomness. Spend time experimenting with these options to understand their impact on the generated images.\n\nFor example, increasing the resolution can provide more detail, while adjusting the style strength can change the visual aesthetics from subtle to pronounced. Some generators allow users to control the degree of randomness, influencing the uniqueness and variability of the images.\n\nSoftware like Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, or online editors can be used to tweak colors, adjust lighting, correct imperfections, and add finishing touches. For example, you can increase the vibrancy of colors, remove unwanted artifacts, or add shadows and highlights.\n\nPost-processing allows you to polish the AI-generated images, ensuring they meet your exact specifications and quality standards. This step is particularly important for professional applications demanding precision and high-quality visuals.\n\nVisit https://gptscript.ai to download GPTScript and start building today.

        "document": "As marketers leverage AI to develop images, understanding how to do so effectively (and legally) is a key challenge. To better understand how AI is changing the development of images and best practices, I sought insight from Grant Farhall, Chief Product Officer at Getty Images, a leading visual content creator and marketplace with three brands: Getty Images, iStock, and Unsplash.\n\nAs background on Getty Images, Farhall indicates that “Getty Images is in the business of visual storytelling. As a leading visual content creator and marketplace, our brands offer impactful visuals to help any brand, business, or organization communicate more effectively with their target audience and inspire that audience to take action. For nearly 30 years, we have covered global events ... and centered important conversations on the images we capture around the world, enabling fast, accurate visual reporting of events that drive the news cycle. We also maintain one of the largest and best privately owned archives in the world, filled with hundreds of millions of unique visual assets dating back to the beginning of photography.”\n\nHow AI is Changing the Development and Use of Images\n\nFarhall suggests that compelling visual content is critical for marketers to connect with brands with their audiences and that “generative AI potentially offers another option to craft those visuals in certain, appropriate contexts. However, the fundamental core of the creative process remains unchanged; talented individuals, equipped with the appropriate tools, are ultimately responsible for bringing new ideas to life. Generative AI is another instrument to help them channel their unique human creativity, like a new brush and canvas in their hands.\n\nWhile there are changes, much actually remains the same. To connect with audiences, brands must cut through an increasingly visually cluttered landscape, and they need to do that efficiently and at scale. Generative AI is one of many tools that marketers can use to achieve this, and in some exciting and innovative ways, but these new opportunities come alongside potential challenges.”\n\nFarhall acknowledges that AI poses significant benefits. “Generative AI allows users to create images that are very difficult or impossible to shoot with traditional means. And there have been striking, visually stunning examples of that. But there are also a lot of examples of low-quality images that are derivatives of pre-existing ideas, including blatant copies of images created without AI. At the end of the day, a ‘quality’ AI-generated image is one that helps someone reach and communicate to their audiences and is trained on quality and ‘clean’ data that is fully permissioned and clear of any risk to infringe on IP. Customers should not have to choose between creating quality AI visuals and legal safety; they should demand both.\n\nTo this end, the advent of AI image generation asks us to think differently about how to sustain a thriving future for creatives. AI is an exciting tool with a growing number of use cases, but the authenticity, diversity, creativity, and quality of human-created work are irreplicable and required to sustain effective AI models. In training our own generative AI model, Getty Images ensures that creators who have contributed to the dataset are compensated for their work on a recurring basis. Those AI services that have built their products through scraped data put the rights of artists and IP holders at risk. The potential erosion of these rights has immediate and long-term implications on the broader creative economy; without these rights, we limit the opportunity for people to conceive net-new ideas and be rewarded appropriately for them.\n\nWith the rise of AI, Farhall indicates that “we now live in a world where we cannot always be certain if the photos and videos we encounter are real or not. This has serious implications for brands as they seek to build and sustain trust with their customers, particularly in cases where authenticity sits at the core of the brand’s identity. Brands need to be thoughtful about when and how they use AI and the level of transparency they offer around it. AI is not new, but it has never been so widely accessible, and everyone is wrestling with the right way to use it.\n\nIn addition, image generators and other AI tools pose the greatest risk to businesses when they are not commercially safe and not based on a clean foundational model. A commercially safe AI tool is one that allows marketers to use the generated content to freely market a product without any downstream legal risks. This means a customer has a license to use the image commercially and legal indemnification to protect them.\n\nIn the context of image generation, commercially safe AI tools are those that are not trained on any copyrighted material or known likenesses. Therefore, you can’t get in legal trouble for violating copyright.\n\nMost AI content generators can’t tout this. Many have been trained on scraped data, which is ripped from the internet without legal consent, or synthetic data, which is generated by other AI tools that may have been trained on copyrighted material. This is why brands must be especially careful and demand full transparency from any third-party AI companies they’re working with. Training using public domain datasets may sound okay on the surface, but users should seek complete clarity on what those data sets were and the risks they present. That said, being trained on a clean dataset isn’t the only factor in commercial safety. Legal indemnification is crucial to the commercial safety equation, and it should extend to the generation, download and use of the content produced with a given tool. Otherwise, you still have holes in your proverbial ship.\n\nWhen working with an AI vendor for use of a third-party tool or AI-generated assets, businesses should hold those vendors to the highest standards. That requires thoroughly assessing its commercial safety. Marketers should ask vendors about how the data was trained and on what; usage rights; legal indemnification; and what a user would have to do with the image to lose legal coverage. With a commercially safe tool, they have the confidence to experiment with AI and unlock creativity without worrying about potential legal trouble down the line.\n\nAt Getty Images, we’ve created an AI tool that exists in a world without known brands and likenesses—it's completely impossible for users to violate intellectual property because the AI isn’t trained on any existing IP. We’ve built it solely on our permissioned, pre-shot creative library—what most people know as our ‘stock’ library—and include indemnification and perpetual, worldwide usage rights, automatically for visuals generated or modified using our AI services. You don’t have to ask for the asset to be reviewed or cleared because we know the visuals are legally safe.”\n\nBest Practices for CMOs When Using AI to Develop Images\n\nFarhall suggests that the starting point is to use “commercially safe” AI tools as they “can help brands create at a higher level in line with their unique needs, but aren’t a replacement for authentic, real-life imagery. CMOs and their marketing teams need to determine whether AI is the right tool for the job based on the audiences they are trying to reach and the message they want to land. Knowing when it’s appropriate to use AI-generated content perhaps more importantly, when it's not—can help marketers protect their brands’ reputation and maintain trust with consumers.\n\nWhere brands have formed trusted relationships with their customers based on authenticity, there may be elevated risk in using AI visuals, or else not being transparent about that use. Consider how worried you would be if your audience learned you are using AI to communicate with them. Ask yourself to what degree you are comfortable being transparent about that. If you are very worried about your customers’ potential reaction, it may call into question if AI is the right tool for that project.\n\nMarketers should also use pre-shot or custom-photographed content where they need to disclose the ages or identifying information of the models in the images; for example, liquor brands have to confirm that all models employed in a marketing campaign are over the age of 25, and you can’t confirm this in an AI-generated visual. In contrast, we can provide detailed model releases for all pre-shot creative visuals, including to confirm the ages of the people in those images.\n\nPrompting an AI generator takes time and creative thinking. Users and brands should ensure that their AI generations belong entirely to them and that they won’t be recycled into the training dataset for the tool they’re using or offered as stock creative assets for sale to other users. This keeps the integrity of their brand intact, as well as the integrity of their hard work.\n\nMarketing teams should also consider transparency when it comes to outputs. According to Getty Images’ VisualGPS data, 87% of consumers believe brands should disclose whether an image has been generated by AI. However, there are currently no laws in place requiring this, leaving it up to brands and marketers to use their best judgment and practice responsible disclosure until regulations can match the pace of AI tool development.”\n\nIn general, Farhall’s overall advice is to be “extremely discerning about the AI tools you’re using and to work with AI vendors that are fully transparent about their training data and processes, usage rights, and legal indemnification. Brands should be able to create in elevated ways that save them time, money and risk, and there should not be a tradeoff between creativity and protection.”"

        "document": "Just as with text-based AI tools, image generation tools such as Adobe Firefly rely on a user’s prompts to create good images. After you enter a prompt, the AI model analyzes your input and generates a response based on the patterns it has learned through its training. More descriptive prompts can improve the quality of the outputs. This guide gives you a basic overview of how to generate prompts for image-based AI tools.\n• As with text-based tools, before you start using an image-based AI tool for your Harvard work, you should be sure to review the University’s guidelines . Keep in mind that AI image tools can be extremely variable in quality and can produce offensive content, so be sure to carefully review any work containing AI content before you use or publish it.\n• Firefly is trained on Adobe Stock images, openly licensed content, and public domain content where copyright has expired, making it safe for use without infringing on copyright. For this reason, we recommend Harvard faculty, students, and staff use Firefly\n• Consider AI’s limitations: Just like text-based AI tools can “hallucinate,” image-based tools can add strange artifacts to your images, particularly when dealing with people or places. Look for things like bizarre expressions on the faces of people and animals, contorted bodies, additional fingers on hands, or features that look out of place in a particular location such as palm trees and sandy beaches in Harvard Yard.\n\nA basic formula of “subject + style + details + format of output” will get you started creating AI images. Keep adding more detail to get better results.\n\nDescribe the subject in as much detail as you can \n\n\n\nAsking AI to “draw a cat” is so broad that you’ll either get a very generic image or a wide variety of approaches:\n\nTo get something closer to what you want, ask yourself questions such as: What is the cat doing? What color is it? What mood is it in? Where is it and what is in the background? By adding these to your prompt you’ll get much closer to the image you’re imagining, e.g. “Draw a ginger-and-white striped cat looking excited as it chases a mouse around a kitchen”.\n\nSpecify the style of image \n\n\n\nGenerative AI can create images in the style of photographs, paintings, cartoons, illustrations, pencil drawings, and much more. You can even try specific artistic techniques such as pointillism, pop art, cubism, impressionism, etc. Try adding a style to your prompt, i.e. “Draw a ginger-and-white striped cat looking excited as it chases a mouse around a kitchen, in the style of an impressionist painter.”\n\nOther considerations like lighting, the positioning of the subject within the frame, background details, primary color scheme, degree of realism, and many more can help you refine your image to get closer to what you want. For example: \"Draw a ginger-and-white striped cat looking excited as it chases a mouse around a kitchen, in the style of an impressionist painter, with light streaming through the windows and prominent use of blue and yellow.\"\n\nAlso consider the format in which you want your image to be outputted, including orientation, aspect ratio, etc. or a particular use case, e.g. poster, email header image, social media post, etc.\n\nFirefly also includes a sidebar that enables you to toggle many of these elements on and off, including effects, style, lighting, composition, and more.

        "document": "Exploring the Use of AI University Communications and campus communicators have explored a variety of use cases for integrating generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) into marketing and communications work. We evaluated different uses and different tools and have crowdsourced our learnings. This document is meant to serve as a source of information and guidelines for University Communications staff as they explore the use of AI. The following are example use cases that showed potential for mid-to-high value:\n• Brainstorming and idea generation for various projects\n• Content versioning, including for A/B testing, such as alternate email subject lines\n• Research support, such as summarizing capabilities of tools, comparing/contrasting programs and defining terms Additional use cases were explored, including coding, writing stories, editing and image generation. These required more human intervention to deliver value, had higher levels of risk and/or delivered lower value. University Communications is continuing to evaluate use cases as tools progress.\n\nGenerative AI tools present exciting opportunities for those working in communications and marketing, offering innovative solutions to enhance our strategies and achieve greater success. These tools can assist in various aspects of our work, including content creation, data analysis, customer engagement, and more. By harnessing the power of AI, we can streamline our processes, gain deeper insights into audience behavior and deliver more personalized and effective communications to our target audiences. Embracing AI in our work will enable us to adapt to the rapidly evolving landscape of communications and marketing. Things to Keep in Mind AI tools offer numerous opportunities for communications and marketing professionals, but it's essential to be aware of certain concerns and considerations when incorporating them into our work. Here are some of the key points to keep in mind:\n• Data Privacy and Ethics: There is a need to handle all data with the utmost care. Ensure that your AI solutions adhere to data protection regulations, maintain transparency in data usage and follow ethical guidelines to respect user privacy.\n• Bias and Fairness: AI systems can inherit biases from the data they are trained on. It's crucial to be vigilant about potential biases in AI-generated content or decision-making processes to avoid unintended discrimination or misrepresentation.\n• Quality Control: While AI can automate many tasks, human oversight is still crucial. Always review and edit AI-generated content to ensure it aligns with the brand's voice, values and quality standards.\n• Over-Reliance on AI: AI tools are supportive but should not replace human creativity, strategic thinking and intuition. It's important to strike a balance and use AI as a tool to augment, not replace, human expertise.\n• Flexibility and Adaptability: AI tools and technologies are continually evolving. Stay adaptable and be prepared to adjust strategies as new AI innovations emerge.\n• User Agreements and Terms of Service: It’s important to be aware of specific tools’ terms of service and user agreements prior to their use. This clarifies how generated output can be used and helps avoid potential violation of the user agreement. In some cases, this will mean a paid version of a tool is necessary to obtain the user rights necessary. By being mindful of these considerations and taking appropriate measures, communications and marketing professionals can harness the power of AI tools while mitigating potential risks.\n• Large Language Model (LLM): A large language model is a sophisticated computer program that can understand and generate human-like text. It's trained on vast amounts of written language to assist with tasks like answering questions, writing content or having conversations with people. Examples of LLMs include GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and LAMDA.\n• ChatGPT: ChatGPT is a chatbot interface for the GPT LLM. Tools such as ChatGPT have limitations. For one, GPT-3.5 was trained on data available prior to September 2021 and GPT-4 was released in March 2023, with an updated knowledge base extending to September 2023. ChatGPT cannot access the internet to report on live events. LLM models also inherit biases from the datasets on which they were trained. In addition, they will tend to fill in information gaps with information that may not be accurate, and they don’t always get math correct. This means the tools can’t be relied upon to generate information that doesn’t have inaccuracies. When using the tools, take that into consideration and don't assume the information they present is entirely accurate. Users also need to consider audience expectations and ethics regarding content creation and presentation using AI tools. Use caution when asking ChatGPT to do something a person doesn’t understand or can’t verify. A person who doesn’t have development skills may not know the risks of generating code, for example. Or someone who isn’t familiar with SEO may not know the output will not make SEO better. AI is a fast-moving, fast-changing area of technology. Government officials are still determining how best to regulate the technology. The European Union is working on regulations for use. An executive order was issued by President Biden regarding platform testing with implications on use by federal employees in October 2023, and future legislation is possible. MSU will continue to monitor developments and will update recommendations, as necessary.\n\nFollow MSU IT’s guidance on use of generative AI MSU IT has posted Interim Guidance on Data Uses and Risks of Generative AI on the tech.msu.edu website. These cover MSU’s expectations regarding use of AI platforms from an IT perspective. IMPORTANT: Please take specific note of the guidelines section regarding data stewardship. There are specific instructions regarding institutional regulations and requirements pertaining to use of data with AI tools. Practice and experiment to build skill in writing AI prompts. Creating successful prompts in chat interfaces with AI tools is a learned skill. Better prompts yield better responses. There are tricks and nuances involved in how you instruct the tool using your input to supply a quality output. Many online articles provide tips on how to craft good prompts. You can also ask the tool for tips on how to improve your prompts or combine tools to craft quality prompts. For example, ask ChatGPT how to improve your prompts for Midjourney. Ask ChatGPT to tell you what it needs to know to create a quality output. Suggest the tool take on a persona, such as a prospective college student, in its response. Practice and learn through experience. Over time you may develop a standard set of prompt language to “train” the tool to answer in the way you would like. Be aware of copyright limitations and terms of service. Read the terms of service for any tools you’re using to determine whether your output is protected. By default, treat any AI-generated content as not eligible for copyright. There is still debate as to who can “own” the copyright on AI content, due in part to uncertainty about whether the data used to train the LLMs included copyrighted material and whether a computer can be considered an “author” under the Copyright Act.\n\nAI tools can take notes and summarize meetings, when appropriate. AI meeting assistants often take notes and summarize meetings. This can be very helpful. However, they do not always get things correct. Additionally, any documentation these tools generate is subject to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. Do not use AI tools that generate meeting notes and summaries in meetings that cover confidential or sensitive topics. For meetings when the tool is used, do not disseminate notes or summaries without first reviewing. If the tool automatically shares notes or summaries with attendees, review these and provide clarifications or corrections as soon as possible via email to all recipients. Build trust with colleagues by alerting all meeting attendees and obtaining consent. If using an AI tool in a meeting, start the meeting by notifying attendees that you’d like to use the tool. Explain what the tool does and request consent from all attendees to use the tool. Do not rely on chatbot notifications to attendees as a form of consent. If anyone objects, do not use the AI tool in the meeting. AI tools are powerful but vary in their degree of activity. Read the fine print. Some AI meeting tools take notes and summarize meetings. Some go further, providing insights to the tool user into meeting attendees’ behavior (e.g., camera on/off) and engagement (e.g., eye contact, body language). Make people aware of the tools being used and use your best judgement on which are appropriate for your circumstances.\n\nUse an AI tool as a first pass at editing, and then review any recommendations in the context of MSU’s brand voice and style requirements. AI tools for editing, such as Grammarly or the grammar check built into word processing tools, default to their own editorial standards. These guidelines do not always match the MSU Editorial Style Guide. For example, many use the Oxford comma, which is not used for MSU nonacademic content. For more information on the editorial style guide, see the University Communications website. AI tools can assist with generating early drafts of writing. AI tools, such as ChatGPT, can help with initial drafts of written content. Any material written or drafted using an AI tool must be reviewed for factual accuracy. For stories involving research work, ask the involved researcher(s) to review the final draft to ensure accuracy. For AI-generated bios and profiles, the subject of the bio should review the content. AI tools lack human context, so use sensitivity as to when AI-generated content is appropriate. Public attitudes towards AI vary and are not always favorable. There have been instances of negative public reaction to its use in some circumstances, such as using AI to generate condolence messaging after crisis situations. Additionally, some studies show the reliance on AI for messaging leads to a decrease in trust in the messaging. Consider your audience and context before using AI for messages.\n\nAI tools can create images that can then be modified and polished for publishing. AI tools can create some amazing imagery that can accompany stories and designs, but the images are not perfect. You can expect to need multiple rounds of edits to fine-tune your image using prompts, and possible further editing using other traditional tools, such as Photoshop. Provide high quality prompts that may include various forms of visual material. Do not publish without review and adjustment to fix the kinds of imperfections often found in AI images. Care should be taken to use only professional versions of AI tools such as Midjourney or Dall-E, so that terms of service allow for MSU to use the image in publications. AI-generated images can be great design elements, but context is key to their presentation. We want to maintain the trust of our audience, so we need to be judicious with how AI-generated images are presented. Any image created using AI should not be used as illustration or art within a context that implies the image represents reality. AI images should not be positioned to represent a real location, person, etc. If an image is used for illustrative purposes within a context that could cause confusion (e.g., with a news article or informational content), labeling should be considered. Avoid using AI to generate images of individuals without their expressed consent. AI tools can speed up video and audio transcription and captioning processes. AI-generated transcription and caption tools can drastically speed up the process of captioning videos. However, these tools are not perfect. The transcript and caption files should be reviewed for accuracy before adding to the video file. Use of generative AI to create depictions of Sparty is not permitted. While certain alterations of the approved Sparty mascot illustration have been permitted to represent our various athletics teams and for use on licensed products, development of these altered marks is carefully overseen by University Licensing Programs, which must approve their development. Sparty the mascot (and images thereof) is a trademark of the university and should not be altered in any way without permission. Sparty is one of the most recognizable collegiate symbols in the world, and while generative AI may make it easy to place him in various settings with custom apparel augmentations or other props, this is not permitted. University units may book the Sparty mascot for photo shoots and the resulting images may be used for communications and promotional purposes. Units wishing to use Sparty in this way should first consider if this imagery will best support the messaging and tone of their communication. Information about booking Sparty may be found at https://alumni.msu.edu/sparty/appearance-request.cfm."
