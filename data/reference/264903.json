        "document": "In this article you'll see how to style a button using CSS.\n\nMy goal here is mostly to showcase how different CSS rules and styles are applied and used. We won't see much design inspiration nor will we discuss ideas for styling.\n\nInstead, this will be more of an overview of how the styles themselves work, what properties are commonly used, and how they can be combined.\n\nYou'll first see how to create a button in HTML. Then you'll learn how to override the default styles of buttons. Lastly, you'll get a glimpse of how to style buttons for their three different states.\n\nHow to Create a Button in HTML\n\nTo create a button, use the element.\n\nThis is a more accessible and semantic option compared to using a generic container which is created with the element.\n\nIn the file below, I've created the basic structure for a webpage and added a single button:\n• You first add the button element, which consists of an opening and closing tag.\n• The attribute in the opening tag explicitly creates a clickable button. Since this particular button is not used for submitting a form, it is useful for semantic reasons to add it in order to make the code clearer and not trigger any unwanted actions.\n• The attribute will be used to style the button in a separate CSS file. The value could be any other name you choose. For example you could have used .\n• The text is the visible text inside the button.\n\nAny styles that will be applied to the button will go inside a spearate file.\n\nYou can apply the styles to the HTML content by linking the two files together. You do this with the tag which was used in .\n\nIn the file, I've added some styling which only centers the button in the middle of the browser window.\n\nNotice that the is used with the selector. This is a way to apply styles directly to the button.\n\nThe code from above will result in the following:\n\nThe default styling of buttons will vary depending on the browser you're using.\n\nThis is an example of how the native styles for buttons look on the Google Chrome browser.\n\nHow to Change the Default Styling of Buttons\n\nHow to Change the Background Color of Buttons\n\nTo change the background color of the button, use the CSS property and give it a value of a color of your taste.\n\nIn the selector, you use to change the background color of the button.\n\nHow to Change the Text Color of Buttons\n\nThe default color of text is black, so when you add a dark background color you will notice that the text has disappeared.\n\nAnother thing to make sure of is that there is enough contrast between the button's background color and text color. This helps make the text more readable and easy on the eyes.\n\nNext, use the property to change the color of text:\n\nHow to Change the Border Style of Buttons\n\nNotice the grey around the edges of the button? That is the default color of the button's borders.\n\nOne way to fix this is to use the property. You set the value to be the same as the value of . This makes sure the borders have the same color as the background of the button.\n\nAnother way would be to remove the border around the button entirely by using .\n\nNext, you can also round-up the edges of the button by using the property, like so:\n\nYou could also add a slight dark shadow effect around the button by using the property:\n\nHow to Change the Size of Buttons\n\nThe way to create more space inside the button's borders is to increase the of the button.\n\nBelow I added a value of 15px for the top, bottom, right, and left padding of the button.\n\nI also set a minimum height and width, with the and properties respectively. Buttons need to be large enough for all different kind of devices.\n\nButtons have three different states:\n\nIt's best that the three states are styled differently and don't share the same styles.\n\nIn the following sections I'll give a brief explanation on what each one of the states mean and what triggers them. You'll also see some ways you can style the button for each separate state.\n\nThe state becomes present when a user hovers over a button, by bringing their mouse or trackpad over it, without selecting it or clicking on it.\n\nTo change the button's styles when you hover over it, use the CSS pseudoclass selector.\n\nA common change to make with is switching the background-color of the button.\n\nTo make the change less sudden, pair with the property.\n\nThe property will help make the transition from no state to a state much smoother.\n\nThe change of background color will happen a bit slower than it would without the property. This will also help make the end result less jarring for the user.\n\nIn the example above, I used a Hex color code value to make the background color a lighter shade for when I hover over the button.\n\nWith the help of the property I also caused a delay of when the transition from no state to a state happens. This caused a slower transition from the original background color to the background color.\n\nKeep in mind that the pseudoclass does not work for mobile device screens and mobile apps. Choose to use hover effects only for desktop web applications and not touch screens.\n\nThe state takes effect for keyboard users - specifically it will activate when you focus on a button by hitting the key ( ).\n\nIf you're following along, when you focus on the button after pressing the key, you'll see the following:\n\nNotice the slight light blue outline around the button when it's gained focus?\n\nBrowsers have default styling for the pseudoclass, for accessibility keyboard navigation purposes. It's not a good idea to remove that altogether.\n\nYou can however create custom styles for it and make it easily detectable.\n\nA way to do so is by setting the outline color to first be .\n\nFollowing that, you can maintain the to . Lastly, using the property, you can add a color of your liking for when the element is focused on:\n\nYou can also again pair these styles with the property, depending on the effect you want to achieve:\n\nHow to Style for the State\n\nThe state gets activated when you click on the button by either clicking the computer's mouse or pressing down on the laptop's trackpad.\n\nThat being said, look at what happens when I click the button after I've applied and kept the styles for the and states:\n\nThe state styles are applied before clicking when I hover over the button.\n\nThe state styles are applied also, because when a button is clicked it also gains a state alongside an one.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that they are not the same thing.\n\nstate is when an element is being focused on and is when a user on an element by holding and pressing down on it.\n\nTo change the style for when a user clicks a button, apply styles to the CSS pseudoselector.\n\nIn this case, I've changed the background color of the button when a user clicks on it\n\nAnd there you have it! You now know the basics of how to style a button with CSS.\n\nWe went over how to change the background color and text color of buttons as well as how to style buttons for their different states.\n\nTo learn more about web design, check out freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification.

Here is a beautiful social media button icon you can use on your site. These CSS button hover effects are used as social media buttons for sharing content on social media platforms. The smooth ease effects make the buttons more interactive. HTML:\n\nSee the Pen Social Media Transition button hover Effect by Ocxigin (@ocxigin) on CodePen.\n\nSVGs elements can serve as a good source for animating buttons or any other web elements. The example below shows how an SVG element is used to animate the border of a button element by setting the SVG stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset as the element border. This can be used as a hero-image overlay button, as seen below. This CSS button hover effect can serve as a quick response for users to access the product or services of a page. HTML:\n\nSee the Pen \n\n SVG stroke Animated Hover Effect by Ocxigin (@ocxigin)\n\n on CodePen.\n\nThe pressdown CSS button hover effect is made by creating multiple box-shadow values and offsetting each value by one.\n\nTo send information to a server or sign in to a user on a platform, you need a good button design that conveys such information. We can use this type of button for submitting data to a server.\n\nSee the Pen \n\n Pressdown button hover effect by Ocxigin (@ocxigin)\n\n on CodePen.\n\nThe split button sides is one of the simple CSS button hover effects where the right and left border is removed on hover.\n\nJust like the pressdown button, we can use this button for sending requests to a server. That is as a submit or sign-in and sign-out button.\n\nSee the Pen \n\n Spilt button sides hover effect by Ocxigin (@ocxigin)\n\n on CodePen.\n\nThe flip background gradient effect is set to flip the background gradient on mouse hover.\n\nThis CSS button hover effect can be used as a subscribe button on a company newsletter. Subscribe button usually requires a large and interactive button to drive engagements.\n\nSee the Pen \n\n flip background gradient effect by Ocxigin (@ocxigin)\n\n on CodePen.\n\nBackground transition is one of the best CSS button hover effects. Transitions smooth the way two elements blend together. We can add background transitions to icon buttons. This will help transition the background of the button as the user hovers over the icon.\n\nThis is a social media button, used for sharing web content across multiple social media platforms.\n\nSee the Pen \n\n Background transition Hover Button Effect by Ocxigin (@ocxigin)\n\n on CodePen.\n\nApplying buttons to cards is yet another popular CSS button hover effect.

Which web visitors can click on to learn more about the user on each card.\n\nSee the Pen \n\n profile card hover effect by Ocxigin (@ocxigin)\n\n on CodePen.\n\nThe gradient animated CSS button hover effects take multiple colors as linear-gradients, and the background-size is offset by 500% and re-position with the background-position. To get the animation effect, the position state is animated.\n\nThis can be used as a CTAs or hero image overlay button and is best applied on a landing page, navbar, or footer.\n\nSee the Pen \n\n Gradient Animated Hover Button by Ocxigin (@ocxigin)\n\n on CodePen.\n\nThe button hover pop-up effect, pops the buttons up when a user hovers on them. These buttons have four different styles:\n• Window slide: The left and right background is slided from the x-axis on mouse hover.\n• Pop up: Pops the button up with a dox-shadow on mouse hover.\n• Slide in: The top and bottom background slides from the y-axis on mouse hover.\n\nThese popup CSS button hover effects can be used as user-interaction buttons on a web page, for example linking pages together such as pagination.\n\nSee the Pen \n\n Popup button hover effect by Ocxigin (@ocxigin)\n\n on CodePen.\n\nThe offset background button is yet another one of the best CSS button hover effects that offset the background button on mouse hover.\n\nThis effect can be used as a submit button, CTAs, hero image buttons, user-interaction buttons, etc.\n\nSee the Pen \n\n Offset background button hover effect by Ocxigin (@ocxigin)\n\n on CodePen.\n\nWith the swipe left, and right button hover effect, two pseudo-element is created with each positioned left and right respectively and on mouse hover each element grows to fit the button as a background.\n\nThis CSS button hover effect is used as a hero image overlay button. It can also be used as submitting buttons, download or subscribe buttons.\n\nSee the Pen \n\n Swipe left and right button hover effect by Ocxigin (@ocxigin)\n\n on CodePen.\n\nThe animated border gradient hover effect is considered one of the simplest CSS button hover effects where the first and second border of the button element is transformed on mouse hover. The first element has the border transform, while the second has the background transformed on mouse hover.\n\nThese buttons are very useful as user-interaction buttons, CTAs, submit buttons, subscribe buttons, sign in or sign out buttons.\n\nSee the Pen \n\n Animated Border Gradient Hover Effect by Ocxigin (@ocxigin)\n\n on CodePen.\n\nBorder wipe stands as a popular choice among CSS button hover effects.

These buttons can be used to make action on the cards.\n\nSee the Pen \n\n Price-list-card-components by Ocxigin (@ocxigin)\n\n on CodePen.\n\nThis article lists the 41 best CSS button hover effects in 2025 that you can use as a web designer to improve your website and how visitors or users interact with button elements on your website or mobile apps.\n\nWebsites or apps are built with different functions to enable users to perform tasks, and buttons are the interface we use to interact, get, send, or delete requests or tasks on the Internet. This makes buttons a critical aspect of user experience.\n\nThis user experience can be improved by designing buttons in such a way that it is distinguishable from other elements and interactive hover effects that respond and give the users a sense of interaction when they hover on them.\n\nDesigning buttons from scratch can be complex, or choosing from an already made design. To fix this, you can create a basic design with interactive CSS button hover effects, or you can experiment and combine different hover effects from different unique designs from multiple sources."

        "document": "When I first learned the basics of HTML & CSS in 2014, building a website header was one of those scary and difficult tasks for me. Flexbox was still new and we were forced to use old methods like and the clearfix technique. Today, the scene is completely different. Flexbox is widely supported and that opens up a lot of possibilities for us.\n\nSome might argue that it’s easy nowadays to make a website header as we have modern CSS layout techniques. That’s not the case as there are some interesting challenges to tackle. I will try to highlight some of them.\n\nIn this article, I will explain how we can use CSS flexbox to successfully build a website header, and show you some of the important tips and tricks. In the end, there will be a project that was made especially for this article. Keep reading till the end as you’re in for a treat!\n\nThis article assumes that you have basic knowledge in flexbox. If you’re interested, I wrote an introduction article about flexbox on my blog.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure that we both are on the same page. A website header is one of the first things that the user sees when visiting a website. Usually, it contains the logo or website name, with the navigation links. Consider the following figure:\n\nRegardless of the visual design for a header, the key elements are the logo and navigation.\n\nWhen flexbox is applied to the header element, it will make all the child items in the same line. Then, all you need is to apply to distribute the spacing between them.\n\nIt’s easy, right? For such a use-case, yes it is. It can get more complex than that.\n\nThe header above doesn’t have an inner wrapper that contains its logo and navigation elements. This can cause problems on large screens.\n\nNotice how the first header is too wide because it doesn’t have an inner wrapper. While the second one looks much better. For that reason, the HTML needs to be tweaked as below.\n\nAnd the flexbox should be moved to the element.\n\nThis will act as a defensive CSS method. When the screen is small, there is a possibility of horizontal scrolling. See the figure below:\n\nWithout being set, there will be a horizontal scrolling. Make sure to include it!\n\nWhat I like about using flexbox is that it makes it easy to handle multiple variations of a header design. Based on the previous header design, I explored some options for the header element like adding a button, search input, and changing the order of the child items.\n\nLet’s explore how to implement them with flexbox.\n\nI added a button next to the navigation links. How this should be handled? Should we add it inside the navigation as a link? Or it should be separated from the navigation? I would go for this.\n\nIn that case, the spacing can’t be done with . Instead, I will use for navigation. It will push it and the button to the far right.\n\nSeparating the navigation and the track button is useful for mobile, as we will need to keep the button and show a mobile toggle button next to it.\n\nSimilar to the first variation, this one has a search input that is taking the remaining available space. With flexbox, this can be achieved by using the property.\n\nAnd you are done! Now, the search input will fill the available space between the brand and the navigation. However, this has some limitations. On smaller viewports, the header will look like the below.\n\nThe search input width shouldn’t be less than that, as it will be hard to type and see the full text. See the below for some solutions:\n\nI like the second solution better as it doesn’t hide the navigation very early. Generally speaking, I try to avoid hiding an element if it doesn’t affect the layout.\n\nFor this one, the HTML markup is the same, but the visual order of the header items is different. How we can achieve that? You might be thinking that using can solve this, right?\n\nThe solution for this is to give each child item a . This will distribute the available space between them.\n\nSomething weird happened to the button element. It became too big because of . The only way to fix this is by wrapping it into another element.\n\nWith that, we can center both the logo and the button below.\n\nKeep in mind that this approach can easily fail in case more navigation links were added. You need to make sure that the number of navigation links won’t exceed a specific limit. Here is an example with the logo being off the center.\n\nAs you see in the figure above, the logo is not centered. So that’s something to keep in mind to avoid such an unexpected issue.\n\nNow that I explored some different header designs and how to build them, let’s move on to some important concepts that can help us while building a header.\n\nUseful tips for building a header with Flexbox\n\nI like to use in case an element needs to take the full width on mobile, such as important navigation that can’t be hidden.\n\nFrom the mockup above, it might sound straightforward. In reality, it’s not. Usually, a header might have an inner spacing (padding), and when we force an item to take the full width, it won’t happen unless the padding is cleared. However, it’s not practical to remove the padding as it will affect other elements in the design.\n\nHere is a workaround of fixing this:\n• Change its in case it’s needed. Sometimes, there might be other elements and we want to make sure that the navigation is the last one.\n• Add the negative with a value equal to the header padding. This will make the navigation take the full width.\n• Add to the navigation, this will add some breathing space.\n• And finally, I used to center the navigation items (Not important).\n\nAnd here is a visual walkthrough of the process.\n\nWith the flex property being supported in Chrome and Firefox, it’s now easier than ever to add spacing between flex items. Consider the following header:\n\nTo add the highlighted spacing, all you need is adding to the flex parent. Without the , we will need to the spacing in the old way.\n\nBeware that you need to make a fallback when using the property. I wrote a detailed article on that topic.\n\nThat’s all for this article. Let me show you the thing I made!\n\nI got the idea of designing and implementing a blueprint website header components. The reason is that I can pick one and use it for a new project pretty quickly. I made 17 headers so far and aiming for more in the coming weeks. While working on them, I tried to focus on the following:\n• Used Sass so they can be easily edited (Still need to do some refactoring here and there)\n• Accessibility (Please open an issue if you spot something incorrectly)\n\nCheck them out on headers-css.vercel.app or Github.\n\nI’m excited to let you know that I’m writing an ebook about Debugging CSS.\n\nIf you’re interested, head over to debuggingcss.com and subscribe for updates about the book."

        "document": "No doubt the best way to learn how to code is by building things.\n\nOver the past 60 days, I have been showing up daily for an average of three hours per day, using the #100DaysOfCode challenge, in my quest to upskill, build web apps, and grow my confidence as a web developer.\n\nSo, beginning today, I am sharing here what I have learned (and currently learning) in learning about responsive web design — starting with building a responsive nav using CSS Flexbox.\n\nWhat do I hope to accomplish?\n\nHere’s what I will be building at the end of this tutorial. A responsive nav in mobile, tablet, and large screen view.\n\nThe nav will display as a column in a small screen device.\n\nI will be making use of the following CSS to accomplish this:\n• The media query to target the screen size.\n\nI begin first by importing the Google of and to the top of the stylesheet file.\n\nYou can select a Google font for use from here.\n\nThe imported font can then be used like so:\n\nNOTE: I used font even though I imported two font-family types from Google font.\n\nNext, I use CSS custom properties to define the colors I will be using.\n\nThis approach helps to make quick changes to the properties of the nav (or web app) like , , whenever you wish to.\n\nHerein, lies the application of CSS variables.\n\nNow I can style the background color of the body using CSS variables like so:\n\nNoticed, I don’t have to use the CSS color value on the , but the variable declared in the custom property.\n\nThe class is the parent of our nav. I am styling the container to a fixed height of 70px, setting the , and .\n\nThe CSS is used to create a flex container. Immediately we do , on the navbar class, all direct children of the class, become flex items.\n\nYou should see this on your screen at this point.\n\nNow we have to also target the child of the to make it a flexbox also.\n\nWe do this like so:\n\nWe can now use the justify-content property to align the items — , , — on the main axis.\n\nThe property takes either of these values — , , , .\n\nLearn more about justify-content on the MDN docs here.\n\nHere’s the other part of the codes to give the nav a visual appeal.\n\nAt this point, your nav should be like the cover image of this article, on your large screen.\n\nUsing media queries to target the small screen size\n\nMedia queries are a vital part of responsive web design. With media queries, you can target the viewport size of the user device screen and set styles accordingly.\n\nThe syntax for the media query looks like so:\n\nSo let’s target a small screen size of 390 and 767px, to make the nav responsive on a mobile device.\n\nYou can find the complete code on GitHub and of the nav on codepen below.\n\nThanks for reading and if you find this article inspiring, please give it some claps so others can see it and share it on Twitter.\n\nYou can find the complete code on GitHub\n\nYou can also follow me on Twitter."

        "document": "The (Flexible Box) module (a W3C Candidate Recommendation as of October 2017) aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word “flex”). The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow. Most importantly, the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed to the regular layouts (block which is vertically-based and inline which is horizontally-based). While those work well for pages, they lack flexibility (no pun intended) to support large or complex applications (especially when it comes to orientation changing, resizing, stretching, shrinking, etc.). Note: Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of an application, and small-scale layouts, while the Grid layout is intended for larger scale layouts.\n\nSince flexbox is a whole module and not a single property, it involves a lot of things including its whole set of properties. Some of them are meant to be set on the container (parent element, known as “flex container”) whereas the others are meant to be set on the children (said “flex items”). If “regular” layout is based on both block and inline flow directions, the flex layout is based on “flex-flow directions”. Please have a look at this figure from the specification, explaining the main idea behind the flex layout. Items will be laid out following either the (from to ) or the cross axis (from to ).\n• main axis – The main axis of a flex container is the primary axis along which flex items are laid out. Beware, it is not necessarily horizontal; it depends on the property (see below).\n• main-start | main-end – The flex items are placed within the container starting from main-start and going to main-end.\n• main size – A flex item’s width or height, whichever is in the main dimension, is the item’s main size. The flex item’s main size property is either the ‘width’ or ‘height’ property, whichever is in the main dimension.\n• cross axis – The axis perpendicular to the main axis is called the cross axis. Its direction depends on the main axis direction.\n• cross-start | cross-end – Flex lines are filled with items and placed into the container starting on the cross-start side of the flex container and going toward the cross-end side.\n• cross size – The width or height of a flex item, whichever is in the cross dimension, is the item’s cross size. The cross size property is whichever of ‘width’ or ‘height’ that is in the cross dimension.\n\nThis defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the given value. It enables a flex context for all its direct children. Note that CSS columns have no effect on a flex container. \n\nThis establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container. Flexbox is (aside from optional wrapping) a single-direction layout concept. Think of flex items as primarily laying out either in horizontal rows or vertical columns.\n• (default): left to right in ; right to left in\n• : right to left in ; left to right in\n• : same as but top to bottom\n• : same as but bottom to top By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this property.\n• (default): all flex items will be on one line\n• : flex items will wrap onto multiple lines, from top to bottom.\n• : flex items will wrap onto multiple lines from bottom to top. There are some visual demos of here. This is a shorthand for the and properties, which together define the flex container’s main and cross axes. The default value is . \n\nThis defines the alignment along the main axis. It helps distribute extra free space leftover when either all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size. It also exerts some control over the alignment of items when they overflow the line.\n• (default): items are packed toward the start of the flex-direction.\n• : items are packed toward the end of the flex-direction.\n• : items are packed toward the start of the direction.\n• : items are packed toward the end of the direction.\n• : items are packed toward left edge of the container, unless that doesn’t make sense with the , then it behaves like .\n• : items are packed toward right edge of the container, unless that doesn’t make sense with the , then it behaves like .\n• : items are centered along the line\n• : items are evenly distributed in the line; first item is on the start line, last item on the end line\n• : items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around them. Note that visually the spaces aren’t equal, since all the items have equal space on both sides. The first item will have one unit of space against the container edge, but two units of space between the next item because that next item has its own spacing that applies.\n• : items are distributed so that the spacing between any two items (and the space to the edges) is equal. Note that that browser support for these values is nuanced. For example, never got support from some versions of Edge, and start/end/left/right aren’t in Chrome yet. MDN has detailed charts. The safest values are , , and . There are also two additional keywords you can pair with these values: and . Using ensures that however you do this type of positioning, you can’t push an element such that it renders off-screen (e.g. off the top) in such a way the content can’t be scrolled too (called “data loss”). \n\nThis defines the default behavior for how flex items are laid out along the cross axis on the current line. Think of it as the version for the cross-axis (perpendicular to the main-axis).\n• / / : items are placed at the start of the cross axis. The difference between these is subtle, and is about respecting the rules or the rules.\n• / / : items are placed at the end of the cross axis. The difference again is subtle and is about respecting rules vs. rules.\n• : items are centered in the cross-axis\n• : items are aligned such as their baselines align The and modifier keywords can be used in conjunction with all the rest of these keywords (although note browser support), and deal with helping you prevent aligning elements such that the content becomes inaccessible. \n\nThis aligns a flex container’s lines within when there is extra space in the cross-axis, similar to how aligns individual items within the main-axis. Note: This property only takes effect on multi-line flexible containers, where is set to either or ). A single-line flexible container (i.e. where is set to its default value, ) will not reflect .\n• (default): items are packed in their default position as if no value was set.\n• / : items packed to the start of the container. The (more supported) honors the while honors the direction.\n• / : items packed to the end of the container. The (more support) honors the while end honors the direction.\n• : items evenly distributed; the first line is at the start of the container while the last one is at the end\n• : items evenly distributed with equal space around each line\n• : items are evenly distributed with equal space around them\n• : lines stretch to take up the remaining space The and modifier keywords can be used in conjunction with all the rest of these keywords (although note browser support), and deal with helping you prevent aligning elements such that the content becomes inaccessible. The property explicitly controls the space between flex items. It applies that spacing only between items not on the outer edges. The behavior could be thought of as a minimum gutter, as if the gutter is bigger somehow (because of something like ) then the gap will only take effect if that space would end up smaller. It is not exclusively for flexbox, works in grid and multi-column layout as well. \n\nBy default, flex items are laid out in the source order. However, the property controls the order in which they appear in the flex container. Items with the same revert to source order. \n\nThis defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the item should take up. If all items have set to , the remaining space in the container will be distributed equally to all children. If one of the children has a value of , that child would take up twice as much of the space as either one of the others (or it will try, at least). This defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary. This defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed. It can be a length (e.g. 20%, 5rem, etc.) or a keyword. The keyword means “look at my width or height property” (which was temporarily done by the keyword until deprecated). The keyword means “size it based on the item’s content” – this keyword isn’t well supported yet, so it’s hard to test and harder to know what its brethren , , and do. If set to , the extra space around content isn’t factored in. If set to , the extra space is distributed based on its value. See this graphic. This is the shorthand for and combined. The second and third parameters ( and ) are optional. The default is , but if you set it with a single number value, like , that changes the to 0%, so it’s like setting . It is recommended that you use this shorthand property rather than set the individual properties. The shorthand sets the other values intelligently. \n\nThis allows the default alignment (or the one specified by ) to be overridden for individual flex items. Please see the explanation to understand the available values. Note that , and have no effect on a flex item.\n\nFlexbox requires some vendor prefixing to support the most browsers possible. It doesn’t just include prepending properties with the vendor prefix, but there are actually entirely different property and value names. This is because the Flexbox spec has changed over time, creating an “old”, “tweener”, and “new” versions. Perhaps the best way to handle this is to write in the new (and final) syntax and run your CSS through Autoprefixer, which handles the fallbacks very well. Alternatively, here’s a Sass to help with some of the prefixing, which also gives you an idea of what kind of things need to be done:\n\nLet’s start with a very very simple example, solving an almost daily problem: perfect centering. It couldn’t be any simpler if you use flexbox. .parent { display: flex; height: 300px; /* Or whatever */ } .child { width: 100px; /* Or whatever */ height: 100px; /* Or whatever */ margin: auto; /* Magic! */ } This relies on the fact a margin set to in a flex container absorb extra space. So setting a margin of will make the item perfectly centered in both axes. Now let’s use some more properties. Consider a list of 6 items, all with fixed dimensions, but can be auto-sized. We want them to be evenly distributed on the horizontal axis so that when we resize the browser, everything scales nicely, and without media queries. .flex-container { /* We first create a flex layout context */ display: flex; /* Then we define the flow direction and if we allow the items to wrap * Remember this is the same as: * flex-direction: row; * flex-wrap: wrap; */ flex-flow: row wrap; /* Then we define how is distributed the remaining space */ justify-content: space-around; } Done. Everything else is just some styling concern. Below is a pen featuring this example. Be sure to go to CodePen and try resizing your windows to see what happens. Let’s try something else. Imagine we have a right-aligned navigation element on the very top of our website, but we want it to be centered on medium-sized screens and single-columned on small devices. Easy enough. /* Large */ .navigation { display: flex; flex-flow: row wrap; /* This aligns items to the end line on main-axis */ justify-content: flex-end; } /* Medium screens */ @media all and (max-width: 800px) { .navigation { /* When on medium sized screens, we center it by evenly distributing empty space around items */ justify-content: space-around; } } /* Small screens */ @media all and (max-width: 500px) { .navigation { /* On small screens, we are no longer using row direction but column */ flex-direction: column; } } Let’s try something even better by playing with flex items flexibility! What about a mobile-first 3-columns layout with full-width header and footer. And independent from source order. .wrapper { display: flex; flex-flow: row wrap; } /* We tell all items to be 100% width, via flex-basis */ .wrapper > * { flex: 1 100%; } /* We rely on source order for mobile-first approach * in this case: * 1. header * 2. article * 3. aside 1 * 4. aside 2 * 5. footer */ /* Medium screens */ @media all and (min-width: 600px) { /* We tell both sidebars to share a row */ .aside { flex: 1 auto; } } /* Large screens */ @media all and (min-width: 800px) { /* We invert order of first sidebar and main * And tell the main element to take twice as much width as the other two sidebars */ .main { flex: 3 0px; } .aside-1 { order: 1; } .main { order: 2; } .aside-2 { order: 3; } .footer { order: 4; } }"

People nowadays expect some level of interactivity when they visit websites. One of the ways you can keep them engaged is by adding hover animations to your websites. There’s no limit to the type of hover animation you could make. It could be a simple button that scales up on hover or a card that flips over 3D-style — the possibilities are endless. In this article, we will explore 40 examples of CSS hover animations—ten of which I created myself 🙃. Hopefully, these examples help you draw inspiration and give you ideas for how to keep users engaged and provide them with a memorable experience. Let’s dive in. Let’s start by taking a look at ten custom animations I personally created, complete with demos and code examples!\n\nThe same height cards animation by Veronica is another great example. When hovered over, the cards enlarge slightly and reveal more information about the items, such as a \"like\" icon and time information. At the same time, the image becomes partially opaque as its opacity reduces.\n• : Enlarges the card on hover, making it appear to \"pop\" out\n• class: Handles the changes that occur on the background image when hovered. The image properties that change include (docs), (docs), and (docs) Let’s take a look at some icon hover effects that will be sure to make your website stand out.\n\nHover.css is a collection of CSS-powered hover effects that you can apply to images, links, SVGs, buttons, and more.
