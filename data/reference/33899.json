        "document": "Dealing with duplicates is a regular task for people working with data in Excel.\n\nWhile there is already an in-built Remove Duplicate functionality in Excel, you can also do the same using VBA.\n\nThis could be useful if you’re already working with VBA and want to remove duplicates using your code or automate the process.\n\nIn this article, I will explain how to remove duplicate values using VBA and then cover some examples of VBA codes you can use in various scenarios.\n\nLet’s first understand the Range.RemoveDuplicates method, which allows us to remove duplicates in VBA.\n\nBelow is the syntax of Range.RemoveDuplicates method:\n• “YourRange” is the range you’re working with\n• Columns:=Array(1,2) specifies which columns to check for duplicates (in this case, columns 1 and 2). This is a mandatory argument, and RemoveDuplicates won’t work if you don’t provide this.\n• Header:=xlYes indicates whether the first row contains headers. This is an optional argument, and if you don’t provide it, Excel will consider that your dataset doesn’t have a header.\n\nThe RemoveDuplicates method compares rows within the selected range.\n\nIf a row has the same values as another row in the specified columns, Excel will consider it a duplicate and remove it. The first occurrence of a unique combination is kept, while subsequent duplicates are deleted.\n\nNow, let’s look at some examples of how to use VBA to remove duplicate values in Excel in various scenarios.\n\nBelow, I have a dataset where I have names in column A, and I want to remove any duplicate occurrence of the name and only keep the unique ones.\n\nHere is the VBA code that would do this:\n\nThe above VBA code removes duplicate values from the range A1:A11 in the worksheet named “Sheet1”.\n\nThe RemoveDuplicates method is used on the range, specifying Columns:=1 to indicate that the operation should consider the first column within the specified range.\n\nThe Header:=xlYes argument indicates that the first row in the range (A1) is treated as a header row and not part of the data to be de-duplicated.\n\nIn the above example, I specified the range From which I wanted to remove the duplicate values. You can use the VBA code below to do the same from an already selected range of cells.\n\nBelow, I have a data set where I have names in column, their state in column B, and their city in column C, and I want to remove any duplicate instance of the name.\n\nThis means that I want to remove any record where the name repeats, irrespective of whether the state and city names are the same or not.\n\nThe VBA code below would do this:\n\nThe above code considers the entire range A1:C11 but only uses column 1 to check for duplicates.\n\nSo when it encounters a repeat instance of a name, that entire record is deleted.\n\nBelow, I have a data set where I have names in column, their state in column B, and their city in column C, and I want to remove any duplicate instances where the name and the state name are the same.\n\nThe VBA code below would do this:\n\nThe above code considers the entire range A1:C11 and then checks columns 1 and 2 to assess the duplicate records.\n\nWhen it encounters the same instance of the name and state, it considers that record as duplicate and removes it (irrespective of what the city name is)\n\nIf you want to remove the entire duplicate row, you can do that by specifying all the column numbers in the VBA code.\n\nBelow is a data set from which I want to remove all the duplicate rows (where a duplicate row would be where all the values in the row are the same as that of some other row).\n\nThe VBA code below would do this:\n\nSince there are three columns in my data set, I have used Columns:=Array(1,2,3). You can adjust this parameter accordingly if your data has more columns.\n\nVBA can be useful when you want to remove duplicates across multiple sheets in one go.\n\nNow, there can be two situations:\n• Your data set is in the same range in all the sheets, and you want to remove duplicates from it.\n• All the sheets have data sets of different sizes, and you need to use VBA first to determine the size and then remove the duplicate records from it.\n\nRemove Duplicates From the Same Range Across Multiple Sheets\n\nLet’s say you have a workbook with multiple worksheets, and all these worksheets have data in the same range (say A1:D40)\n\nBelow is the VBA code that would remove duplicates from multiple sheets in this scenario:\n\nThe above code uses a For Next loop to go through each sheet and then uses the RemoveDuplicates method to remove duplicate records from the specified range (which is A1:D40).\n\nThis was a pretty straightforward VBA code since we had to remove duplicates from the same range in each worksheet.\n\nHowever, in most practical scenarios, your range is likely to be of varying length. So, let’s say how to remove duplicates from each sheet where the ranges are of different sizes.\n\nBelow is the VBA code that would go through each worksheet in the given workbook, determine the range size, and then remove duplicates from it.\n\nThe above VBA code removes duplicate rows from all worksheets in a workbook based on the entire range of used columns.\n\nIt loops through each worksheet, then identifies the last row and column containing data, and then checks if there is a valid range (more than one row and at least one column).\n\nThe subroutine then dynamically creates an array (columnsArray) based on the number of columns and uses this array to specify the columns for the RemoveDuplicates method.\n\nThis method is applied to the entire Used range of each worksheet, considering all the columns for duplicate identification.\n\nThe above VBA macro removes duplicate rows from a specified table named “MyTable” in a worksheet named “Table“.\n\nIt uses a predefined array (columnsArray) containing column indexes (in this case, columns 1 and 2) to identify duplicates.\n\nThe RemoveDuplicates method is applied to the entire range of the table, considering the specified columns for duplicate detection.\n\nThe Header:=xlYes parameter indicates that the table has headers, which are excluded from the duplicate check.\n\nIf you’re encountering issues with the RemoveDuplicates method in VBA for Excel, there could be several reasons why it’s not working as expected.\n\nHere are some potential causes:\n\nEnsure that the range you’ve selected for the RemoveDuplicates method is correct. If the range is not properly defined, it may not include all the columns you intend to duplicate.\n\nWhen specifying columns in the RemoveDuplicates method, ensure you are using the correct column indexes. Remember, column indexing starts from 1 and not 0.\n\nSometimes, data that looks identical may have different data types (e.g., text vs. numeric). Ensure that the data types are consistent across each column.\n\nIf there are hidden rows or columns, they might be causing unexpected results. Make sure to account for or unhide them before running the duplicate removal.\n\nCheck for leading or trailing spaces in your data. These can cause entries that look identical to be treated as different. You might want to use the Trim function to remove extra spaces.\n\nThe RemoveDuplicates method is not case-sensitive. Therefore, entries with different cases (e.g., “Excel” vs. “excel”) will be considered duplicates.\n\nIf your range includes merged cells, it might cause the RemoveDuplicates method to behave unexpectedly. Ensure that cells are not merged in the range you are working with.\n\nDouble-check the syntax and parameters of the RemoveDuplicates method. Incorrect parameters can lead to unexpected results.\n\nSometimes, high macro security settings can prevent VBA scripts from running correctly. Check your macro security settings to ensure they’re not too restrictive.\n\nOther Excel articles you may also like:\n• What is VBA in Excel?\n• How to Delete Entire Row in Excel Using VBA\n• How to Combine Duplicate Rows and Sum the Values in Excel"

        "document": "How to automate Microsoft Excel from Visual Basic\n\nThis article demonstrates how to create and manipulate Excel by using Automation from Visual Basic.\n\nThere are two ways to control an Automation server: by using either late binding or early binding. With late binding, methods are not bound until run-time and the Automation server is declared as Object. With early binding, your application knows at design-time the exact type of object it will be communicating with, and can declare its objects as a specific type. This sample uses early binding, which is considered better in most cases because it affords greater performance and better type safety.\n\nTo early bind to an Automation server, you need to set a reference to that server's type library. In Visual Basic, this is done through the References dialog box found under the Project | References menu. For this sample, you will need to add a reference to the type library for Excel before you can run the code. See the steps below on how to add the reference.\n• None Start Visual Basic and create a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.\n• None ClickProject and then click References. The Referencesdialog box appears. Scroll down the list until you find Microsoft Excel object library, and then select the item to add a reference to Excel. If the correct object library for your version of Excel does not appear in the list, make sure that you have your version of Excel properly installed.\n• If you are automating Microsoft Office Excel 2007, the type library appears as Microsoft Excel 12.0 Object Library in the Referenceslist.\n• If you are automating Microsoft Office Excel 2003, the type library appears as Microsoft Excel 11.0 Object Library in the Referenceslist.\n• If you are automating Microsoft Excel 2002, the type library appears as Microsoft Excel 10.0 Object Library in the References list\n• If you are automating Microsoft Excel 2000, the type library appears as Microsoft Excel 9.0 Object Library in the References list.\n• If you are automating Microsoft Excel 97, the type library appears as Microsoft Excel 8.0 Object Library in the References list\n• None Click OK to close the References dialog box.\n• None In the code window for Form1, insert the following code: Option Explicit Private Sub Command1_Click() Dim oXL As Excel.Application Dim oWB As Excel.Workbook Dim oSheet As Excel.Worksheet Dim oRng As Excel.Range 'On Error GoTo Err_Handler ' Start Excel and get Application object.
