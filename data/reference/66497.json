        "document": "3,4,5,6,7,8,9,23, Under normal conditions, objects will radiate electromagnetic waves of different frequencies, which is called thermal radiation. It is difficult for people to see thermal radiation information with the naked eye [ 1 ]. It is necessary to use different sensors [ 2 10 ] to process the infrared image to obtain its thermal radiation information, which has good target detection ability [ 11 ]. Infrared images can avoid the influence of the external environment, such as sunlight, smoke, and other conditions [ 1 12 ]. However, infrared images have low contrast, complex background, and poor feature performance. Visible images are consistent with the human eye’s visual characteristics and contain many edge features and detailed information [ 13 ]. The use of visible light sensors to obtain image spectral information is richer, scene details and textures are clear, and spatial resolution is high. However, due to the external environment’s influence, such as night environment, camouflage, smoke hidden objects, background clutter, etc., the target may not be easily observed in the visible image. Therefore, infrared and visible light fusion technology combines the two’s advantages and retains more infrared and visible feature information in the fusion result [ 14 ]. Due to the universality and complementarity of infrared images and visible images, the fusion technology of infrared and visible images has been applied to more fields and plays an increasingly important role in computer vision. Nowadays, the fusion method of infrared and visible images have been widely used in target detection [ 15 ], target recognition [ 16 ], image enhancement [ 17 ], remote sensing detection [ 18 ], agricultural automation [ 19 20 ], medical imaging [ 21 ], industrial applications [ 22 24 ]. According to different image fusion processing domains, image fusion can be roughly divided into two categories: the spatial and transform domains. The focus of the fusion method is to extract relevant information from the source image and merge it [ 25 ]. Current fusion algorithms can be divided into seven categories, namely, multi-scale transform [ 26 ], sparse representation [ 27 ], neural network [ 28 ], subspace [ 29 ], saliency [ 30 ], hybrid models [ 31 ], and deep learning [ 32 ]. Each type of fusion method involves three key challenges, i.e., image transform, activity-level measurement, and fusion rule designing [ 33 ]. Image transformation includes different multiscale decomposition, various sparse representation methods, non-downsampling methods, and a combination of different transformations. The goal of activity level measurement is to obtain quantitative information to assign weights from different sources [ 12 ]. The fusion rules include the big rule and the weighted average rule, the essence of which plays the role of weight distribution [ 32 ]. With the rapid development of fusion algorithms in theory and application, selecting an appropriate feature extraction strategy is the key to image fusion. It is still challenging to design a suitable convolutional neural network and adjust the parameters based on deep learning image fusion. Especially in recent years, after generating a confrontation network for image fusion, although it brings a clearer fusion effect, it also needs to consider the inevitable gradient disappearance and gradient explosion of the generation confrontation training. In the field of image fusion, a variety of different infrared and visible image fusion methods have been proposed in recent years. However, there are still some challenges in different infrared and visible image fusion applications. The commonly seen fusion method is to select the same salient features of the source image and integrate them into the fusion image to contain more detailed information. However, the infrared heat radiation information is mainly characterized by pixel intensity, while edges and gradients characterize the visible image’s texture detail information. According to the different imaging characteristics of the source image, the selection of traditional manually designed fusion rules to represent the fused image, in the same way, will lead to the lack of diversity of extracted features, which may bring artifacts to the fused image. Moreover, for multi-source image fusion, manual fusion rules will make the method more and more complex. In view of the above problems, the image fusion method based on deep learning can assign weights to the model through an adaptive mechanism [ 34 ]. Compared with the design rules of traditional methods, this method greatly reduces the calculation cost, which is crucial in many fusion rules. Therefore, this research aims to conduct a detailed review of the existing deep learning-based infrared and visible image fusion algorithms and discuss their future development trends and challenges. Second, this article also introduces the theoretical knowledge of infrared and visible image fusion and the corresponding fusion evaluation index. This survey also makes a qualitative and quantitative comparison of some related articles’ experiments to provide a reliable basis for this research. Finally, we summarized the fusion methods in recent years and analyzed future work trends. The structure of this survey is schematically illustrated in Figure 1 Section 2 discusses the image fusion method based on deep learning. Section 3 provides an overview of the metrics used to measure fusion quality. In Section 4 , we extensively experiment to compare the typical algorithms in each category and provide an objective performance. Section 5 discusses the future development trends and problems of infrared and visible image fusion. In Section 6 , we have summarized the whole article.\n\n2. Fusion Methods of Infrared and Visible Images Based on Deep Learning In this section, we comprehensively review the infrared and visible image fusion methods based on deep learning. Increasing new methods of using deep learning for infrared and visible image fusion have been produced in recent years. These state-of-the-art methods are widely used in many applications, like image preprocessing, target recognition, and image classification. The traditional fusion framework can be roughly summarized in Figure 2 . The two essential factors of these algorithms are feature extraction and feature fusion. Their main theoretical methods can be divided into multiscale transformation, sparse representation, subspace analysis, and hybrid methods. However, these artificially designed extraction methods make the image fusion problem more complicated due to their limitations. In order to overcome the limitations of traditional fusion methods, deep learning methods are introduced for feature extraction. In recent years, with the development of deep learning, several fusion methods based on convolutional neural network (CNN), generative adversarial networks (GAN), Siamese network, and autoencoder have appeared in the field of image fusion. The main fusion methods involved in this section are listed in Table 1 by category. Image fusion results based on deep learning have good performance, but many methods also have apparent challenges. Therefore, we will introduce the details of each method in detail. In computer vision, convolutional layers play an important role in feature extraction and usually provide more information than traditional manual feature extraction methods [ 55 56 ]. The critical problem of image fusion is how to extract salient features from the source images and combine them to generate the fused image. However, CNN has three main challenges when applied to image fusion. First, training a good network requires much labeled data. However, the image fusion architecture based on the convolutional neural network is too simple, and the convolutional calculation layer in the network framework is less, and the features extracted from the image are insufficient, resulting in poor fusion performance. Second, the artificially designed image fusion rules are challenging to realize the end-to-end model network, and some errors will be mixed in the feature reconstruction process, which will affect the feature reconstruction of the image. Finally, the efficient information of the last layer is ignored in the traditional convolutional neural network algorithm, so that the model features cannot be fully retained. With the deepening of the network, the feature loss will become severe, resulting in a worsening of the final fusion effect. In [ 57 ], Liu et al. proposed a fusion method based on convolutional sparse representation (CSR). In their method, the authors use CSR to extract multilayer features and then use them to generate fusion images. In [ 58 ], they also proposed a fusion method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). They use image patches containing different feature inputs to train the network and obtain a decision graph. Finally, the fusion image is obtained by using the decision graph and the source image. Li et al. [ 35 ] proposed a simple and effective infrared and visible image fusion method based on a deep learning framework. The article divides the source image information into two parts, the former contains low-frequency information, and the latter contains texture information. The model is based on the multilayer fusion strategy of the VGG-19 network [ 59 ] through which the deep features of the detailed content can be obtained. In other multiple exposure fusion (MEF) algorithms, they rely on artificially searched features to fuse images. When the input conditions change, the parameters will follow the change, so the robustness of the algorithm cannot be guaranteed, and processing multiple exposure images will consume a lot. The learning ability of CNN is affected mainly by some loss functions. Prabhakar et al. [ 36 ], the proposed method does not need parameter adjustment when the input changes. The fusion network consists of three parts: the encoder, the fusion layer, and the decoder. To combine encoder networks employing encoders. From the perspective of the CNN method, by optimizing the parameters of the loss function learning model, the results can be predicted as accurately as possible. In [ 37 ], Ma et al. proposed an infrared and visible image based on the minimization of the total variation (TV) by limiting the fusion image to have similar pixel intensity to the infrared image and similar gradient to the visible image. In [ 38 ], Li et al. proposed a fusion framework based on deep features and zero-phase component analysis. First, the residual network is used to extract the depth features of the source image, and then the ZCA-zero-phase component analysis [ 60 ] and L1-norm are used for normalization to obtain the initial weight map. Finally, the weighted average strategy is used to reconstruct the fused image. Xu et al. [ 39 ], a new unsupervised and unified densely connected network is proposed. The densely connected network (DenseNet) [ 61 ] is trained to generate a fused image adjusted on the source image in the proposed method. In addition, we obtain a single model applicable to multiple fusion tasks by applying elastic weight consolidation to avoid forgetting what has been learned from previous tasks when training multiple tasks sequentially, rather than train individual models for every fusion task or jointly train tasks roughly. The weight of the two source images is obtained through the weight block, and different feature information is retained. The model generates high-quality fusion results in processing multi-exposure and multi-focus image fusion. In [ 40 ], Zhang et al. proposed an end-to-end model divided into three modules: feature extraction module, feature fusion module, and feature reconstruction module. Two convolutional layers are used to extract image features. Appropriate fusion rules are adopted for the convolutional features of multiple input images. Finally, the fused features are reconstructed by two convolutional layers to form a fused image. In [ 41 ], Xu et al. believe that an unsupervised end-to-end fusion network can solve different fusion problems, including multimode, multi-exposure, and multi-focus. The model can automatically estimate the importance of the corresponding source image features and provide adaptive information preservation because the model has an adaptive ability to retain the similarity between the fusion result and the source image. It dramatically reduces the difficulty of applying deep learning to image fusion-the universality of the model and the adaptive ability of training weights. Solve the catastrophic forgetting problem and computational complexity. In [ 42 ], Chen et al. used deep learning methods to fuse visible information and thermal radiation information in multispectral images. This method uses the multilayer fusion (MLF) area network in the image fusion stage. In this way, pedestrians can be detected at different ratios under unfavorable lighting (such as shadows, overexposure, or night) conditions. To be able to handle targets of various sizes, prevent the omission of some obscure pedestrian information. In the region extraction stage, MLF-CNN designed a multiscale region proposal network (RPN) [ 62 ] to fuse infrared and visible light information and use summation fusion to fuse two convolutional layers. In [ 43 ], to solve the lack of label dataset, Hou et al. used a mixed loss function. The thermal infrared image and the visible image were adaptively merged by redesigning the loss function, and noise interference was suppressed. This method can retain salient features and texture details with no apparent artifacts and have high computational efficiency. We make an overview list of some of the image fusion based on CNN in Table 2 Part of the difficulty of image fusion is that infrared images and visible images have different imaging methods. In order to make the fusion image retain the relatively complete information of the two source images at the same time, a pyramid framework is used to extract feature information from the infrared image and the visible image, respectively. 36,37,38, Liu et al. [ 58 ] recently proposed a Siamese convolutional network, especially image fusion. The network input is two source images, while the output is a weight map for the final decision. Many high-quality natural images are applied to generate the training dataset via Gaussian blurring and random sampling. The main characteristic of this approach is activity level measurement, and weight assignments are simultaneously achieved with the network. In particular, the convolutional layers and fully-connected layers could be viewed as the activity level measurement and weight assignment parts in image fusion, respectively. Again in [ 44 ], Liu et al. proposed a convolutional neural network-based infrared and visible image fusion method. This method uses the Siamese network to obtain the network weight map. The weight map combines the pixel activity information of the two source images. The model has mainly divided into four steps: the infrared image and the visible image are passed into the convolutional neural network to generate weights; the Gaussian pyramid is used to decompose the weight of the source image, and the two source images are decomposed by the Laplacian pyramid respectively. The information obtained by the decomposition of each pyramid is fused with coefficients in a weighted average manner. Figure 3 clearly explains the working principle of the Siamese network in the fusion process. In [ 45 ], Zhang et al. believe that CNN has a powerful feature representation ability and can produce good tracking performance. Still, the training and updating of the CNN model are time-consuming. Therefore, in this paper, the Siamese network is used for pixel-level fusion to reduce time consumption. First, the infrared and visible images are fused and then put into the Siamese network for feature tracking. In [ 46 ], Zhang et al. used a fully convolutional Siamese network fusion tracking method. SIamFT uses a Siamese network, a visible light network, an infrared network. They are used to process visible and infrared images, respectively. The backbone uses the SiamFC network, the visible light part of the network weight sharing, and the infrared part of the network weight sharing. The operating speed is about [ 35 58 ] FPS so that it can meet real-time requirements. In [ 47 ], Piao et al. designed an adaptive learning model based on the Siamese network, which automatically generates the corresponding weight map through the saliency of each pixel in the source image to reduce the number of traditional fusion rules. The parameter redundancy problem. This paper uses a three-level wavelet transform to decompose the source image into a low-frequency weight map and a high-frequency weight map. The scaled weight map is used to reconstruct the wavelet image to obtain the corresponding fused image. This result is more consistent with the human visual perception system. There are fewer undesirable artifacts. We make an overview list of some image fusion based on the Siamese network in Table 3 The existing deep learning-based image fusion technology usually relies on the CNN model, but in this case, the ground truth needs to be provided for the model. However, in the fusion of infrared and visible images, it is unrealistic to define fusion image standards. Therefore, without considering the ground truth, a deep model is learned to determine the degree of blurring of each patch in the source image, and then the weight is calculated. Map accordingly to generate the final fusion image [ 44 ]. Using a generative countermeasure network to fuse infrared and visible images can be free from the above problems. In [ 33 ], Ma et al. proposed an image fusion method based on a generative confrontation network, where the generator is mainly for the fusion of infrared images and visible images, and the purpose of the discriminator is to make the fused image have more details in the visible image, which makes the fused image. The infrared heat radiation information and visible texture information can be kept in the fusion image simultaneously. Figure 4 shows the image fusion framework based on GAN. For fusion GAN, the source image’s vital information cannot be retained at the same time during the image fusion process, and too much calculation space is occupied during the convolution process. In [ 48 ], learning group convolution is used to improve the efficiency of the model and save computing resources. In this way, a better tradeoff can be made between model accuracy and speed. Moreover, the remaining dense blocks are used as the fundamental network construction unit. The inactive perceptual characteristics are used as the input content loss characteristics, which achieves deep network supervision. In [ 49 ], Ma et al. make the fusion image similar to the infrared image by constrained sampling to avoid blurring radiation information or loss of visible texture details. The dual discriminator does not need ground truth fusion images for pre-training, which can fuse images of different resolutions without causing thermal radiation information blur or visible texture detail loss. Considering the two challenges of CNN, relying only on adversarial training will result in the loss of detailed information. Therefore, a minimax game is established between the generator and the discriminator in [ 50 ]. The loss of the model becomes the loss of detail, the loss of the target edge, and confrontation loss. In [ 51 ], Xu et al., based on local binary pattern (LBP) [ 63 ], intuitively reflected the edge information of the image by comparing the values between the central pixel and the surrounding eight pixels to generate a fusion image with richer boundary information. The discriminator encodes and decodes the fused image and each source image, respectively, and measures the difference between the distributions after decoding. In [ 52 ], Li et al. used the pre-fused image as the label strategy so that the generator takes the pre-fused image as the benchmark in the generation process so that the image fused by the generator can effectively and permanently retain the rich texture in the visible image and the thermal radiation information in the infrared image. We make an overview list of some of the image fusion based on GAN in Table 4 In the paper [ 36 ], Prabhakaret et al. studied the fusion problem based on CNN. They proposed a simple CNN-based architecture, including two encoding network layers and three decoding network layers. Although this method has good performance, there are still two main shortcomings: (1) The network architecture is too simple, and it may not be able to extract the salient features of the source image correctly; (2) These methods only use the last layer of the encoding network to calculate; as a result, the useful information obtained by the middle layer will be lost. This phenomenon will become sparser when the network is deeper. In the traditional CNN network, as the depth increases, the fusion ability of the model is degraded [ 30 ]. For this problem, Heet et al. [ 64 ] introduced a deep residual learning framework to improve the layers’ information flow further. Huang et al. [ 61 ] proposed new architecture with dense blocks in which each layer can be directly connected to any subsequent layer. The main advantages of the dense block architecture: (1) the architecture can retain as much information as possible; (2) the model can improve the information flow and gradient through the network, and the network is easy to train; (3) this dense connection method has a regularization effect, which can reduce overfitting caused by too many parameters [ 61 ]. In [ 53 ], Li et al. combine the encoding network with the convolutional layer, fusion layer, and dense block, and the output of each layer is connected. The figure shows the working principle of the Autoencoder model in the fusion image. The model first obtains the feature map through CNN and dense block and then fuses the feature through the fusion strategy. After the fusion layer, the feature map is integrated into a feature map containing the significant features of the source image. Finally, the fused image is reconstructed by a decoder. The fusion mechanism of the autoencoder is shown in Figure 5 . In [ 49 ], Ma et al. considering the existing methods to solve the difference between output and target by designing loss function. These indicators will introduce new problems. It is necessary to design an adaptive loss function to avoid the ambiguity of the results. Most human-designed fusion rules lead to the extraction of the same features for different types of source images, making this method unsuitable for multi-source image fusion. In this paper, a double discriminator is used to pre-train the fused images. An Autoencoder is used to fuse the images with different resolutions to retain the maximum or approximately the maximum amount of information in the source images. In [ 54 ], Sun et al. used the RGB-thermal fusion network (RTFNet). RTFNet consists of three modules: RGB encoder and infrared encoder for extracting features from RGB images and Thermal images, respectively, and decoder to restore the resolution of feature images. Where the encoder and decoder are designed regionally symmetric, RTFNet is used for feature extraction, where the new encoder can restore the resolution of the approximate feature map. As this method is mainly used for scene segmentation, the edge of scene segmentation is not sharp.\n\nInfrared and visible light image fusion has attracted widespread attention in the field of image fusion. Due to the advancement of image fusion technology, it is necessary to evaluate several related image fusion methods that have been proposed. However, different fusion methods have different characteristics, and there are significant differences in the actual application process. Many researchers use fusion evaluation indicators to evaluate fused infrared and visible images [ 65 ]. The existing integration indicators are roughly divided into subjective evaluation and objective evaluation [ 66 ]. Objective evaluation can avoid the above problems. Researchers can use different point-specific evaluation indicators for quantitative reference and make accurate comparisons of image fusion. The subjective evaluation can be further divided into the absolute evaluation and relative evaluation, which is implemented by a widely recognized five-level quality scale and obstacle scale [ 67 ]. The most direct form of subjective evaluation is human eye observation. Humans compare different fusion methods by observing image details, contrast, image integrity, and degree of distortion. Subjective evaluators can use the evaluation criteria to score qualitatively on the fused image directly. Still, everyone has different evaluation criteria for the same image, which is easily affected by personal preference, environment, and other factors, leading to incorrect responses to the fused image. This method’s quality is poor, and the timeliness is low, which is not conducive to a multidimensional evaluation of fusion images. It is necessary to combine objective evaluation indicators to evaluate the fusion results reasonably. Objective evaluation can avoid problems existing in subjective evaluation. Researchers can make quantitative reference for evaluation indicators with different emphases and make an accurate comparison for image fusion. There are many kinds of objective fusion indicators, which are defined according to some computable mathematical formulas. The objective evaluation is to establish a corresponding mathematical model by simulating the human visual perception system and compare the performance of each fusion method through statistical data. Objective image quality measurement includes the use of reference standard images and non-reference standard images. Common objective evaluation indicators have been listed in Table 5 . In this section, we mainly introduce the relevant evaluation indicators in the table in detail. according to Shannon’s method of using information entropy as the quantification of information content [ represents the number of gray levels of the image, represents the proportion of pixels with a gray value of 1 in the total pixels. The higher the , the richer the information and the better the quality of the fused image. EN is a form of statistical features that can reflect the average amount of information in an image. Its mathematical definition is as follows:according to Shannon’s method of using information entropy as the quantification of information content [ 110 ], whererepresents the number of gray levels of the image,represents the proportion of pixels with a gray value of 1 in the total pixels.

The difference in standard deviation can reflect the difference in image contrast, which is similar to the high sensitivity of the human visual system to high-contrast areas. A high-contrast fusion image will produce a larger , which means that the fusion image has a clear contrast [ SD is an objective evaluation index to measure the richness of image information. Standard deviation is used to measure the change of pixel intensity in the fused image. Its mathematical definition is as follows:whererepresents the mean value and can also be used to evaluate fusion images. The difference in standard deviation can reflect the difference in image contrast, which is similar to the high sensitivity of the human visual system to high-contrast areas. A high-contrast fusion image will produce a larger, which means that the fusion image has a clear contrast [ 75 ]. where and are the reference image and fused image, respectively, , , 2, 2, and represent the mean value and variance and covariance of images and , respectively, and , , and are small normal numbers to avoid having a denominator of zero. When , will become a general fusion index [ , , are used to adjust the proportions. The value of will be between [−1, 1], and the larger the value, the more similar the fused image and the source image in terms of brightness, contrast, and structure. SSIM models image loss and distortion [ 82 ], compares and measures the similarity in three aspects of image brightness, contrast, and structure, and finally combines the three components to produce an overall similarity measure. According to the change of image structure information, the image’s distortion in three aspects is considered an objective evaluation. The mathematical definition is as follows:whereandare the reference image and fused image, respectively,, andrepresent the mean value and variance and covariance of imagesand, respectively, and, andare small normal numbers to avoid having a denominator of zero.

Generally speaking, the larger the average gradient value, the richer the information in the fusion image and the better the fusion effect. calculates the error between the fused image and the source image to measure the difference between the two. Its mathematical definition is: where and represent the differences between fused images and infrared and visible images, respectively.

VIFF is only used in image fusion and is developed based on visual information fidelity (VIF) [ 111 ]. Yu et al. [ 108 ] used the VIF model to extract the visual information of the source image. They obtained the effective fusion of visual information after further processing to remove the distortion information. Finally, after integrating all the visual information, the VIFF specially used for fusion evaluation is obtained. According to [ 108 ], the calculation process of VIFF is summarized into four parts. First, filter the source image and the fusion image and divide them into different blocks. Second, evaluate whether each block has distorted visual information. Third, calculate the fidelity of the visual information of each block. Fourth, the overall index based on VIF is calculated. and are indicators inspired by human perception and used to measure the visual performance of fused images. Running time is an essential indicator for evaluating the performance of an algorithm. The time complexity of an image fusion algorithm is used to evaluate the computational efficiency of the model.\n\nThe feature information of infrared and visible images has many complementary features so that the fusion algorithm can be embedded in many applications and improve the original method [ 7 ]. The fusion technology of infrared and visible images has been applied to target detection [ 8 ], tracking [ 107 ], surveillance [ 18 ], remote sensing [ 102 ], and medical image processing [ 82 ]. At present, there are several existing visible and infrared image fusion data sets, including OSU color thermal database [ 112 ], TNO image fusion dataset [ 113 ], INO video analytics dataset, VLIRVDIF [ 114 ], VIFB [ 115 ], and RGB-NIR Scene dataset [ 116 ]. Table 6 summarizes the preliminary information about these datasets. In fact, except for OSU, there are not many image pairs in TNO and VLIRVDIF. However, the lack of a code library, evaluation metrics, and the results of these datasets make it difficult to evaluate the latest technologies against them. This section first introduces the fusion method in the treatment of complex color images of the space application. Second, we aimed at several specific infrared and visible image fusion methods that were evaluated and had a comprehensive understanding of their practical application characteristics and performance. C color space and only fuse the Y channel. The Y channel refers to the luminance component, C refers to the blue chrominance component, and C refers to the red chrominance component. The human eye is more sensitive to the Y component of the image, so after subsampling the chrominance component C or C to reduce the chrominance component, the naked eye will not perceive a significant change in image quality [ , and C channels through YC C and only fused the MRI image with the Y channel. Then the fused image is fused with C and C color components and inversely transformed to RGB space to obtain the final fusion result. Medical image fusion aims to improve image quality by retaining specific features, increasing the applicability of the image in clinical diagnosis, and evaluating medical problems [ 82 ]. With the rapid development of sensors and image fusion, medical image fusion has played a vital role in various clinical applications, including medical diagnosis [ 104 ], surgical navigation, and treatment planning. It is an essential tool for doctors to diagnose diseases accurately [ 103 ]. In medical imaging, X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography are typical structural systems. MRI images are similar to visible images. It is excellent in capturing the details of the soft tissue structure of the brain, heart, and lungs with high-resolution. Positron emission tomography (PET) images are similar to infrared images in that they are obtained through nuclear medicine imaging and can provide functional and metabolic information, such as blood flow activity. However, PET and single-photon emission computed tomography are usually rich in color, but low-resolution imaging limits their clinical applications due to limited resolution. Therefore, by fusing these two types of medical images, the result will contain the spatial and spectral characteristics of the source image [ 49 ]. As shown in Figure 6 a, PET images are usually regarded as color images, and color images represent useful information. To retain useful information, the color of the fusion image should be as similar to the color of the PET image as possible. To preserve the image color in the image fusion, we adopt the PET image to the YCcolor space and only fuse the Y channel. The Y channel refers to the luminance component, Crefers to the blue chrominance component, and Crefers to the red chrominance component. The human eye is more sensitive to the Y component of the image, so after subsampling the chrominance component Cor Cto reduce the chrominance component, the naked eye will not perceive a significant change in image quality [ 117 ]. Therefore, in the experiment process, as shown in Figure 7 , we first converted the PET image into Y, C, and Cchannels through YCand only fused the MRI image with the Y channel. Then the fused image is fused with Cand Ccolor components and inversely transformed to RGB space to obtain the final fusion result. AB/F, to evaluate the fusion results quantitatively. The experiments are conducted with 3.7 GHz Intel 10,900×, GPU RTX 2080TI, and 11 GB memory. This section has commonly used infrared and visible images for qualitative evaluation experiments for several typical fusion methods, as shown in Figure 8 . To evaluate different image fusion methods’ performance, we used the seven most commonly used evaluation indicators, namely SF, EN, CC, COSIN, SD, SSIM, MI, and Qto evaluate the fusion results quantitatively. The experiments are conducted with 3.7 GHz Intel 10,900×, GPU RTX 2080TI, and 11 GB memory. It can be seen from the qualitative experimental results that the fusion results of the guided filtering based fusion method (GFF) method have a large area of artifacts, and the thermal radiation target is not prominent. However, the fusion images of dual-discriminator conditional generative adversarial network (DDcGAN), fully learnable group convolution (FLGC)-fusion GAN, and fusion GAN have more apparent texture details than other images, higher image contrast, and more prominent thermal radiation targets. The gradient transfer fusion (GTF) method has a good fusion effect on Bunker, Kaptein_1123, Kaptein_1654, and Lake images. However, when applied to the scene of Sandpath, it is easy to find that the thermal radiation targets in the image are not prominent. Therefore, from the perspective of qualitative analysis, most of the above methods need further optimization. We further use the above seven fusion indicators to conduct a quantitative comparison between ten pairs of infrared images and visible images in the TNO dataset, as shown in Table 7 . Quantitative experimental results show that each fusion algorithm has advantages and disadvantages, and different methods show different advantages in different aspects. With deep learning in infrared and visible image fusion, superior new technologies have been continuously emerging to achieve better fusion results. In general, the fusion effect of GTF, fusion GAN, FLGC-fusion GAN, and DDcGAN is better than other methods in terms of brightness, texture detail, and contrast. It can be seen from Table 7 that DDcGAN with FLGC—fusion GAN was generally, even on individual indexes of several fusion methods, is better than the last. However, through Table 8 , it is found that the operation efficiency of DDcGAN is lower than fusion GAN. Considering that the balance between computational complexity and fusion effect is essential for the fusion of infrared and visible images, infrared and visible image features will become a difficult and challenging problem. Most image fusion indicators can only reflect the quality of the fused image to a certain extent. Hence, it is necessary to study more effective fusion methods and evaluation indicators to conduct a comprehensive quality evaluation. We summarized the running time of the eight fusion methods used for qualitative evaluation, as shown in Table 8 . Although there are many new research methods in recent years, they are limited by a code library. Therefore, we evaluate some open-source fusion methods on the TNO dataset. For the experimental results of other fusion methods, please refer to related papers.\n\nThe application of DL-based techniques to visible and infrared image fusion has been progressing at a fast rate in recent years. However, due to the complexity of application scenarios and the pursuit of computational efficiency and fusion effect, different applications of IR and VI image fusion still need to be further improved, and there are also potential development directions. This paper reviews the latest developments in DL-based image fusion technology and summarizes the issues that should be improved in this field in the future. This review investigates infrared and visible image fusion methods based on DL in recent years. These methods are mainly divided into four categories: CNN-based methods, GAN-based methods, Siamese network-based methods, and Autoencoder methods. We briefly outline objective and subjective fusion indicators and use these evaluation indicators to test and evaluate several typical fusion methods. From the perspective of FLGC-fusion GAN, DDcGAN, and the latest technologies mentioned in this paper, DL has gradually developed and matured in the field of image fusion. However, in deep learning, which is widely used in the fusion of infrared and visible images, we still need to pay attention to the fusion effect and calculation choices. Furthermore, there will be more fusion technologies based on different methods, and deep learning methods will still be the popular trend in this application field."

        "document": "We propose a novel method to fuse true colour images with monochromatic non-visible range images that seeks to encode important structural information from monochromatic images efficiently but also preserve the natural appearance of the available true chromacity information. We utilise the β colour opponency channel of the lαβ colour as the domain to fuse information from the monochromatic input into the colour input by the way of robust grayscale fusion. This is followed by an effective gradient structure visualisation step that enhances the visibility of monochromatic information in the final colour fused image. Images fused using this method preserve their natural appearance and chromacity better than conventional methods while at the same time clearly encode structural information from the monochormatic input. This is demonstrated on a number of well-known true colour fusion examples and confirmed by the results of subjective trials on the data from several colour fusion scenarios. Introduction The goal of image fusion can be broadly defined as: the representation of visual information contained in a number of input images into a single fused image without distortion or loss of information. In practice, however, a representation of all available information from multiple inputs in a single image is almost impossible and fusion is generally a data reduction task. One of the sensors usually provides a true colour image that by definition has all of its data dimensions already populated by the spatial and chromatic information. Fusing such images with information from monochromatic inputs in a conventional manner can severely affect natural appearance of the fused image. This is a difficult problem and partly the reason why colour fusion received only a fraction of the attention than better behaved grayscale fusion even long after colour sensors became widespread. Fusion method Humans tend to see colours as contrasts between opponent colours and an improvement in visibility of structures from the monochrome can be achieved when they are used to encode a single HVS colour dimension consistently. The lαβ colour system effectively decorrelates the colour opponency and intensity channels and manipulating one causes no visible changes in the others. Colour fusion can be achieved by fusing one of the colour opponency channels with the monochrome image. We use the Laplacian pyramid fusion known to be one of the most robust monochrome fusion methods available. The Laplacian, also known as the DOLP (difference of low-pass) pyramid is a reversible multiresolution representation that expresses the image through a series of sub-band images of decreasing resolution, increasing scale, whose coefficients broadly express fine detail contrast at that location and scale. A simple fusion strategy creates a new fused pyramid by copying the largest absolute input coefficient at each location. The β channel of the lαβ space represents the red-green opponency and we base our fusion on encoding this channel of the colour input with the monochrome image. This causes warmer objects (lighter in IR) to appear redder in the fused image. The fusion proceeds in several steps. Initially we transform the colour input RGB image into the lαβ image. Monochrome fusion is then performed by decomposing the β image and the normalised monochrome into their Laplacian pyramid representations. We use the select max strategy to construct the fused pyramid but we only apply this to a small number of higher resolution pyramid sub-bands. Larger scale features in lower resolution sub-band images that constitute the natural context of the scene are sourced entirely from the colour image (β). This ensures that well defined smaller objects from the IR image are transferred robustly into the fused image as well as the broad scene context from the colour input. Reconstructing the fused pyramid produces the fused β image which is combined with the original l and α channels of the colour input to produce the fused RGB colour image. Edge Emphasis We encode only the β channel which has only a fraction of the overall colour signal power (most is in the intensity channel) so the contrast of the monochrome image structures is still relatively modest in the fused image. We can improve their visualisation using a relatively simple effect of gradient outline enhancement. Initially, we extract gradient information from the monochrome image using 3x3 Sobel edge operators. The responses to horizontal and vertical Sobel templates, sx and sy, are combined to evaluate gradient magnitude at each location. To enhance the structure visualisation, prior to fusion, to the monochrome input we add its gradient magnitude image. The enhanced monochrome image is well behaved as the used gradient filters are linear, and is used directly as the input into monochrome fusion. The gradient magnitude image effectively captures the primal sketch of the scene and encoding an opponency channel with this information improves the visualisation of the structural outline of the monochrome input in the colour fused image. Results and Conclusion A new “β fusion” colour image fusion method is presented that successfully both visualises important structure information from the monochrome input and preserves the natural appearance of the true colour input. Colour fusion is performed in the lαβ colour space known to decorrelate main colour opponencies seen by the human visual system. We chose the β channel representing the red-green opponency of the true colour image to encode structural information from the monochrome input by fusing them using modified Laplacian pyramid fusion. The visualisation of important structures from the monochrome input can be improved through a simple structure encoding step using its gradient information. The method is naturally extended to video fusion. The proposed fusion methods produce colour fused images with significantly better visualisation of important information from the monochrome input while almost entirely preserving the natural appearance of the true colour input. This was demonstrated on a number of well-known colour fusion examples and measured using subjective trials on the data from multiple surveillance scenarios."

        "document": "Have you ever struggled with poor quality images in your machine learning or computer vision projects? Images are the lifeblood of many Al systems today, but not all images are created equal. Before you can train a model or run an algorithm, you often need to do some preprocessing on your images to get the best results. Image preprocessing in Python is your new best friend.\n\nIn this guide, you’ll learn all the tips and tricks for preparing your images for analysis using Python. We’ll cover everything from resizing and cropping to reducing noise and normalizing. By the time you’re done, your images will be ready for their closeup. With the help of libraries like OpenCV, Pillow, and scikit-image, you’ll be enhancing images in no time. So get ready to roll up your sleeves — it’s time to dive into the complete guide to image preprocessing techniques in Python!\n\nWhat Is Image Preprocessing and Why Is It Important?\n\nImage preprocessing is the process of manipulating raw image data into a usable and meaningful format. It allows you to eliminate unwanted distortions and enhance specific qualities essential for computer vision applications. Preprocessing is a crucial first step to prepare your image data before feeding it into machine learning models.\n\nThere are several techniques used in image preprocessing:\n• Resizing: Resizing images to a uniform size is important for machine learning algorithms to function properly. We can use OpenCV’s resize() method to resize images.\n• Grayscaling: Converting color images to grayscale can simplify your image data and reduce computational needs for some algorithms. The cvtColor() method can be used to convert RGB to grayscale.\n• Noise reduction: Smoothing, blurring, and filtering techniques can be applied to remove unwanted noise from images. The GaussianBlur () and medianBlur () methods are commonly used for this.\n• Normalization: Normalization adjusts the intensity values of pixels to a desired range, often between 0 to 1. This can improve the performance of machine learning models. Normalize () from scikit-image can be used for this.\n• Binarization: Binarization converts grayscale images to black and white by thresholding. The threshold () method is used to binarize images in OpenCV.\n• Contrast enhancement: The contrast of images can be adjusted using histogram equalization. The equalizeHist () method enhances the contrast of images.\n\nWith the right combination of these techniques, you can significantly improve your image data and build better computer vision applications. Image preprocessing allows you to refine raw images into a format suitable for the problem you want to solve.\n\nTo get started with image processing in Python, you’ll need to load and convert your images into a format the libraries can work with. The two most popular options for this are OpenCV and Pillow.\n\nLoading images with OpenCV: OpenCV can load images in formats like PNG, JPG, TIFF, and BMP. You can load an image with:\n\nThis will load the image as a NumPy array. The image is in the BGR color space, so you may want to convert it to RGB.\n\nLoading images with Pillow: Pillow is a friendly PIL (Python Image Library) fork. It supports even more formats than OpenCV, including PSD, ICO, and WEBP. You can load an image with:\n\nThe image will be in RGB color space.\n\nConverting between color spaces: You may need to convert images between color spaces like RGB, BGR, HSV, and Grayscale. This can be done with OpenCV or Pillow. For example, to convert BGR to Grayscale in OpenCV, use:\n\nOr to convert RGB to HSV in Pillow:\n\nWith these foundational skills, you’ll be ready to move on to more advanced techniques like resizing, filtering, edge detection, and beyond. The possibilities are endless! What image processing project will you build?\n\nResizing and cropping your images is an important first step in image preprocessing.\n\nImages come in all shapes and sizes, but machine learning algorithms typically require a standard size. You’ll want to resize and crop your images to square dimensions, often 224x224 or 256x256 pixels.\n\nIn Python, you can use the OpenCY or Pillow library for resizing and cropping. With OpenCV, use the resize() function. For example:\n\nThis will resize the image to 224x224 pixels.\n\nTo crop an image to a square, you can calculate the center square crop size and use crop() in OpenCV with the center coordinates. For example:\n\nWith Pillow, you can use the Image. open () and resize() functions. For example:\n\nTo crop the image, use img. crop(). For example:\n\nResizing and cropping your images to a standard size is a crucial first step. It will allow your machine learning model to process the images efficiently and improve the accuracy of your results. Take the time to resize and crop your images carefully, and your model will thank you!\n\nWhen working with image data, it’s important to normalize the pixel values to have a consistent brightness and improve contrast. This makes the images more suitable for analysis and allows machine learning models to learn patterns independent of lighting conditions.\n\nRescaling Pixel Values: The most common normalization technique is rescaling the pixel values to range from 0 to 1. This is done by dividing all pixels by the maximum pixel value (typically 255 for RGB images). For example:\n\nThis will scale all pixels between 0 and 1, with 0 being black and 1 being white.\n\nHistogram Equalization: Another useful technique is histogram equalization. This spreads out pixel intensities over the whole range to improve contrast. It can be applied with OpenCV using:\n\nThis works well for images with low contrast where pixel values are concentrated in a narrow range.\n\nFor some algorithms, normalizing to have zero mean and unit variance is useful. This can be done by subtracting the mean and scaling to unit variance:\n\nThis will center the image around zero with a standard deviation of 1.\n\nThere are a few other more complex normalization techniques, but these three methods-rescaling to the 0–1 range, histogram equalization, and standardization — cover the basics and will prepare your image data for most machine learning applications. Be sure to apply the same normalization to both your training and testing data for the best results.\n\nOnce you have your images loaded in Python, it’s time to start enhancing them. Image filters are used to reduce noise, sharpen details, and overall improve the quality of your images before analysis. Here are some of the main filters you’ll want to know about:\n\nGaussian Blur:\n\nThe Gaussian blur filter reduces detail and noise in an image. It “blurs” the image by applying a Gaussian function to each pixel and its surrounding pixels. This can help smooth edges and details in preparation for edge detection or other processing techniques.\n\nMedian Blur:\n\nThe median blur filter is useful for removing salt and pepper noise from an image. It works by replacing each pixel with the median value of its neighboring pixels. This can help smooth out isolated noisy pixels while preserving edges.\n\nLaplacian Filter:\n\nThe Laplacian filter is used to detect edges in an image. It works by detecting areas of rapid intensity change. The output will be an image with edges highlighted, which can then be used for edge detection. This helps identify and extract features in an image.\n\nUnsharp Masking:\n\nUnsharp masking is a technique used to sharpen details and enhance edges in an image. It works by subtracting a blurred version of the image from the original image. This amplifies edges and details, making the image appear sharper. Unsharp masking can be used to sharpen details before feature extraction or object detection.\n\nBilateral Filter:\n\nThe bilateral filter smooths images while preserving edges. It does this by considering both the spatial closeness and color similarity of pixels. Pixels that are close together spatially and similar in color are smoothed together. Pixels that are distant or very different in color are not smoothed. This results in a smoothed image with sharp edges.\n\nThe bilateral filter can be useful for noise reduction before edge detection.\n\nBy applying these filters, you’ll have high-quality, enhanced images ready for in-depth analysis and computer vision tasks. Give them a try and see how they improve your image processing results!\n\nDetecting and removing backgrounds from images is an important preprocessing step for many computer vision tasks. Segmentation separates the foreground subject from the background, leaving you with a clean image containing just the subject.\n\nThere are a few common ways to perform image segmentation in Python using OpenCV and scikit-image:\n\nThresholding:\n\nThresholding converts a grayscale image into a binary image (black and white) by choosing a threshold value. Pixels darker than the threshold become black, and pixels lighter become white. This works well for images with high contrast and uniform lighting. You can use OpenCV’s threshold() method to apply thresholding.\n\nEdge Detection:\n\nEdge detection finds the edges of objects in an image. By connecting edges, you can isolate the foreground subject. The Canny edge detector is a popular algorithm implemented in scikit-image’s canny() method. Adjust the low_threshold and high_threshold parameters to detect edges.\n\nRegion Growing:\n\nRegion growing starts with a group of seed points and grows outward to detect contiguous regions in an image. You provide the seed points, and the algorithm examines neighboring pixels to determine if they should be added to the region. This continues until no more pixels can be added. The skimage. segmentation. region_growing () method implements this technique.\n\nWatershed:\n\nThe watershed algorithm treats an image like a topographic map, with high intensity pixels representing peaks and valleys representing borders between regions. It starts at the peaks and floods down, creating barriers when different regions meet. The skimage. segmentation. watershed() method performs watershed segmentation.\n\nBy experimenting with these techniques, you can isolate subjects from the background in your images. Segmentation is a key first step, allowing you to focus your computer vision models on the most important part of the image-the foreground subject.\n\nUsing Data Augmentation to Expand Your Dataset\n\nData augmentation is a technique used to artificially expand the size of your dataset by generating new images from existing ones. This helps reduce overfitting and improves the generalization of your model. Some common augmentation techniques for image data include:\n\nFlipping and rotating:\n\nSimply flipping (horizontally or vertically) or rotating (90, 180, 270 degrees) images can generate new data points. For example, if you have 1,000 images of cats, flipping and rotating them can give you 4,000 total images (1,000 original + 1,000 flipped horizontally + 1,000 flipped vertically + 1,000 rotated 90 degrees).\n\nCropping:\n\nCropping images to different sizes and ratios creates new images from the same original. This exposes your model to different framings and compositions of the same content. You can create random crops of varying size, or target more specific crop ratios like squares.\n\nColor manipulation:\n\nAdjusting brightness, contrast, hue, and saturation are easy ways to create new augmented images. For example, you can randomly adjust the brightness and contrast of images by up to 30% to generate new data points. Be careful not to distort the images too much, or you risk confusing your model.\n\nImage overlays:\n\nOverlaying transparent images, textures or noise onto existing images is another simple augmentation technique. Adding things like watermarks, logos, dirt/scratches or Gaussian noise can create realistic variations of your original data. Start with subtle overlays and see how your model responds.\n\nCombining techniques:\n\nFor the biggest increase in data, you can combine multiple augmentation techniques on the same images. For example, you can flip, rotate, crop and adjust the color of images, generating many new data points from a single original image. But be careful not to overaugment, or you risk distorting the images beyond recognition!\n\nUsing data augmentation, you can easily multiply the size of your image dataset by 4x, 10x or more, all without collecting any new images. This helps combat overfitting and improves model accuracy, all while keeping training time and cost the same.\n\nChoosing the Right Preprocessing Steps for Your Application\n\nChoosing the right preprocessing techniques for your image analysis project depends on your data and goals. Some common steps include:\n\nResizing:\n\nResizing images to a consistent size is important for machine learning algorithms to work properly. You’ll want all your images to be the same height and width, usually a small size like 28x28 or 64x64 pixels. The resize() method in OpenCV or Pillow libraries make this easy to do programmatically.\n\nColor conversion:\n\nConverting images to grayscale or black and white can simplify your analysis and reduce noise. The cvtColor() method in OpenCV converts images from RGB to grayscale. For black and white, use thresholding.\n\nNoise reduction:\n\nTechniques like Gaussian blurring, median blurring, and bilateral filtering can reduce noise and smooth images. OpenCV’s GaussianBlur(), medianBlur(), and bilateralFilter() methods apply these filters.\n\nNormalization\n\nNormalizing pixel values to a standard range like 0 to 1 or -1 to 1 helps algorithms work better. You can normalize images with the normalize() method in scikit-image.\n\nContrast enhancement:\n\nFor low contrast images, histogram equalization improves contrast. The equaliseHist() method in OpenCV performs this task.\n\nEdge detection:\n\nFinding the edges or contours in an image is useful for many computer vision tasks. The Canny edge detector in OpenCV’s Canny() method is a popular choice.\n\nThe key is choosing techniques that will prepare your images to suit your particular needs. Start with basic steps like resizing, then try different methods to improve quality and see which ones optimize your results. With some experimenting, you’ll find an ideal preprocessing workflow.\n\nNow that you have a good grasp of the various image preprocessing techniques in Python, you probably have a few lingering questions. Here are some of the most frequently asked questions about image preprocessing and their answers:\n\nWhat image formats does Python support?\n\nPython supports a wide range of image formats through libraries like OpenCV and Pillow.\n\nSome of the major formats include:\n• JPEG — Common lossy image format\n• PNG — Lossless image format good for images with transparency\n• TIFF — Lossless image format good for high color depth images\n• BMP — Uncompressed raster image format\n\nWhen should I resize an image?\n\nYou should resize an image when:\n• The image is too large to process efficiently. Reducing size can speed up processing.\n• The image needs to match the input size of a machine learning model.\n• The image needs to be displayed pn a screen or webpage at a specific. size.\n\nWhat are some common noise reduction techniques?\n\nSome popular noise reduction techniques include:\n• Gaussian blur — Uses a Gaussian filter to blur the image and reduce high frequency noise.\n• Median blur — Replaces each pixel with the median of neighboring pixels. Effective at removing salt and pepper noise.\n• Bilateral filter — Blurs images while preserving edges. It can remove noise while retaining sharp edges.\n\nWhat color spaces are supported in OpenCV and how do I convert between them?\n\nOpenCV supports RGB, HSV, LAB, and Grayscale color spaces. You can convert between color spaces using the cvtColor function. For example:\n\nConverting to different color spaces is useful for certain computer vision tasks like thresholding, edge detection, and object tracking.\n\nSo there you have it, a complete guide to getting your images ready for analysis in Python. With the power of OpenCV and other libraries, you now have all the tools you need to resize, enhance, filter, and transform your images. Go ahead and play around with the different techniques, tweak the parameters, and find what works best for your specific dataset and computer vision task. Image preprocessing may not be the sexiest part of building an Al system, but it’s absolutely critical to get right. Put in the work upfront, and you’ll have clean, optimized images ready to feed into your machine learning models. Your computer vision system will thank you, and you’ll achieve better results faster.

        "document": "In today’s digital world, computers are learning to ‘see’ and ‘understand’ images just like humans. But how do they do it? This fascinating journey involves two key fields: Computer Vision and Image Processing. While they may sound similar, they have distinct roles in the world of technology. Let’s dive in to understand these exciting fields better!\n\nImagine you have a photograph that isn’t quite perfect – maybe it’s too dark, or the colors are dull. Image processing is like a magic wand that transforms this photo into a better version. It involves altering or improving digital images using various methods and tools. Think of it as editing a photo to make it look more appealing or to highlight certain features. It’s all about changing the image itself.\n\nNow, imagine a robot looking at the same photograph. Unlike humans, it doesn’t naturally understand what it’s seeing. This is where computer vision comes in. It’s like teaching the robot to recognize and understand the content of the image – is it a picture of a cat, a car, or a tree? Computer vision doesn’t change the image. Instead, it tries to make sense of it, much like how our brain interprets what our eyes see.\n\nComputer Vision (CV): Seeing Beyond the Surface\n\nIn the realm of Computer Vision, the goal is to teach computers to understand and interpret visual information from the world around them.

Object detection is about identifying specific objects within an image. It’s like teaching a computer to not just see a scene, but to understand what each part of that scene is. For instance, in a street scene, it can distinguish cars, people, trees, and buildings.\n\nIn the world of Image Processing, the magic lies in altering and enhancing images to make them more useful or visually appealing. Let’s break down some of the fundamental principles and techniques:\n\nThis is like giving a makeover to an image. Image enhancement can brighten up a dark photo, bring out hidden details, or make colors pop. It’s all about improving the look and feel of an image to make it more pleasing or informative.\n\nImagine sifting through the ‘noise’ to find the real picture. Image filtering involves removing or reducing unwanted elements from an image, like blurring, smoothening rough edges, or sharpening blurry parts. It helps in cleaning up the image to highlight the important features.\n\nThis is where an image can take on a new shape or form. Transformation techniques might include resizing an image, rotating it, or even warping it to change perspective. It’s like reshaping the image to fit a specific purpose or requirement.\n\nThese techniques form the toolbox of image processing, enabling us to manipulate and enhance images in countless ways.\n\nThe primary aim of image processing is to improve image quality. Whether it’s enhancing contrast, adjusting colors, or smoothing edges, the focus is on making the image more visually appealing or suitable for further use. It’s about transforming the raw image into a refined version of itself.\n\nImage processing focuses on enhancing and transforming images. It’s vital in fields like digital photography for color correction, medical imaging for clearer scans, and graphic design for creating stunning visuals. These transformations not only improve aesthetics but also make images more suitable for analysis, laying the groundwork for deeper interpretation, including by computer vision systems.\n\nComputer vision, on the other hand, seeks to extract meaning from images. The goal isn’t to change how the image looks but to understand what the image represents. This involves identifying objects, interpreting scenes, and even recognizing patterns and behaviors within the image. It’s more about comprehension rather than alteration.\n\nComputer Vision, conversely, aims to extract meaning and understanding from images. It’s at the heart of AI and robotics, helping machines recognize faces, interpret road scenes for autonomous vehicles, and understand human behavior. The success of these tasks often relies on the quality of image processing. High-quality, well-processed images can significantly enhance the accuracy of computer vision algorithms.\n\nIn image processing, the toolkit includes a range of software and algorithms specifically designed for modifying images. This includes:\n\nSoftware like Photoshop and GIMP, for manual edits such as retouching and resizing.\n\nAlgorithms for automated tasks like histogram equalization for contrast adjustment and filters for noise reduction and edge enhancement.\n\nComputer Vision, on the other hand, employs a different set of methodologies:\n\nMachine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are pivotal for tasks like image classification and object recognition.\n\nPattern Recognition Tools are used to identify and classify objects within an image, essential for applications like facial recognition.\n\nThis section illustrates the essential relationship between image processing and computer vision, showcasing their collaborative role in advanced technological applications.\n\nImage Processing often serves as the foundation for Computer Vision tasks. For instance:\n\nPre-processing in Computer Vision: Many computer vision algorithms require pre-processed images. Techniques like noise reduction and contrast enhancement from image processing improve the accuracy of computer vision tasks.\n\nFeature Extraction: Simplified or enhanced images from image processing are easier for computer vision algorithms to analyze and interpret.\n\nBoth fields often work in tandem in complex systems:\n\nAutonomous Vehicles: Computer vision systems rely on image processing to clarify and enhance road imagery for better object detection and obstacle avoidance.\n\nMedical Imaging Analysis: Image processing is used to enhance medical images like MRIs or X-rays, which are then analyzed by computer vision algorithms for diagnosis and research.\n\nMedical Imaging: Image processing enhances medical scans for clarity, which are then analyzed by computer vision to detect abnormalities, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment planning.\n\nAutonomous Vehicles: Utilize image processing for clear visual input, which is essential for computer vision systems to accurately identify and react to road signs, pedestrians, and other vehicles.\n\nSecurity Systems: Image processing improves image quality from cameras, aiding computer vision in accurately recognizing faces or suspicious activities and enhancing security measures.\n\nFilm and Gaming: Image processing is used for visual effects, while computer vision contributes to interactive experiences, like augmented reality games.\n\nTraffic Management Systems: Utilize image processing to enhance traffic camera feeds, which are then analyzed by computer vision for managing traffic flow and detecting incidents.\n\nCrop Monitoring Systems: Image processing clarifies aerial images of crops, and computer vision analyzes these images to assess crop health and growth, optimizing agricultural practices.\n\nThese examples and case studies highlight the impactful and transformative role of image processing and computer vision across various sectors, demonstrating their critical contribution to technological advancements.\n\nConclusion: The Convergence of Vision and Processing in the Digital Age\n\nsummary, Computer Vision and Image Processing, though distinct in their goals and techniques, are interconnected fields that play a pivotal role in the advancement of modern technology.

M. Pizer et al. in 1987, which improves contrast and feature visibility.\n\nPreparing machine learning models involves more than preprocessing individual images. It requires uniform processing of the entire dataset. L. Spacek's insights on edge detection and motion detection in 1986 highlight the importance of robust preprocessing, especially for complex images.\n\nSignificant advancements in preprocessing have also been seen in medical imaging. For example, the 1992 article on \"Region-based contrast enhancement of mammograms\" in IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging showcases the broad applicability of preprocessing across various fields and image types.\n\nA systematic approach to preprocessing, from pixel adjustments to complex enhancements, significantly improves image classification accuracy. This thorough preparation is crucial for the success of image-based AI systems. Therefore, focusing on effective preprocessing strategies is essential for high-performance image classification outcomes.\n\nIn the realm of image classification, the accuracy of loading and converting images is paramount.

Adjusting brightness and contrast, reducing noise, or augmenting datasets are key steps. These actions are essential for reliable and robust imagery insights.\n\nWhat are the best practices for image preprocessing in image classification?\n\nFor image preprocessing in image classification, it's essential to use techniques like resizing, noise reduction, normalization, contrast enhancement, and feature extraction. Libraries such as OpenCV, Pillow, and scikit-image are invaluable. They ensure images are prepared optimally for analysis and machine learning.\n\nHow do you load and convert images using Python libraries like OpenCV and Pillow?\n\nOpenCV and Pillow are pivotal in loading and converting images in Python. OpenCV adeptly handles various formats and converts between color spaces, such as BGR to Grayscale. Pillow, an extension of the Python Image Library (PIL), supports a wide array of formats. It's user-friendly for tasks like loading images and converting color spaces.\n\nWhy is resizing and cropping images important in preprocessing?\n\nResizing and cropping are vital for consistent input sizes in machine learning algorithms, enhancing model performance. OpenCV or Pillow can resize images to standard dimensions like 224x224 pixels. Cropping ensures the most relevant parts of an image are kept, crucial for accurate analysis.\n\nWhat methods are used for normalizing pixel values during image preprocessing?\n\nNormalizing pixel values involves rescaling to a 0–1 range, applying histogram equalization for even distribution of pixel intensities, and standardizing data for zero mean and unit variance. These methods ensure consistent brightness and contrast, preparing images for enhanced analysis.\n\nWhat filters can you apply to reduce noise and enhance image quality?\n\nFilters like Gaussian blur for smoothing, median blur for isolated noise removal, unsharp masking for sharpening, and bilateral filters for preserving edges while reducing noise are crucial. The Laplacian filter is also used for edge detection, vital for feature extraction.\n\nImage augmentation techniques, including flipping, rotating, adding noise, and blurring, artificially increase the size and variety of the training dataset. Advanced libraries for augmentation create complex transformations. This trains more robust machine learning models capable of handling diverse real-world conditions.\n\nWhat is the role of image segmentation in preprocessing?\n\nImage segmentation is essential in preprocessing by detecting and removing backgrounds to isolate the subject of interest. Techniques like thresholding separate subjects at the pixel level based on intensity. This ensures cleaner data and focuses analysis on target objects.\n\nWhat are some common techniques for feature extraction in image processing?\n\nCommon feature extraction techniques include edge detection (e.g., Canny method), corner detection to identify regions of high gradient change, and texture analysis to examine patterns within images. These techniques provide meaningful information, aiding in accurate image classification and analysis."
