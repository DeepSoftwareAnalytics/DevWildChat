        "document": "This blog post provides a brief introduction to extracting unformatted text from EPUB files. The occasion for this work was a request by my Digital Humanities colleagues who are involved in the SANE (Secure ANalysis Environment) project. The work on this project includes a use case that will use the SANE environment to analyse text from novels in EPUB format. My colleagues were looking for some advice on how to implement the text extraction component, preferably using a Python-based solution.\n\nSo, I started by making a shortlist of potentially suitable tools. For each tool, I wrote a minimal code snippet for processing one file. Based on this I then created some simple demo scripts that show how each tool is used within a processing workflow. Next, I applied these scripts to two data sets, and used the results to obtain a first impression of the performance of each of the tools.\n• Tika-python. This is a Python wrapper for Apache Tika (which itself is a Java application). Apache Tika is a toolkit for text and metadata extraction from a wide range of file formats, including EPUB.\n• Textract. This offers text extraction functionality that is similar to Tika, but unlike Tika, Textract is natively written in Python.\n• EbookLib. This is a Python library for reading and writing E-books in various formats, including EPUB (both EPUB 2 en EPUB 3). EbookLib is also the E-book library that is used by Textract.\n• PyMuPDF. This is a Python binding for MuPDF. MuPDF is primarily a PDF library, but it also supports EPUB.\n\nThe following table shows the versions of these tools that I used in my tests:\n\nFor all of my tests I used a simple desktop PC running Linux Mint 20.1 (Ulyssa), MATE edition, with Python 3.8.10.\n• A selection of 15 files in EPUB 2.0.1 format from the KB’s DBNL (Digital Library for Dutch Literature) collection.\n• A selection of 10 files in EPUB 3.2 format from Standard Ebooks.\n\nAll files in both data sets are structurally valid EPUB (2.0.1 / 3.2): validation with EPUBCheck 4.2.6 didn’t result in any reported errors or warnings.\n\nAfter installing Tika-python, as a first test I tried to write a minimal code snippet that extracts the text from one single EPUB, and then writes the result as UTF-8 encoded text to a file. Following Tika-python’s README (the example under “Parser Interface”), I started out with with this:\n\nInspection of the resulting output file showed a succession of text strings with the names of embedded fonts towards the end of the file. As an example:\n\nWhen I ran Tika (the Java application) directly without using the Tika-python wrapper, results were as expected. A closer inspection of the Tika-python source code showed that Tika-python’s parsing of the Tika output doesn’t quite work the way it should, with the result that extracted metadata is erroneously included in the text output.\n\nFortunately there’s a simple workaround for this. In the parser function call, just add the “service” parameter and set its value to “text”, as shown here:\n\nWith this change, the font-related text strings were no longer reported.\n\nUnfortunately, setting the “service” parameter in this way has the unexpected side-effect that the text output now includes tags with alt-text descriptions for any images in the file. For example:\n\nDifferent behaviour between Tika app and TikaServer\n\nI initially thought this was also a bug in Tika-python, but it turns out this isn’t the case. Using the Tika Java application directly:\n\nThis resulted in an output file with no alt-text strings. However, Tika-python doesn’t wrap around Tika-app, but instead around TikaServer. After starting TikaServer, I used the command below to processes the same EPUB:\n\nThe resulting file also included the offending image tags and alt-text strings. So, the Tika application and TikaServer behave differently. After reporting an issue for this, I received a confirmation from Tika’s lead developer:\n\nI also created a separate issue at Tika-python for the inclusion of metadata in the text output. Unfortunately this issue is closely related to (and partly the result of) the upstream issue in TikaServer. So until that upstream issue is fixed, the current (slightly confusing) situation will most likely persist.\n\nBy default, Tika applies optical character recognition (OCR) to any images in an EPUB if the Tesseract software is installed, and includes the OCR output in the extracted text. In many cases (at least for ours!) this might not be the desired behaviour. I only found out about this weeks after doing the original tests that are described in this post. Re-running some of the tests suddenly resulted in slightly larger output files, with text output that wasn’t originally there. It turns out that the root cause was that I had installed some software that installs Tesseract as a dependency (but I wasn’t aware of this). It’s possible to disable OCR in the Java application and TikaServer using a command-line option that points to a configuration file. I haven’t found a way to do this in Tika-python. The safest option might be to make sure that Teseract is not installed, or to rename Tesseract’s installation folder.\n\nAs with Tika-python, as a first test I again created a minimal code snippet for processing one EPUB file:\n\nFor the very first EPUB file (from the DBNL collection) this resulted in an empty output file. Results were similar for most other DBNL EPUBs, and Textract only managed to extract a handful of words at most. Results were considerably better for the “Standard Ebooks” files, with output that was similar to Tika-python in most cases. I reported this issue with the developers.\n\nI mainly included EbookLib, because Textract uses it “under the hood” for EPUB, and I was curious if using it directly would give me similar results as Textract. Based on its documentation I created the following minimal code snippet:\n\nCompared to Tika-python and Textract, the EbookLib script is a bit more involved, as EbookLib doesn’t provide any high-level text extraction functions. Instead, the user must iterate over all document items, extract the (X)HTML, and then convert that to unformatted text. At first glance, tests with the DBNL and Standard Ebooks EPUBs didn’t result in any issues, and the results were similar to Tika-python.\n\nFor PyMuPDF, I created the following minimal code snippet:\n\nThere are a couple of things to note here.\n\nFirst, like EbookLib, we need to explicitly iterate over all chapters in the EPUB. Second, PyMuPDF’s document model is built on pages, which probably reflects its origins as a PDF library. However, the EPUB format doesn’t really have any notion of “pages” at all. Nevertheless, since PyMuPDF’s text extraction function only works at the page level, we still need to iterate over the “pages” of each chapter, even though it’s not entirely clear to me how PyMuPDF defines them. Since by default the chapter texts are simply concatenated, I explicitly added a linebreak to more clearly delineate the end of each chapter.\n\nUnlike the other tools tested here, PyMuPDF wraps the extracted text to a fixed page width, and inserts linebreaks at the wrapping boundaries. As an example, look at the following sentence in the source XHTML, which is encoded as one single line:\n\nIn the corresponding PyMuPDF output, the text is split across two separate lines:\n\nWhether this is actually a problem will probably depend on the use case, but it’s good to be aware that this happens.\n\nFinally, for the EPUBs in the KB’s DBNL dataset, PyMuPDF reported multiple instances of the following error:\n\nThe error is related to a style sheet, and doesn’t appear to affect text extraction.\n\nBased on the above minimal code snippets, I created four simple demonstration scripts for Python-tika, Textract, Ebooklib and PyMuPDF. Each of these scripts extracts the text of each EPUB file in a user-defined input directory. The extracted text is then written to a user-defined output directory. Each script also writes a file with word counts for the extraction results, which is useful for a rough comparison of the different tools.\n\nI ran each script twice, using the DBNL and Standard Ebooks data sets as input, respectively.\n\nThe table below shows the resulting word counts for the books in the DBNL data set:\n\nNote the extreme (near zero) word counts for Textract. The results for Tika, EbookLib and PyMuPDF are roughly the same.\n\nRunning the scripts on the Standard Ebooks EPUBs gave the following result:\n\nIn this case, all four tools resulted in similar word counts. The exception here is the “King Lear” EPUB, which for Textract gave a word count that was about 10 thousand lower than for the other tools. I haven’t looked in detail where this difference is coming from exactly, but it confirms that in its current state, Textract isn’t a suitable tool for our purposes.\n\nDepending on the structure of the source EPUB, the extraction result may or may not contain a table of contents. In EPUB 2, the table of contents is implemented as an XML-formatted “Navigation Control File” (NCX). The NCX was replaced by the “Navigation Document” (which is an XHTML file) in EPUB 3. Neither Tika nor EbookLib extract NCX resources, but both do extract Navigation Documents. Consequently, in most cases the extraction result only includes a table of contents for EPUB 3 files. Both Textract and PyMuPDF extract neither the NCX nor the Navigation Document.\n\nBased on these tests, Tika-python, EbookLib and PyMuPDF all look like potentially suitable Python-based tools for extracting unformatted text from EPUB files. Out of these, Tika-python provides the most straightforward interface. Tika also supports a wide range of other file formats, so any code based on Tika’s text extraction can be easily extended to other formats later.\n\nThe inclusion of tags and alt-text descriptions for images in Tika’s output may be a problem though. As an example, imagine a researcher who uses Tika-python to analyse the emergence of certain words or phrases through time using EPUB versions of 19th century books. Any alt-text descriptions in such materials would most likely be contemporary, and as such they would “pollute” the original “signal” (19th century text) with modern language. So, prospective users of Tika-python should carefully review whether this behaviour is acceptable for their use case. The inclusion of optical character recognition output from embedded images in the extraction result can also result in some unexpected surprises, so it’s important that users are aware of Tika’s default behaviour in this regard.\n\nEbookLib doesn’t have these drawbacks, but the absence of a high-level text extraction interface does require some more work on the user’s side. Also, since EbookLib only supports a limited number of Ebook formats, extending any code based on it to other file formats will be less straightforward.\n\nAlthough PyMuPDF generally looks useful for EPUB text extraction, its built-in text wrapping with the addition of linebreaks might be unwanted for some use cases. PyMuPDF’s page-based document model also makes this library somewhat more involved to use, compared against the other tested tools.\n\nIn its current form, Textract is not suitable for our use case.\n\nIt’s important to highlight the limitations of this analysis. First, it is based on only two small, homogeneous data sets, both of which only contain structurally valid EPUB files. It’s unclear how well these results translate to more heterogeneous collections (which often contain files that violate the format specifications in various ways). Second, the main objective here was to obtain a broad impression of the behaviour of the tested tools. The scope didn’t include an in-depth analysis of the accuracy and completeness of the extraction results. Finally, I didn’t look into the computational performance of the tested tools. As the SANE use case will only involve processing a limited number of files, performance isn’t important here."

        "document": "Python Pillow allows you to manipulate images and perform basic image processing tasks. As a fork of the Python Imaging Library (PIL), Pillow supports image formats like JPEG, PNG, and more, enabling you to read, edit, and save images. With Python Pillow, you can crop, resize, rotate, and apply filters to images, making it a versatile tool for image manipulation.\n\nPillow is often used for high-level image processing tasks and exploratory work. While not the fastest library, it offers a gentle learning curve and a comprehensive set of features for basic to intermediate image processing needs. You can enhance its capabilities by integrating it with NumPy for pixel-level manipulations and creating animations.\n\nBy the end of this tutorial, you’ll understand that:\n• Python Pillow is used for image manipulation and basic image processing.\n• Pillow offers reasonable speed for its intended use cases.\n• PIL is the original library, while Pillow is its actively maintained fork.\n• You read an image in Python Pillow using from the PIL module.\n• Pillow is used for its ease of use, versatility, and integration with NumPy.\n\nWith these insights, you’re ready to dive into the world of image processing with Python Pillow. You’ll use several images in this tutorial, which you can download from the tutorial’s image repository:\n\nWith these images in hand, you’re now ready to get started with Pillow.\n\nThe Python Pillow library is a fork of an older library called PIL. PIL stands for Python Imaging Library, and it’s the original library that enabled Python to deal with images. PIL was discontinued in 2011 and only supports Python 2. To use its developers’ own description, Pillow is the friendly PIL fork that kept the library alive and includes support for Python 3. There’s more than one module in Python to deal with images and perform image processing. If you want to deal with images directly by manipulating their pixels, then you can use NumPy and SciPy. Other popular libraries for image processing are OpenCV, scikit-image, and Mahotas. Some of these libraries are faster and more powerful than Pillow. However, Pillow remains an important tool for dealing with images. It provides image processing features that are similar to ones found in image processing software such as Photoshop. Pillow is often the preferred option for high-level image processing tasks that don’t require more advanced image processing expertise. It’s also often used for exploratory work when dealing with images. Pillow also has the advantage of being widely used by the Python community, and it doesn’t have the same steep learning curve as some of the other image processing libraries. You’ll need to install the library before you can use it. You can install Pillow using within a virtual environment: Now that you’ve installed the package, you’re ready to start familiarizing yourself with the Python Pillow library and perform basic manipulations of images. The Module and Class in Pillow The main class defined in Pillow is the class. When you read an image using Pillow, the image is stored in an object of type . For the code in this section, you’ll need the image file named (image credit), which you can find in the image repository for this tutorial: Get Images: Click here to get access to the images that you’ll manipulate and process with Pillow. You can place this image file in the project folder that you’re working in. When exploring images with Pillow, it’s best to use an interactive REPL environment. You’ll start by opening the image that you just downloaded: You might expect to import from Pillow instead of from PIL. You did install , after all, not . However, Pillow is a fork of the PIL library. Therefore, you’ll still need to use when importing into your code. You call the function to read the image from the file and to read the image into memory so that the file can now be closed. You use a statement to create a context manager to ensure the file is closed as soon as it’s no longer needed. In this example, the object is a JPEG image-specific type that’s a subclass of the class, as you confirm with the call to . Note that both the class and the module where the class is defined share the same name, . You can display the image using : The method saves the image as a temporary file and displays it using your operating system’s native software for dealing with images. When you run the code above, you’ll see the following image displayed: On some systems, calling will block the REPL until you close the image. This depends on the operating system and the default image viewing software that you’re using. You’ll need to be familiar with three key properties when dealing with images in the Python Pillow library. You can explore these using the class attributes , , and : The format of an image shows what type of image you’re dealing with. In this case, the format of the image is . The size shows the width and height of the image in pixels. The mode of this image is . You’ll learn more about modes shortly. Often, you may need to crop and resize images. The class has two methods that you can use to perform these operations, and : The argument to must be a 4-tuple that defines the left, upper, right, and bottom edges of the region that you wish to crop. The coordinate system used in Pillow assigns the coordinates (0, 0) to the pixel in the upper-left corner. This is the same coordinate system that’s usually used for two-dimensional arrays. The 4-tuple represents the following section of the image: The new image that returns in the code above has a size of pixels. The cropped image shows only one of the buildings from the original picture: In the code above, you also change the resolution of the cropped image using , which needs a tuple as a required argument. The tuple that you use as an argument defines the new width and height of the image in pixels. In the example above, you’re setting the new width and height to a quarter of their original values using the floor division operator ( ) and the attributes and . The final call to displays the cropped and resized image: There are additional optional parameters that you can use with to control how the image is resampled. Alternatively, you can achieve similar scaling using : The argument determines the factor by which you scale the image down. If you prefer to set a maximum size rather than a scaling factor, then you can use . The size of the thumbnail will be smaller than or equal to the size that you set. Note: The method changes the object in place and doesn’t return a new object. However, , , and all return a new object. Not all methods in the Pillow library behave in the same way. Once you’re happy with your returned image, you can save any of the objects to file using : Once you call the method, it creates the image files in your project folder. In this example, one of the images is a JPEG image and the other is a PNG image. The extension that you use as a filname automatically determines the file format, or you can specify the format as an additional optional argument. You can manipulate the image beyond cropping and resizing. Another common requirement is to rotate or flip the image. You can use the method for some transformations. Go ahead and carry on with the same REPL session that you started in the previous section: This code displays the following image: There are seven options that you can pass as arguments to :\n• : Flips the image left to right, resulting in a mirror image\n• : Rotates the image by 270 degrees counterclockwise, which is the same as 90 degrees clockwise\n• : Transposes the rows and columns using the top-left pixel as the origin, with the top-left pixel being the same in the transposed image as in the original image\n• : Transposes the rows and columns using the bottom-left pixel as the origin, with the bottom-left pixel being the one that remains fixed between the original and modified versions All the rotation options above define rotations in steps of 90 degrees. If you need to rotate an image by another angle, then you can use : This method call rotates the image by 45 degrees counterclockwise, giving the following image: The object returned is the same size as the original . Therefore, the corners of the image are missing in this display. You can change this behavior using the named parameter: This method returns a larger image that fully contains the rotated image: You can customize the rotation further with additional optional parameters. You can now change the size and orientation of an image. In the next section, you’ll learn about different types of images in the Python Pillow library. Bands and Modes of an Image in the Python Pillow Library An image is a two-dimensional array of pixels, where each pixel corresponds to a color. Each pixel can be represented by one or more values. For example, in an RGB image, each pixel is represented by three values corresponding to the red, green, and blue values for that pixel. Therefore, the object for an RBG image contains three bands, one for each color. An RGB image of size pixels is represented by a array of values. RGBA images also include the alpha value, which contains information about the transparency for each pixel. An RGBA image has four bands, one for each of the colors and a fourth one containing the alpha values. Each band has the same dimensions as the image dimensions. Therefore, an RGBA image of size pixels is represented by a array of values. The mode of an image describes what type of image you’re working with. Pillow supports most standard modes, including black-and-white (binary), grayscale, RGB, RGBA, and CMYK. You can see the full list of supported modes in the Pillow documentation on modes. You can find out how many bands are in an object using the method, and you can convert between modes using . Now you’ll use the image named (image credit) from the image repository for this tutorial: This image’s mode is also RGB. You can convert this image into other modes. This code uses the same REPL session that you started in the previous sections: You call twice to convert the RGB image into a CMYK and a grayscale version. The CMYK image looks similar to the original image but is encoded using the mode that’s common for printed material rather than digital displays. The conversion to grayscale gives the following output: The outputs from the calls to confirm that there are three bands in the RGB image, four bands in the CMYK image, and one band in the grayscale image. You can separate an image into its bands using and combine separate bands back into an object using . When you use , the method returns all the bands as separate objects. You can confirm this by displaying the string representation of one of the objects returned: The mode of the object that returns is , indicating this is a grayscale image, or an image that only displays the luminance values of each pixel. Now, you can create three new RGB images showing the red, green, and blue channels separately using , which is a function in the module: The first argument in determines the mode of the image that you want to create. The second argument contains the individual bands that you want to merge into a single image. The red band alone, stored in the variable , is a grayscale image with mode L. To create the image showing only the red channel, you merge the red band from the original image with green and blue bands that only contain zeros. To create a band containing zeros everywhere, you use the method. This method needs a function as an argument. The function that you use determines how each point transforms. In this case, you use a function to map each point to . When you merge the red band with green and blue bands containing zeros, you get an RGB image called . Therefore, the RGB image that you create only has non-zero values in the red channel, but because it’s still an RGB image, it’ll display in color. You also repeat a similar process to obtain and , which contain RGB images with the green and blue channels from the original image. The code displays the following three images: The red image contains a strong signal in the pixels that represent the strawberry, because these pixels are mostly red. The green and blue channels show these pixels as dark because they have small values. The exceptions are those pixels that represent the reflection of the light on the surface of the strawberry as these pixels are nearly white. Creating the side-by-side displays shown in this tutorialShow/Hide In this tutorial, when there are several images output in the code that need to be displayed next to one another to make comparisons easier, the images are displayed side by side rather than as separate images. These side-by-side displays were created using Pillow itself. You can use the function , shown below, to merge several images into a single display: The first parameter in uses the unpacking operator ( ) so that any number of objects of type can be used as input arguments. The keyword parameter can be set to if you want to tile the images vertically rather than horizontally. This function assumes that all images have the same size. The overall size of the display is calculated from the size of the images and the number of images used. You then create a new object with the same mode as the original images and with the size of the overal display. The loop pastes the images that you input when you call the function into the final display. The function returns the final object containing all the images side by side. The image in the main article showing the three color channels for the strawberry image was obtained by calling the function as follows: This function was used to generate all the displays that show more than one image in this tutorial.\n\nYou’ve learned how to crop and rotate images, resize them, and extract color bands from color images. However, none of the actions that you’ve taken so far have made any changes to the content of the image. In this section, you’ll learn about image processing features in the Python Pillow library. You’ll use the module in Pillow. One of the methods that’s used in image processing is image convolution using kernels. The aim of this tutorial is not to give a detailed explanation of image processing theory. If you’re interested in the science of image processing, one of the best resources that you can use is Digital Image Processing by Gonzalez and Woods. In this section, you’ll learn the basics of how you can use convolution kernels to perform image processing. But what’s a convolution kernel? A kernel is a matrix: You can consider a simple image to understand the process of convolution using kernels. The image has a size of pixels and contains a vertical line and a dot. The line is four pixels wide, and the dot consists of a pixel square. The image below is enlarged for display purposes: You can place the kernel anywhere on the image and use the location of the kernel’s central cell as a reference. The diagram below is a representation of the top-left portion of the image: The elements in this diagram represent different aspects of the image and the kernel:\n• The white squares represent pixels in the image that have a value of .\n• The red squares represent pixels in the image that have a value of . These make up the dot in the image shown above.\n• Each purple region represents the kernel. This kernel consists of a region, and each cell in the kernel has a value of . The diagram shows the kernel in three different positions labeled 1, 2, and 3. A new image can be created as a result of the convolution of the image with the kernel. You can understand the convolution process through the following steps:\n• Locate kernel: Consider one of the kernel locations and look at the image pixels covered by the kernel’s nine cells.\n• Multiply kernel and pixel values: Multiply the values in each of the kernel’s cells with the corresponding pixel values in the image. You’ll have nine values from the nine multiplications.\n• Sum results of multiplications: Add those nine values together. The result will be the value of the pixel in the new image that has the same coordinates as the kernel’s center pixel.\n• Repeat for all pixels: Repeat the process for every pixel in the image, moving the kernel each time so that the kernel’s central cell corresponds to a different image pixel each time. You can see this process with the three kernel positions labeled 1, 2, and 3 in diagram above. Consider the kernel position labeled 1. The position of this kernel is , which is the position of its central cell because it’s in the fourth row (index = ) and the third column (index = ). Each image pixel in the region covered by the kernel has a value of zero. Therefore, all the multiplications from step 2 will be zero, and their addition will also be zero. The new image will have a value of zero at pixel . The scenario is different for the other kernel positions shown. Next, consider the kernel labeled 2, located at . One of the image pixels overlapping this is not zero. The multiplication of this pixel value with the kernel value will give . The eight remaining multiplications are still zero because the image pixels are zero. Therefore, the value of the pixel at position in the new image will be . The third kernel position illustrated above is at . There are four non-zero image pixels overlapping with this kernel. Each one has a value of , so the multiplication result will again be for each of those pixel positions. The overall result for this kernel position is . The new image will have this value at . The diagram and the discussion above only consider three kernel positions. The convolution process repeats this process for every possible kernel position in the image. This gives a value for each pixel position in the new image. The result of the convolution is shown on the right in the following image, with the original image on the left: The kernel that you used is a box blur kernel. The factor of is there so that the overall weighting of the kernel is . The result of the convolution is a blurred version of the original image. There are other kernels that perform different functions, including different blurring methods, edge detection, sharpening, and more. The Python Pillow library has several built-in kernels and functions that’ll perform the convolution described above. You don’t need to understand the math of filtering through convolution to use these filters, but it always helps to know what’s happening behind the scenes when using these tools. The next sections will look at the kernels and image filtering capabilities available in the module in Pillow. You’ll return to using the image of the buildings that you used at the beginning of this tutorial. You can start a new REPL session for this section: In addition to , you also import the module from Pillow. You can use the method to apply filtering to the image. This method needs a convolution kernel as its argument, and you can use one of the several kernels available in the module in Pillow. The first set of filters that you’ll learn about deal with blurring, sharpening, and smoothing an image. You can blur the image using the predefined filter: The displayed image is a blurred version of the original one. You can zoom in to observe the difference in more detail using and then display the images again using : The two cropped images show the difference between the two versions: You can customize the type and amount of blurring that you need using or : You can see the three blurred images below, shown in the same order as in the code above: The filter is similar to the one described in the previous section introducing convolution kernels. The argument is the radius of the box blur filter. In the earlier section discussing kernels, the box blur filter that you used was a filter. This means that it had a radius of , because the filter extends by one pixel from the center. The blurred images show that the box blur filter with a radius of produces an image that’s more blurred than the image generated by the box blur filter with radius . You can also use the filter, which uses a Gaussian blur kernel. The Gaussian kernel puts more weight on the pixels at the center of the kernel than those at the edges, and this leads to smoother blurring than what’s obtained with the box blur. For this reason, Gaussian blurring can give better results in many cases. What if you want to sharpen an image? In that case, you can use the filter and compare the result with the original image: You’re comparing a cropped version of both images showing a small portion of the building. The sharpened image is on the right: Perhaps instead of sharpening an image, you need to smooth it. You can achieve this by passing as an argument for : Below, you can see the original image on the left and the smoothed image on the right: You’ll see an application of the smooth filter in the next section, in which you’ll learn about more filters in the module. These filters act on the edges of objects in the image. When you look at an image, it’s relatively easy to determine the edges of objects within that image. It’s also possible for an algorithm to detect edges automatically using edge detection kernels. The module in Pillow has a predefined kernel to achieve this. In this section, you’ll use the image of the buildings again and convert it to grayscale before you apply the edge detection filter. You can carry on with the REPL session from the previous section: The result is an image showing the edges from the original image: This filter identifies the edges in the image. You can obtain a better outcome by applying the filter before finding the edges: You can see a comparison of the original grayscale image and the two edge detection results below. The version with smoothing before edge detection is shown at the bottom: You can also enhance the edges of the original image with the filter: You used the smoothed version of the grayscale image to enhance the edges. A portion of the original grayscale image and the image with the edges enhanced are shown side by side below. The image with edge enhancement is on the right: Another predefined filter in that deals with object edges is . You can pass it as an argument to as you did with the other filters in this section: You’re using the smoothed, grayscale version as a starting point for this filter. You can see the embossed image below, which shows a different effect using the edges in the image: In this section, you’ve learned about several filters available in the module that you can apply to images. There are other filters that you can use to process images. You can see a list of all the filters available in the documentation.\n\nImage Segmentation and Superimposition: An Example In this section, you’ll use the image files named (image credit) and (image credit), which you can find in the image repository for this tutorial: Get Images: Click here to get access to the images that you’ll manipulate and process with Pillow. You can use the Python Pillow library to extract the cat from the first image and place it on the floor of the monastery courtyard. You’ll use a number of image processing techniques to achieve this. You’ll start by working on . You’ll need to remove the picture of the cat from the background using image segmentation techniques. In this example, you’ll segment the image using thresholding techniques. First, you can crop the image to a smaller one to remove some of the background. You can start a new REPL session for this project: The cropped image contains the cat and some of the background that’s too close to the cat for you to crop it: Each pixel in a color image is represented digitally by three numbers corresponding to the red, green, and blue values of that pixel. Thresholding is the process of converting all the pixels to either the maximum or minimum value depending on whether they’re higher or lower than a certain number. It’s easier to do this on a grayscale image: You achieve thresholding by calling to convert each pixel in the grayscale image into either or . The conversion depends on whether the value in the grayscale image is greater or smaller than the threshold value. The threshold value in this example is . The figure below shows the grayscale image and the result from the thresholding process: In this example, all the points in the grayscale image that had a pixel value greater than are converted to white, and all other pixels are changed to black. You can change the sensitivity of the thresholding process by varying the threshold value. Thresholding can be used to segment images when the object to segment is distinct from the background. You can achieve better results with versions of the original image that have higher contrast. In this example, you can achieve higher contrast by thresholding the blue channel of the original image rather than the grayscale image, because the dominant colors in the background are brown and green colors, which have a weak blue component. You can extract the red, green, and blue channels from the color image as you did earlier: The red, green, and blue channels are shown below, from left to right. All three are displayed as grayscale images: The blue channel has a higher contrast between the pixels representing the cat and those representing the background. You can use the blue channel image to threshold: You use a threshold value of in this example. You also convert the image into a binary mode using as an argument to . The pixels in a binary image can only have the values of or . Note: When dealing with certain image formats, such as JPEG, that rely on lossy compression, the images may vary slightly depending on which JPEG decoders you’re using. Different operating systems often come with different default JPEG decoders. Therefore, the results that you get when processing images may vary depending on the operating system and JPEG decoder that you’re using. You may need to slightly adjust the threshold value if your results do not match the ones shown in this tutorial. The result of thresholding is the following: You can identify the cat in this black-and-white image. However, you’d like to have an image in which all the pixels that correspond to the cat are white and all other pixels are black. In this image, you still have black regions in the area which corresponds to the cat, such as where the eyes, nose and mouth are, and you also still have white pixels elsewhere in the image. You can use the image processing techniques called erosion and dilation to create a better mask that represents the cat. You’ll learn about these two techniques in the next section. You can look at the image file called , which you can download from the repository linked to this tutorial: The left-hand side of this binary image shows a white dot on a black background, while the right-hand side shows a black hole in a solid white section. Erosion is the process of removing white pixels from the boundaries in an image. You can achieve this in a binary image by using as an argument for the method. This filter replaces the value of a pixel with the minimum value of the nine pixels in the array centered around the pixel. In a binary image, this means that a pixel will have the value of zero if any of its neighboring pixels are zero. You can see the effect of erosion by applying several times to the image. You should continue with the same REPL session as in the previous section: You’ve applied the filter three times using a loop. This code gives the following output: The dot has shrunk but the hole has grown as a result of erosion. Dilation is the opposite process to erosion. White pixels are added to the boundaries in a binary image. You can achieve dilation by using , which converts a pixel to white if any of its neighbors are white. You can apply dilation to the same image containing a dot and a hole, which you can open and load again: The dot has now grown bigger, and the hole has shrunk: You can use erosion and dilation together to fill in holes and remove small objects from a binary image. Using the image with a dot and hole, you can perform ten erosion cycles to remove the dot, followed by ten dilation cycles to restore the hole to its original size: You perform ten erosion cycles with the first loop. The image at this stage is the following: The dot has disappeared, and the hole is larger than it was in the original image. The second loop performs ten dilation cycles, which return the hole to its original size: However, the dot is no longer present in the image. The erosions and dilations have modified the image to keep the hole but remove the dot. The number of erosions and dilations needed depends on the image and what you want to achieve. Often, you’ll need to find the right combination through trial and error. You can define functions to perform several cycles of erosion and dilation: These functions make it easier to experiment with erosion and dilation for an image. You’ll use these functions in the next section as you continue working on placing the cat into the monastery. You can use a sequence of erosions and dilations on the threshold image that you obtained earlier to remove parts of the mask that don’t represent the cat and to fill in any gaps in the region containing the cat. Once you’ve experimented with erosion and dilation, you’ll be able to use educated guesses in a trial-and-error process to find the best combination of erosions and dilations to achieve the ideal mask. Starting with the image , which you obtained earlier, you can start with a series of erosions to remove the white pixels that represent the background in the original image. You should continue working in the same REPL session as in the previous sections: The eroded threshold image no longer contains white pixels representing the background of the image: However, the remaining mask is smaller than the overall outline of the cat and has holes and gaps within it. You can perform dilations to fill the gaps: The fifty-eight cycles of dilation filled all the holes in the mask to give the following image: However, this mask is too big. You can therefore finish the process with a series of erosions: The result is a mask that you can use to segment the image of the cat: You can avoid the sharp edges of a binary mask by blurring this mask. You’ll have to convert it from a binary image into a grayscale image first: The filter returns the following mask: The mask now looks like a cat! Now you’re ready to extract the image of the cat from its background: First, you create a blank image with the same size as . You create a new object from by using and setting all values to zero. Next, you use the function in to create an image made up from both and using to determine which parts of each image are used. The composite image is shown below: You’ve segmented the image of the cat and extracted the cat from its background. You can go a step further and paste the segmented image of the cat into the image of the monastery courtyard from the image repository for this tutorial: You’ve used to paste an image onto another one. This method can be used with three arguments:\n• The first argument is the image that you want to paste in. You’re resizing the image to one-fifth of its size using the integer division operator ( ).\n• The second argument is the location in the main image where you want to paste the second picture. The tuple includes the coordinates within the main image where you want to place the top-left corner of the image that you’re pasting in.\n• The third argument provides the mask that you wish to use if you don’t want to paste the entire image. You’ve used the mask that you obtained from the process of thresholding, erosion, and dilation to paste the cat without its background. The output is the following image: You’ve segmented the cat from one image and placed it into another image to show the cat sitting quietly in the monastery courtyard rather than in the field where it was sitting in the original image. Your final task in this example is to add the Real Python logo as a watermark to the image. You can get the image file with the Real Python logo from the repository accompanying this tutorial: Get Images: Click here to get access to the images that you’ll manipulate and process with Pillow. You should continue working in the same REPL session: This is the full-size logo in color: You can change the image to grayscale and threshold it using to transform it into a black-and-white image. You also reduce its size and transform it into a contour image: The output shows the contour from the Real Python logo. The contour is ideal for using as a watermark on your image: To use this as a watermark, you’ll need to reverse the colors so that the background is black and only the outline that you want to keep is white. You can achieve this using again: You’ve converted the pixels that had a value of and assigned them the value , converting them from white to black pixels. You set the remaining pixels to white. The reversed outline logo is shown below: Your final step is to paste this outline onto the image of the cat sitting in the monastery courtyard. You can use again: The first argument in indicates the image that you wish to paste in, and the third argument represents the mask. In this case, you’re using the same image as a mask because the image is a binary image. The second argument provides the top-left coordinates of the region where you want to paste the image. The watermark has a rectangular outline, which is a result of the contour filter that you used earlier. If you prefer to remove this outline, you can crop the image using . This is an exercise that you can try on your own.\n\nPillow has an extensive selection of built-in functions and filters. However, there are times when you need to go further and manipulate images beyond the features that are already available in Pillow. You can manipulate the image further with the help of NumPy. NumPy is a very popular Python library for dealing with numeric arrays, and it’s an ideal tool to use with Pillow. You can learn more about NumPy in NumPy Tutorial: Your First Steps Into Data Science in Python. When you convert an image into a NumPy array, you can perform any transformations that you require directly on the pixels in the array. Once you’ve completed your processing in NumPy, you can convert the array back into an object using Pillow. You need to install NumPy for this section: Now that you’ve installed NumPy, you’re ready to use Pillow and NumPy to spot the difference between two images. Using NumPy to Subtract Images From Each Other See if you can spot the differences between the following two images: This isn’t a hard one! However, you decide to cheat and write a Python program to solve the puzzle for you. You can download the image files and (image credit) from the repository accompanying this tutorial: Get Images: Click here to get access to the images that you’ll manipulate and process with Pillow. Your first step is to read the images using Pillow and convert them to NumPy arrays: Since and are objects of type , you can manipulate them using all the tools that you have available in NumPy. You can subtract one array from the other to show the pixels that differ between the two images: When you subtract an array from another one of the same size, the result is another array with the same shape as the original arrays. You can convert this array into an image using in Pillow: The result of subtracting one NumPy array from another and converting into a Pillow is the difference image shown below: The difference image only shows three regions from the original image. These regions highlight the differences between the two images. You can also see some noise surrounding the cloud and the fence, which is due to small changes in the original JPEG compression in the region surrounding these items. You can go further and create images from scratch using NumPy and Pillow. You can start by creating a grayscale image. In this example, you’ll create a simple image containing a square, but you can create more elaborate images in the same way: You create an array of size containing zeros everywhere. Next, you set the value of a set of pixels at the center of the array to . You can index NumPy arrays using both rows and columns. In this example, the first slice, , represents the rows to . The second slice, , which follows the comma, represents the columns to . You can use to convert the NumPy array into an object of type . The output from the code above is shown below: You’ve created a grayscale image containing a square. The mode of the image is inferred automatically when you use . In this case, mode is used, which corresponds to an image with 32-bit floating-point pixels. You can convert this to a simpler grayscale image with 8-bit pixels if you wish: You can also go further and create a color image. You can repeat the process above to create three images, one corresponding to the red channel, another to the green, and a final one corresponding to the blue channel: You create an object from each NumPy array and convert the images to mode , which represents grayscale. Now, you can combine these three separate images into one RGB image using : The first argument in is the mode of the image output. The second argument is a sequence with the individual single-band images. This code creates the following image: You’ve combined the separate bands into an RGB color image. In the next section, you’ll go a step further and create a GIF animation using NumPy and Pillow. In the previous section, you created a color image containing three overlapping squares of different colors. In this section, you’ll create an animation showing those three squares merging into a single white square. You’ll create several versions of the images containing three squares, and the location of the squares will vary slightly between successive images: You create an empty list called , which you’ll use to store the various images that you generate. Within the loop, you create NumPy arrays for the red, green, and blue channels, as you did in the previous section. The array containing the green layer is always the same and represents a square in the center of the image. The red square starts in a position displaced to the top-left of the center. In each successive frame, the red square moves closer to the center until it reaches the center in the final iteration of the loop. The blue square is initially shifted toward the bottom-right then moves towards the center with each iteration. Note that in this example, you’re iterating over , which means that the variable increases in steps of two. You learned earlier that you can save an object to file using . You can use the same function to save to a GIF file that includes a sequence of images. You call on the first image in the sequence, which is the first image that you stored in the list : The first argument in is the filename for the file that you want to save. The extension in the filename tells what file format it needs to output. You also include two keyword arguments in :\n• ensures that all the images in the sequence are saved, and not just the first one.\n• allows you to append the remaining images in the sequence to the GIF file. This code saves to file, and you can then open the GIF file with any image software. The GIF should loop by default, but on some systems you’ll need to add the keyword argument to to make sure the GIF loops. The animation that you get is the following one: The three squares with different colors merge into a single white square. Can you create your own animation using different shapes and different colors?"

        "document": "The most important class in the Python Imaging Library is the class, defined in the module with the same name. You can create instances of this class in several ways; either by loading images from files, processing other images, or creating images from scratch. To load an image from a file, use the function in the module: If successful, this function returns an object. You can now use instance attributes to examine the file contents: The attribute identifies the source of an image. If the image was not read from a file, it is set to None. The size attribute is a 2-tuple containing width and height (in pixels). The attribute defines the number and names of the bands in the image, and also the pixel type and depth. Common modes are “L” (luminance) for grayscale images, “RGB” for true color images, and “CMYK” for pre-press images. If the file cannot be opened, an exception is raised. Once you have an instance of the class, you can use the methods defined by this class to process and manipulate the image. For example, let’s display the image we just loaded: The standard version of is not very efficient, since it saves the image to a temporary file and calls a utility to display the image. If you don’t have an appropriate utility installed, it won’t even work. When it does work though, it is very handy for debugging and tests. The following sections provide an overview of the different functions provided in this library.\n\nThe Python Imaging Library supports a wide variety of image file formats. To read files from disk, use the function in the module. You don’t have to know the file format to open a file. The library automatically determines the format based on the contents of the file. To save a file, use the method of the class. When saving files, the name becomes important. Unless you specify the format, the library uses the filename extension to discover which file storage format to use. A second argument can be supplied to the method which explicitly specifies a file format. If you use a non-standard extension, you must always specify the format this way: It is important to note that the library doesn’t decode or load the raster data unless it really has to. When you open a file, the file header is read to determine the file format and extract things like mode, size, and other properties required to decode the file, but the rest of the file is not processed until later. This means that opening an image file is a fast operation, which is independent of the file size and compression type. Here’s a simple script to quickly identify a set of image files:\n\nThe class contains methods allowing you to manipulate regions within an image. To extract a sub-rectangle from an image, use the method. The region is defined by a 4-tuple, where coordinates are (left, upper, right, lower). The Python Imaging Library uses a coordinate system with (0, 0) in the upper left corner. Also note that coordinates refer to positions between the pixels, so the region in the above example is exactly 64x64 pixels. The region could now be processed in a certain manner and pasted back. When pasting regions back, the size of the region must match the given region exactly. In addition, the region cannot extend outside the image. However, the modes of the original image and the region do not need to match. If they don’t, the region is automatically converted before being pasted (see the section on Color transforms below for details). Or if you would like to merge two images into a wider image: For more advanced tricks, the paste method can also take a transparency mask as an optional argument. In this mask, the value 255 indicates that the pasted image is opaque in that position (that is, the pasted image should be used as is). The value 0 means that the pasted image is completely transparent. Values in-between indicate different levels of transparency. For example, pasting an RGBA image and also using it as the mask would paste the opaque portion of the image but not its transparent background. The Python Imaging Library also allows you to work with the individual bands of an multi-band image, such as an RGB image. The split method creates a set of new images, each containing one band from the original multi-band image. The merge function takes a mode and a tuple of images, and combines them into a new image. The following sample swaps the three bands of an RGB image: Note that for a single-band image, returns the image itself. To work with individual color bands, you may want to convert the image to “RGB” first.\n\nThe class contains methods to and an image. The former takes a tuple giving the new size, the latter the angle in degrees counter-clockwise. To rotate the image in 90 degree steps, you can either use the method or the method. The latter can also be used to flip an image around its horizontal or vertical axis. operations can also be performed identically with operations, provided the flag is true, to provide for the same changes to the image’s size. A more general form of image transformations can be carried out via the method. Instead of calculating the size of the new image when resizing, you can also choose to resize relative to a given size. # thumbnail() can also be used, # but will modify the image object in place\n\nThe Python Imaging Library provides a number of methods and modules that can be used to enhance images. The module contains a number of pre-defined enhancement filters that can be used with the method. The method can be used to translate the pixel values of an image (e.g. image contrast manipulation). In most cases, a function object expecting one argument can be passed to this method. Each pixel is processed according to that function: Using the above technique, you can quickly apply any simple expression to an image. You can also combine the and methods to selectively modify an image: # select regions where red is less than 100 # paste the processed band back, but only where red was < 100 Note the syntax used to create the mask: Python only evaluates the portion of a logical expression as is necessary to determine the outcome, and returns the last value examined as the result of the expression. So if the expression above is false (0), Python does not look at the second operand, and thus returns 0. Otherwise, it returns 255. For more advanced image enhancement, you can use the classes in the module. Once created from an image, an enhancement object can be used to quickly try out different settings. You can adjust contrast, brightness, color balance and sharpness in this way.\n\nThe Python Imaging Library contains some basic support for image sequences (also called animation formats). Supported sequence formats include FLI/FLC, GIF, and a few experimental formats. TIFF files can also contain more than one frame. When you open a sequence file, PIL automatically loads the first frame in the sequence. You can use the seek and tell methods to move between different frames: # skip to the second frame As seen in this example, you’ll get an exception when the sequence ends. You can create animated GIFs with Pillow, e.g. # Save the images as an animated GIF # duration of each frame in milliseconds The following class lets you use the for-statement to loop over the sequence: # ...do something to frame...\n\nAs described earlier, the function of the module is used to open an image file. In most cases, you simply pass it the filename as an argument. can be used as a context manager: If everything goes well, the result is an object. Otherwise, an exception is raised. You can use a file-like object instead of the filename. The object must implement , and methods, and be opened in binary mode. To read an image from binary data, use the class: Note that the library rewinds the file (using ) before reading the image header. In addition, seek will also be used when the image data is read (by the load method). If the image file is embedded in a larger file, such as a tar file, you can use the or modules to access it. Operations can be applied to multiple image files. For example, all PNG images in the current directory can be saved as JPEGs at reduced quality. Since images can also be opened from a from the module, the example could be modified to use instead of the module.\n\nSome decoders allow you to manipulate the image while reading it from a file. This can often be used to speed up decoding when creating thumbnails (when speed is usually more important than quality) and printing to a monochrome laser printer (when only a grayscale version of the image is needed). The method manipulates an opened but not yet loaded image so it as closely as possible matches the given mode and size. This is done by reconfiguring the image decoder. This is only available for JPEG and MPO files. This prints something like: Note that the resulting image may not exactly match the requested mode and size. To make sure that the image is not larger than the given size, use the thumbnail method instead."

The resulting image may end up looking stretched or compressed, which may not be the effect you want. You can see this in the newly-created image from the code above; it looks a bit squished horizontally:\n\nIf you want to resize images and keep their aspect ratios, use\n\n’smethod instead. Liketakes a two-integer tuple argument. However, the values in the tuple represent the maximum x- and y-sizes allowed while also preserving the image’s aspect ratio.\n\nEnter the code below into a new cell and run it:\n\n, themethod does not create a newinstance. Instead, it modifies the original. That’s why the code above first makes a copy of the image.\n\nThe code above resize the image to 300 × 200 and preserves the original’s aspect ratio:\n\nAnother significant difference between the\n\nandmethods is thatenalrges an image if given parameters that are larger than the original image, whiledoesn't.\n\nFor example, given an image of size 400 × 200, a call to\n\nwill create a larger-sized image 1200 pixels wide and 600 pixels tall, along with the expected loss of sharpness. A similar call tousing the original image will not enlarge the image since themethod cannot expand an image beyond either of its original dimensions.\n\nThe rise of retrocomputing and retrogaming has created a lot of interest in old-school “pixelated” graphics. You can use a combination of\n\n’sandmethods to turn a modern, high-resolution image into a “retro” one like the one below:\n\nHere’s the code that produces this effect:\n\nThe code above takes advantage of the\n\nmethod’s optionalparameter, which specifies how to draw pixels when resizing the image. When making an image larger, the “nearest neighbor” resampling method creates a “retro” pixel effect.\n\nclass provides themethod for quick image flipping.takes the following arguments:\n\nHere’s how you would create a horizontal mirror image of the original:\n\nThe resulting image can be seen below. Notice that the puffin with the open beak is now on the left side of the photo:\n\narguments rotate the image counterclockwise 90, 180, and 270 degrees, respectively. The following rotates the image 180 degrees:\n\nTransposing an image means mirroring it along the diagonal line that runs from the top left to the bottom right, while tranversing it means mirroring it along the diagonal line running from the bottom left to the top right. This is yet another case where showing is better than telling, so let’s make the code do that.\n\nYou can rotate images with Pillow using\n\n’smethod. This takes an integer or float argument representing the degrees to rotate an image (positive for counterclockwise, negative for clockwise) and returns a newobject for the rotated image.\n\nBy default, the rotated image keeps the dimensions of the original image. This means that for angles other than multiples of 180, the image will be cut and/or padded to fit the original dimensions. Consider this code, which rotates an image 90 degrees counterclockwise:\n\nNotice that the image has been “clipped” to fit the original height, and its sides have been padded with black background (on some operating systems, the padding will be made of transparent pixels) to fit the original width.\n\nThe example below, where the original image is rotated 18 degrees counterclockwise, shows this “clipping” effect more clearly.\n\nThe resulting image is shown below:\n\nTo expand the dimensions of the rotated image to fit the entire view, you pass a second argument to\n\nNow the contents of the image will be fully visible, and the dimensions of the image will have increased to account for this:\n\n’smethod to create a new image by cropping a section from an existing one. This method takes a 4-tuple that defines the position and size of the cropped region, as shown in the method call example below:\n\nPillow’s coordinate system starts with (0, 0) in the upper left corner, with x increasing from left to right and y increasing from top to bottom:\n\nThe cropped section includes the left column and the upper row of pixels and goes up to — but doesn't include — the right column and bottom row of pixels. This is better explained with a diagram:\n\nHere’s an example that creates a new image by cropping the rectangle described below:\n\nPasting an Image onto Another Image\n\nPillow enables you to paste an image onto another one. Some example use cases where this could be useful is in the protection of publicly available images by adding watermarks on them, the branding of images by adding a company logo, and in any other case where there is a need to merge two images.\n\nclass’method pastes another image onto the current one. This is useful for protecting publicly available images by adding watermarks, branding images with a company logo, or simply creating compositions of two or more images.\n\nis unlike manymethods (but like) in that it modifies theobject in place rather than returning a new `one. Because of this, we'll first make a copy of our puffin image before performing the paste to continue with the other examples using the original.\n\nThe code above loads a new image,\n• A 2-tuple specifying the upper left corner of the pasted image,\n• a 4-tuple defining the left, upper, right, and lower pixel coordinates of the pasted image, or\n• , which simply pastes the image at the coordinates (0, 0).\n\n, and makes a copy of the puffin image. We want to paste the logo image onto the puffin image copy at the bottom right corner. The code calculates the coordinates for pasting the logo, which can be:\n\nIn this case, we’re pasting the logo using a 2-tuple coordinate:\n\nYou can see the result below:\n\n, transparent pixels are pasted as solid pixels by default. Hence the black (white on some OSs) box surrounding the logo. Most of the time, this isn't what you want. You can't have your watermark covering the underlying image's content. We would rather have transparent pixels appear as such.\n\nTo achieve this, you need to pass in an optional third argument to the\n\nmethod. This argument is anobject that acts as an opacity mask.\n\nAn opacity mask is an\n\nobject where only the alpha value is significant, while its green, red, and blue values are ignored. If a mask is provided as an optional third argument to, the method updates only the regions the mask indicated. You can use either, orimages for masks. Pasting an RGBA image and using it as the mask pastes only the opaque portion of the image — not its transparent background.\n\nThe code below provides an example of this approach:\n\nWith Pillow, you can also draw on an image using the ImageDraw module. You can draw lines, points, ellipses, rectangles, arcs, bitmaps, chords, pie slices, polygons, shapes, and text.\n\nThe code below draws a black rectangle with a fine white outline near the lower left corner of the puffin image from the previous code example. It then draws the text message “Hello, puffins!” in large white text inside the rectangle:\n\nConverting an image from color to grayscale\n\n’smethod can convert images between different pixel representations, such as the RGB (red-green-blue) format used by screens and the CMYK (cyan-magenta-yellow-black) format used in printing. Like mostmethods,returns a newobject.\n\nalso supports converting images to the(luminance) format, which is a grayscale image format. The code below converts our puffin image from color to grayscale monochrome:\n\nReducing the number of colors in an image\n\nIn addition to pixelation, another way to make an image look “retro” is to reduce the number of colors it uses to 256 or fewer. You can do this with a single call to\n\nThe code below reduces the number of colors in our puffin photo to 16, producing an effect that should remind you of 1990s computer graphics:\n\nmethod of Pillow’sclass makes it possible to split a multi-band image into individual bands, such as the R, G, and B bands from an RGB image.creates new images, each containing one band from the original image.\n\nhas an inverse function,, which merges a set of single band images into a new multi-band image.takes a mode and a tuple of images and combines them into a new image.\n\nThe code below takes the original “puffin” image, splits it into three images — one for each of the R, G, and B bands — and then merges them so that:\n\nPillow allows you to enhance an image by adjusting its contrast, color, brightness, and sharpness using classes in the\n\nHere’s code that boosts the contrast of the “puffin” image:\n\nHere’s the image after enhancing its contrast:\n\nThe code above adjusts the image contrast by a factor of 3; smaller values will produce more subtle effects. A factor of 1.0 returns a copy of the original image; lower factors produce images with lower contrast.\n\nBelow, we increase the color of the image. If we used a factor of\n\n, we would get a black and white image.\n\nBelow we make the image brighter. A factor of\n\nBelow, we make the image sharper. An enhancement factor of\n\nTo save an image, use\n\n’smethod. For example, here’s how you’d save the image from the Enhancing sharpness exercise above as a PNG file:\n\nPillow sees the file extension has been specified as\n\nand converts it to PNG before saving it to a file.\n\nTo save it as a JPEG image, use this:\n\nYou can provide a second argument to\n\nto explicitly specify a file format.will do the same thing as the previous save(). Usually, it's unnecessary to supply this second argument as Pillow will determine the file storage format to use from the filename extension, but if you're using non-standard extensions, you should always specify the format this way.\n\nIn this article, we've covered some of the more common image-processing operations in applications. Pillow is a powerful library, and we have yet to discuss everything it can do. If you want to find out more, be sure to read the documentation."
