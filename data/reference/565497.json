        "document": "A good Python developer needs a solid understanding of the Python programming language and knowledge of its data structures and language constructs to write robust and maintainable code.\n\nThe Python online test assesses knowledge of programming in the Python language and commonly used parts of the Python Standard Library. This test requires solving live coding problems in Python.\n\nA gaming company is working on a platformer game. They need a function that will compute the character's final speed, given a map and a starting speed. The terrain on which the game character moves forward is made from various pieces of land placed together. Implement the function calculate_final_speed which takes the initial speed of the character, and a list of degrees of inclination that represent the uneven terrain. The speed of the character will increase or decrease proportionally to the incline of the land, as shown in the image below: The magnitude of the angle of inclination will always be < 90°. The speed change occurs only once for each piece of land. The function should immediately return 0 as the final speed if an incline reduces the speed to 0 or below 0, which makes the character lose 1 life. For example, the below code:\n\nA turn-based strategy game has a grid with water and land. The grid contains a True value where it's water and False where it's land. The player controls a boat unit with a particular movement pattern. It can only move to fixed destinations from its current position as shown in the image below: The boat can only move in a direct path through water to the possible destinations, so a destination will become unreachable if there is land in the way. Implement the can_travel_to function, that checks whether a destination is reachable by the boat. It should return True for destinations that are reachable according to the pattern above, and False for unreachable or out of bounds destinations which are outside the grid. For example, consider the following code: gameMatrix = [ [False, True, True, False, False, False], [True, True, True, False, False, False], [True, True, True, True, True, True], [False, True, True, False, True, True], [False, True, True, True, False, True], [False, False, False, False, False, False], ] print(can_travel_to(gameMatrix, 3, 2, 2, 2)) # True, Valid move print(can_travel_to(gameMatrix, 3, 2, 3, 4)) # False, Can't travel through land print(can_travel_to(gameMatrix, 3, 2, 6, 2)) # False, Out of bounds The following image shows valid and invalid destinations when the boat is in the position (3, 2):\n\nImplement the function find_roots to find the roots of the quadratic equation: ax2 + bx + c = 0. The function should return a tuple containing roots in any order. If the equation has only one solution, the function should return that solution as both elements of the tuple. The equation will always have at least one solution. The roots of the quadratic equation can be found with the following formula: For example, find_roots(2, 10, 8) should return (-1, -4) or (-4, -1) as the roots of the equation 2x2 + 10x + 8 = 0 are -1 and -4.\n\nAs a part of the route planner, the route_exists method is used as a quick filter if the destination is reachable, before using more computationally intensive procedures for finding the optimal route. The roads on the map are rasterized and produce a matrix of boolean values - True if the road is present or False if it is not. The roads in the matrix are connected only if the road is immediately left, right, below or above it. Finish the route_exists method so that it returns True if the destination is reachable or False if it is not. The from_row and from_column parameters are the starting row and column in the map_matrix. The to_row and to_column are the destination row and column in the map_matrix. The map_matrix parameter is the above mentioned matrix produced from the map. For example, for the given rasterized map, the code below should return True since the destination is reachable:\n\nYou are working on a calculator application where users can input a mathematical expression such as: (3 + 5) * (2 - 4). To correctly evaluate this expression, the application needs to validate the expression and ensure that the parentheses are balanced. The balanced parentheses are crucial for determining the order of operations and evaluating the expression correctly. You have used an AI assistant to generate the following static function to check if the parentheses in an expression are balanced: def is_balanced(parentheses): stack = [] opening = set({'(', '[', '{'}) closing = set({')', ']', '}'}) pairs = dict({ ')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{' }) for c in parentheses: if c in opening: stack.append(c) elif c in closing: if not stack or stack[-1] != pairs[c]: return False stack.pop() return len(stack) == 0 What are correct statements for the given function?"

        "document": "Creating code is an essential part of many data professions. But creating code that functions is only half the job. The code also needs to be clear, easy to hand off, and robust to disturbances. By following a few coding guidelines in your projects, you can save yourself time restructuring your code later on and make your collaborators happy, too.\n\nHere, we explore some of the coding best practices and guidelines that can help make your code clearer and more accessible.\n\nA clear structure provides more readability to your code, making it easier to debug and share. There are several things you can do while writing your code to make the structure more clear and organized.\n\nWhen choosing names for variables and functions, it’s important to choose names that are relevant and meaningful.\n\nFor example, let’s assume you are creating a program to handle bank account information, and you need a variable to hold the account number. You may be tempted to call this variable “number” or “n”. However, those are not very informative names for someone who may be looking at your code for the first time. The name “account_number” provides much more information and can be easier to follow later in the code.\n\nFor example, imagine you find the following equation halfway through a long stretch of code. Can you tell what this equation is doing?\n\nThis may be a challenging equation to come across during a code review. Consider this alternative.\n\nWith more informative variable names, it is much less frustrating to follow the logic in a piece of code. This same concept applies to function names. A function called “name_change” is much more informative than “change”, “update”, or “nc”.\n\nThere are two generally accepted conventions for creating variable or function names: camel case and snake case. Camel case uses capital letters to separate words in a variable name. Snake case uses underscores to separate words in variables. For example, we would have the variable name “accountNumber” in camel case and “account_number” in snake case.\n\nWhich convention you use depends on your personal preference, your company’s coding standards, and the programming language you are using. However, whichever case you choose, it is important to stick with it throughout your entire project. Switching between different naming conventions looks sloppy and can be visually confusing.\n\nAn easy way to make your code more readable is to add descriptive comments throughout. Good commenting will ensure your code is decipherable by someone else. You should add comments to explain what each section of code is doing, especially any complex equations or functions. You may also want to add comments to variable definitions, to give credit to any copied code, to include a reference to source data, or to leave yourself “to do” notes within the code.\n\nWhen leaving yourself “to do” notes, consider starting the comment with “TODO”. This capitalization will stand out visually, and it is easily searchable, so you can find all the notes you left for yourself.\n\nComments are used to make the code clearer and more understandable, not to make up for badly structured code. They should be clear and consistent and enhance well-structured code blocks.\n\nWhitespace is also useful to visually format your code. Think of whitespace like paragraphs. Paragraphs help to break up large chunks of text so you can quickly scan it. Similarly, adding whitespace strategically in your code makes it easier to scan through the code to find bugs and follow what it’s doing. Consider adding space between different sections or modules.\n\nConsider the following examples:\n\nIn this first example, the text is squished together and challenging to decipher. However, by separating out the content and using comments and whitespace, we can make this section much more readable.\n\nThroughout your code, consistency is key. In some languages, you can use indentation to visually separate different sections. This can be useful to differentiate sections that work inside of loops, for example. Beware: some languages, like Python, use indentation functionally, so you may be unable to use it for visual differentiation.\n\nConsistent formatting is important as it improves readability and meets reader expectations.\n\nMany programming tasks in data professions are team efforts. Even if you spend long periods coding in solitude, that code will often be sent around to a team for review and use. This makes it imperative that communication about the code be clear within the team.\n\nWhen sending code to a teammate, it’s important to send information about the code’s purpose, proper use, and any quirks they need to consider about the code while running it. This type of communication is called documentation and should always accompany the code.\n\nThe convention is to provide this documentation within a text file called README.txt that is stored in the same folder as the main code file. However, specific teams may have different standards for documentation, such as using Notion or a Google Doc.\n\nWhat should be documented?\n\nThe documentation file should include everything someone would need to know to take over the project. There should be information about how to use the code, the code’s purpose, architecture, and design. You should include notes about what the inputs and outputs are when the code is run, as well as any quirks.\n\nIt’s also useful to add information about error detection and maintenance. Depending on your company’s coding standards, you may also include author information, project completion dates, or other information.\n\nWhen writing README files, it’s important to maintain a clear structure. Clearly label your inputs and outputs and the different sections of your document. Put the most important information for your user at the top. Anything that is critical should be labeled and made to stand out with either all caps, a series of dashes, or something else.\n\nA docstring can be useful for someone who is using your code for the first time. This is a string literal written into your code that provides information about the code. In Python, if you use the command line to find documentation on a class, method, or function, the text that is displayed is the docstring within that code.\n\nHere is an example of a docstring for a function:\n\nDocumenting your code may seem like a lot of work, especially when you already know the ins and outs of your program. But proper documentation can save tons of time when passing your code off to someone else or when revisiting an old project you haven’t worked with in a while. Here’s an article where you can read more about best practices for documenting Python code.\n\nIn addition to clarity, good code should run efficiently. You can include a few practices in your writing to ensure your code processes data efficiently.\n\nLoops are often very processor-heavy tasks. One or two loops may be unavoidable, but too many loops can quickly bog down an otherwise efficient program. By limiting the number of loops and iterations you have in your code, you can boost your code’s performance.\n\nOne way to reduce the number of loops in your code is to vectorize operations. This means performing an operation on an entire vector at once instead of going through each value one at a time.\n\nIn this example, we use a for loop to add two lists together. By vectorizing, we can remove the loop and concatenate the two lists without iterating.\n\nAnother technique for reducing loops in Python is to use list comprehensions, which you can learn more about in DataCamp’s Python list comprehension tutorial.\n\nEfficient memory management is crucial for data processing apps. Inefficient memory usage can lead to performance bottlenecks and even app crashes. To optimize memory usage, consider the following techniques:\n\nUse memory profiling tools to identify memory leaks and areas of excessive memory consumption in your code. Profilers help pinpoint the parts of your program that need optimization and allow you to focus your efforts on the most critical areas.\n\nWhen dealing with large datasets, consider serializing data to disk or using data compression. Serialization reduces memory usage by storing data in a compact format, while compression further reduces storage requirements.\n\nIf you're processing extremely large datasets that don't fit into your allotted memory, try data chunking. This involves dividing the data into smaller, manageable chunks that can be processed sequentially or in parallel. It helps avoid excessive memory usage and allows you to work with larger datasets.\n\nDataCamp has a great course on writing efficient Python code.\n\nIt is a good idea to keep performance in mind while coding. After you’ve designed and written your initial code, you should edit it to further improve performance.\n\nA process called profiling allows you to find the slowest parts of your program so you can focus your editing efforts there. Many IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) have profiling software built in that allows you to easily find the bottlenecks in your code and improve them.\n\nOnce you have identified bottlenecks, you need to find the best methods of resolving them. One technique is parallel processing. This is a technique that involves splitting a task between multiple processors on your computer or in the cloud. This can be very useful if you have thousands of calculations that need to be computed.\n\nAs your program scales, you'll likely encounter larger datasets that need to be processed efficiently. Implementing the right strategies is essential to avoid performance degradation.\n\nPartition large datasets into manageable chunks. This approach, known as data partitioning, allows you to process data in parallel and distribute the workload across multiple processing units. Additionally, it minimizes the memory requirements for processing.\n\nConsider using data compression techniques to reduce the storage and transmission overhead of large datasets. Compression libraries like zlib and Snappy can significantly decrease the size of data without compromising its integrity.\n\nDistributed database solutions like Apache Cassandra, Amazon DynamoDB, or Google Cloud Bigtable can help manage large datasets. These databases are designed to handle massive datasets and provide efficient data storage and retrieval mechanisms.\n\nSome optimization techniques also improve the readability of the code. However, other optimizations may make it harder to follow what’s going on. It’s important to balance these two goals when writing and optimizing your code.\n\nIf a technique will greatly improve the efficiency of your program, it might be worth it looking a little more convoluted. If you do this, you should be sure to document it well. On the other hand, a technique that will save you only a little bit of time may not be worth it if it makes it much harder to read.\n\nBest Practices For Version Control and Collaboration\n\nWhen writing code, a useful tool is version control software. By far the most popular version of this is Git. Git saves previous versions of your code, allowing you to make changes and always revert to an earlier version if you make a catastrophic mistake. It’s essentially a backup. Git also facilitates collaboration on a project by easily highlighting differences and resolving conflicts.\n\nCheck out our introduction to version control with Git course for more details.\n\nUsing a version control system is almost as vital as saving your work. It allows for a record of your progress, a backup of successful versions, and an easy venue to publish your work. Let’s go over the advantages of using git for independent as well as collaborative coding projects.\n\nOne way to collaborate on a project is to pass versions back and forth one at a time. In this system, each programmer essentially “checks out” the code, works on their section, and passes it on to the next programmer. This is slow and inefficient. It can also result in problems if two people accidentally work on the file at the same time, resulting in two different versions of the same code.\n\nA better solution is to use a version control system like Git. With Git, multiple programmers can work on the code simultaneously. When they push their code changes to the main repository, there is a simple process used to merge the different parts of the code so everything works together. Once merged, the newly updated code is freely available to everyone with access to the repository. This allows each programmer to work on the newest version of the code.\n\nGit also provides an easy way to initiate a code review process.\n\nWhen you are the only person working on a project, it can be tempting to skip using Git for simplicity. However, there are several compelling reasons to use Git as part of your workflow, even for independent projects.\n\nOne of the most compelling reasons to use Git on independent projects is to retain the ability to revert to an earlier version of the code if it stops performing the way you expect. For example, say you add a new analysis to a recommender system you created. The analysis seems to be working fine, but suddenly, the original recommender system starts having problems. It seems obvious that the problem is due to the new analysis, but where specifically did the problem crop up? It can be useful to have a version without the analysis to look at side by side with the new version to trace the problem.\n\nGit also allows you to easily publish your code so others can view it or use it. This is very useful for setting up a portfolio, creating open-source programs, or sending code to customers. Then, if you need to update your code for any reason, it is easy to push a new version.\n\nIf you are working on a team, you may contribute to an already established repository. However, you may need to start a repository yourself. Fortunately, platforms like GitHub and Bitbucket have very user-friendly instructions for creating a new repository.\n\nOnce established, you will need to share your repository with your collaborators, keep on top of pull requests and merges, and ensure every contributor is following similar commit rules.\n\nThere are a few terms that are useful to know when working with Git.\n\nWhen two different versions of the same code are created, this is referred to as branching.\n\nMerging is the process of resolving the differences between two or more branches to create a single version of the code.\n\nWhen a programmer wants a version of the code in a repository, they will issue a pull request. This is essentially permission to download a version of the code to work with.\n\nWhen a programmer adds a new version of the code to the repository, this is called pushing a new version. DataCamp’s Git Push/Pull tutorial explains the differences between these terms and how to use each.\n\nIf multiple contributors modify the same lines of code, Git will flag it as a merge conflict. Resolving conflicts involves manually editing the conflicting code to reconcile the changes, essentially choosing which version of that line of code to keep. After resolution, you can commit the changes and continue with the merge.\n\nMaintain a clean and informative commit history by writing clear and concise commit messages. Follow a consistent format and describe the purpose of each commit. This helps track the changes over time so everyone can understand the project's history.\n\nFor more information about Git, I highly recommend DataCamp’s Introduction to Git and GitHub Concepts courses.\n\nA code review is a fantastic way to improve your code and your programming skills. This is basically a peer review, where someone else will go through your code and provide feedback.\n\nIf you work on a team, you may have mandatory code reviews on a regular basis.\n\nHowever, even if you work alone, it is a good idea to solicit occasional code reviews to keep your code up to standard. It’s also a great way to learn new ways of doing things and to learn about security issues you may not already be familiar with.\n\nIdentifying code smells and when to refactor\n\nHave you ever opened your refrigerator and noticed a bad smell that put you on a search for what had spoiled? If so, you are familiar with using smell as an indicator of something going bad. This same idea is used in code reviews.\n\nOf course, when doing a code review, you are not literally using your nose to sniff the code. But reviewers look for indicators of something gone wrong, which are called code smells.\n\nSome problems may require a simple change to one line of code to repair. However, other problems may require you to rethink an entire section or the entire document.\n\nThese larger fixes, where you are changing the structure of the underlying code without changing the functionality of the code, are called refactoring. For example, this can be done to repair a security flaw while keeping the user experience identical.\n\nTesting your code is imperative to ensure that your code is doing what you think it should. Try testing your code with small, fictional datasets where you know what the outcome should be and check that your program gives the expected answer. If you have the time and resources, testing your code on multiple datasets that test different aspects of your program can ensure your code is working the way you expect.\n\nIf you create code that is going to be in place for a while, like a data pipeline or an app, it’s particularly important to consider error handling. Errors can occur when your data sources have changed or when your end user does something unexpected. Adding blocks of code that handle expected errors can keep your program running without crashes.\n\nTest-Driven Development (TDD) is a foundational principle in software engineering that you should incorporate into your coding projects. This approach places testing at the forefront of the development process, ensuring that every piece of code is rigorously evaluated before it's considered complete.\n\nBy adhering to TDD principles, you create a safety net of tests that not only verify the correctness of your code but also help to guide the development process itself. It’s a proactive stance on testing which results in code that is more resilient, easier to maintain, and less prone to defects.\n\nUnit tests are tests written to validate certain parts of your code. For example, you may run a unit test on a function you write to convert units from Celsius to Fahrenheit. In this unit test, you ask whether your code gets the correct answer to a specific example.\n\nPython has two libraries that are particularly useful for writing unit tests, unittest and pytest. Writing comprehensive unit tests not only boosts the reliability of your code but also serves as documentation, illustrating how different parts of your software should behave.\n\nThis is an example of a unit test for a simple function and its output.\n\nIncorporating try-except blocks into your code is a fundamental error-handling technique that can significantly enhance code robustness.\n\nThese blocks allow you to gracefully handle unexpected situations or exceptions that may arise during program execution.\n\nBy anticipating potential errors and defining how your code should react to them, you can prevent crashes and unexpected behavior, leading to a more user-friendly and reliable app. Whether it's handling file I/O errors, network connectivity issues, or input validation problems, judicious use of try-except blocks can make your code more resilient and user-friendly.\n\nYou may work on a project with some sensitive data such as health information, passwords, or personally identifying information. There are several laws in place restricting the way these types of data can be used and how they must be safeguarded. It is important to work these safeguards into your code as you create it.\n\nIn other cases, you may be working with code that is important to keep secure for nonlegal reasons, such as dealing with company secrets. When writing your code, and definitely before deploying any code, you should ensure that this data is kept secure. Below are a few coding security best practices.\n\nIt’s important to collect only the data that is absolutely necessary for your project. Avoid collecting excessive information that could be misused if your system is compromised. Additionally, you can implement data retention policies to delete data that is no longer needed.\n\nImplement robust access controls to ensure that only authorized users and processes can access sensitive data. Role-based access control can help secure sensitive data. Regularly review and audit access permissions to detect and rectify any unauthorized access.\n\nEncryption is a fundamental technique for protecting data. Use strong encryption algorithms and protocols to secure data stored in databases, on disk, and during data transmission over networks. Implement encryption libraries and APIs that are well-vetted and maintained to avoid common vulnerabilities.\n\nSecure coding practices are essential for building apps that can withstand security threats. When it comes to encryption and secure coding, consider the following recommendations:\n\nAlways validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and command injection. Input validation ensures that malicious input cannot compromise your app's security.\n\nWhen using third-party libraries or components, verify their security posture. Keep them updated to patch known vulnerabilities. Additionally, consider using security-focused libraries and frameworks that are designed to mitigate common security risks.\n\nIncorporate regular security testing into your development process. This includes conducting penetration testing, code reviews, and vulnerability assessments. Automated tools can help identify security flaws, but manual testing by security experts is highly recommended.\n\nImplement secure authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication, and robust authorization controls to ensure that users only have access to the resources they need. Avoid hardcoding credentials or sensitive information in your code or configuration files.\n\nKeeping up to date on security threats is a constantly moving target as bad actors continually update their tactics. DataCamp has an introduction to data privacy course to help you get started. Once you’ve got some fundamentals, try a security wargame like Bandit to test out your new skills.\n\nData is a dynamic field, with new technologies, languages, and libraries constantly emerging. To stay competitive and relevant in the industry, it's essential to make continued learning and growth a central part of your career. One crucial aspect of this is staying updated with coding trends and libraries.\n\nMake it a habit to allocate time for learning new concepts, languages, and tools. Subscribe to newsletters, follow tech blogs, and attend webinars or conferences relevant to your field. Explore online courses and tutorials that provide hands-on experience with the latest technologies. By staying informed, you can leverage new tools and methodologies to improve your coding skills and productivity.\n\nEngaging with the coding community and forums\n\nParticipate in coding forums like Stack Overflow, GitHub discussions, or specialized forums related to your programming languages and interests. Contribute by answering questions and sharing your knowledge. Engaging in discussions and solving real-world problems not only helps others but also reinforces your own understanding of coding concepts.\n\nLocal and virtual coding meetups and conferences provide excellent opportunities to connect with like-minded individuals, share experiences, and learn from experts. These events often feature workshops, talks, and networking sessions that can expand your knowledge and professional network. Check out this list of data conferences to get started.\n\nThe internet is a treasure trove of resources for developers seeking continuous improvement. Take advantage of online courses, tutorials, and coding challenges to hone your skills and tackle new challenges.\n\nOnline Courses offered by DataCamp provide high-quality, structured learning experiences. These courses cover a wide range of topics, from coding fundamentals to advanced topics like data science and cybersecurity. A good place to start is with general coding courses like Introduction to Python, Writing Functions in Python, and Intermediate R. You may also want to try more focused courses at an advanced level, like a course on object-oriented programming.\n\nWebsites like LeetCode, Kaggle, HackerRank, and CodeSignal offer coding challenges and competitions that allow you to practice problem-solving and algorithmic skills. Regularly participating in these challenges sharpens your coding abilities and prepares you for technical interviews. DatCamp also occasionally runs challenges, and has a wide range of practical problems and real data science projects you can use to hone your skills.\n\nConsider contributing to open-source projects. This not only allows you to work on real-world data analysis projects but also exposes you to collaborative coding practices and diverse coding styles.\n\nProgramming is more than just writing code that is functional. Your code needs to be clear, organized, efficient, and scalable, while keeping in mind quality and security. By embracing these coding best practices, you will not only create better code but also elevate your skills. Consider taking courses about software engineering principles as well as language-specific best practices guides, like those outlined in this Python best practices tutorial. In a world where precision and reliability are paramount, these coding practices serve as the guiding principles that empower data professionals to excel, innovate, and make a lasting impact."

        "document": "Finding and hiring a strong software developer is one of the biggest challenges for many companies. Therefore many companies employ coding challenges as part of their interview process to determine if developers are up to the required standard for the job.\n\nCoding challenges are a great way to test the skills and abilities of a software developer. These challenges can be used in a job interview process, or simply as activities to help software developers improve their programming skills.\n\nAs an aspiring software engineer looking for a job in the industry, you must be well-prepared to face coding challenges, which are a standard part of interview processes. In this article, we will cover 10 coding challenge tips that can help you crack the interview process. Before moving forward though, let's understand more about the coding challenge.\n\nA \"coding challenge\" is a programming assignment that tests the abilities of software engineers. Because coding is a must-have skill for a software developer, it is critical to test whether candidates can code effectively. It is basically the first phase before a technical interview. Even if you aren't looking for a job, there are a lot of programming challenges that you can take part in to improve your skills.\n\nThe ideal approach is to focus on one programming language at a time. For example, if you are learning C++, learn it from scratch. Coding challenges can be filled with a variety of questionable code, and you should be capable of debugging a program without difficulty.\n\nThis can only be accomplished by sharpening your technical skills in a specific programming language, to prepare, in this case, for a future C++ challenge. This approach will help you move quickly through more difficult problems and give you an advantage in the interview process.\n\nProgramming paradigms are basically a method to solve similar problems or perform certain tasks using programming languages. With so many programming paradigms available, it would be beneficial to learn at least one. These programming paradigms include:\n\nThe term \"imperative\" is derived from the Latin \"Impero,\" which means \"I command.\" You give the computer small tasks to complete, and it completes them one at a time and reports back.\n\nThe paradigm is made up of several statements, and the result is saved after they have all been executed. It requires you to write a set of instructions that tell the computer what to do step-by-step.\n\n{% code-block language=\"js\" %}\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main()\n\n{\n\n int sum = 0;\n\n sum += 2;\n\n sum += 4;\n\n sum += 6;\n\n sum += 8;\n\n sum += 10;\n\n sum += 12;\n\n sum += 14;\n\n sum += 16;\n\n sum += 18;\n\n sum += 20;\n\n printf(\"The sum is: %d\n\n\", sum); //prints-> The sum is 110 \n\nreturn 0;\n\n{% code-block-end %}\n\nThe order of the steps is critical in an imperative programming paradigm because a specific step will have different consequences depending on the current values of variables when it is executed.\n\nThere are different types of programming paradigms\n\nProcedural programming allows for the division of instructions into smaller procedures. The procedural paradigm approach shown below helps you find the sum of the first ten natural numbers to demonstrate:\n\n{% code-block language=\"js\" %} #include <stdio.h>\n\nint main()\n\n{\n\n int sum = 0;\n\n int i =0;\n\n for(i=1;i<111;i++){\n\n sum += i;\n\n }\n\n printf(\"The sum is: %d\n\n\", sum); //prints-> The sum is 110\n\n return 0; {% code-block-end %}\n\nBecause of its unique advantages, such as code modularity and the ability to directly associate real-world business problems in terms of code, OOP is the most popular programming paradigm with key features like Class, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.\n\n{% code-block language=\"js\" %}\n\npublic class Main\n\n{\n\n public static void main(String[] args) {\n\n Addition obj = new Addition();\n\n obj.num = 20;\n\n int answer = obj.addValues();\n\n System.out.println(\"The sum is = \"+answer); //prints-> The sum is 110\n\n }\n\n}\n\nclass Addition {\n\n int sum =0;\n\n int num =0;\n\n int addValues(){\n\n for(int i=1; i<=num;i++){\n\n sum += i;\n\n }\n\n return sum;\n\n }\n\n} {% code-block-end %}\n\nParallel processing is the division of program instructions among multiple processors. A parallel processing system divides up multiple processors to run a program in less time. Languages that support the parallel processing strategy include C/C++ and NESL.\n\nThe main distinction here is that the imperative paradigm tells you how to do something, whereas declarative paradigm tells you what to do. In this type of programming, the paradigm programmer defines what the program must accomplish without specifying how it must be implemented. In other words, the approach focuses on what needs to be accomplished rather than how to accomplish it. There are two types of declarative programming paradigms.\n\nThe logic programming paradigm approaches problem-solving declaratively. It is founded on formal logic. The logic programming paradigm is made up of facts and clauses rather than instructions. It uses everything it knows to create a world where all of those facts and clauses are true. The emphasis in logical programming is on the problem and the knowledge base.\n\n{% code-block language=\"js\" %}\n\nsum of two number in prolog:\n\n predicates\n\n sumoftwonumber(integer, integer)\n\nclauses\n\n sum(0, 0).\n\n sum(n, r):-\n\n n1=n-1,\n\n sum(n1, r1),\n\n r=r1+n {% code-block-end %}\n\nThis paradigm supports languages like Absys, Prolog, ALF, Ciao, and Alice.\n\nThe functional programming paradigm has mathematical roots and is language agnostic. The execution of a series of mathematical functions is the fundamental principle of this paradigm. You put together a program of short functions. Every line of the code is contained within a function. The function's variables are all scoped.\n\nIn the functional programming paradigm, functions do not modify any values outside their scope, and they are not affected by any values outside their scope. This paradigm supports languages like Racket, JavaScript, Haskell, Scala, Clojure, and OCaml.\n\nThis programming methodology is built around data and how it moves. Rather than hard-coding a series of steps, program statements are defined by data. A database program will beat the heart of any business information system, providing file creation, data entry, update, query, and reporting functions. Several programming languages have been developed primarily for database applications. As an example, consider SQL. It is used to filter, transform, aggregate (data such as computing statistics), or call other programs on structured data streams. As a result, it has a wide range of applications.\n\nProgramming paradigms reduce programme complexity. When writing code, every programmer must use a paradigm based approach.\n\nTip #3 Get to Know Data Structures\n\nData structures and algorithms are the heart of programming. Data structures act as the foundation for all programming languages. You can improve your programming logic for a programming language if you understand its data structure. You should start with the language's data structures if you want to learn how to work with it.\n\nThe most common data structures include Heap, Graph, Tree, HashMap, Stack, Linked List, Array, and Queue. On the other hand, the most common algorithm types include two pointers, sorting, bit manipulation, string manipulation, dynamic programming, and backtracking.\n\nSome of these may appear difficult at first, but if you want to land an interview at one of the top tech firms, you should devote more time to what you find difficult and master each of these.\n\nThere are some problems that have more than one solution. So, it is essential to learn how to reach the best solution to solve a specific problem. When looking at an algorithm, you should consider time and space complexity.\n\nThe time complexity of an algorithm is a measure of how long it takes an algorithm to run as a function of the input length. It's worth noting that the time it takes to run is determined by the length of the input rather than the system’s actual execution time.\n\nTo determine the time complexity of an algorithm, it is assumed that one operation takes a constant time C, and the total operations for an input length on N are then calculated.\n\nConsider the following scenario to understand the computation process better: Assume you are trying to figure out if a pair (X, Y) occurs in an array A of N elements with a sum of Z. The simplest approach is to look at each pair and see if it meets the provided criteria.\n\nThe pseudo-code is as follows:\n\nAn algorithm's space complexity measures how much space it takes to run as a function of the length of the input. Consider the following scenario: the problem of determining the frequency of array elements.\n\nThe pseudo-code is as follows:\n\n‍Tip #5 Look at Other People’s Code\n\nReviewing other programmers' code helps you understand the format, design patterns, styling, and naming conventions consistency throughout the code. For that, you can find and explore the online communities of programmers like Stash, GitHub, Codeacademy Forums, and Bitbucket.\n\nWhen you take part in code review platforms like GitHub and Stash, you need a pull request. This means the original programmer will add you as a reviewer, and when you finish your code review, the website will track all changes you make. You could also be conducting an internal code review at work, either in person or through a version control system that your company has implemented.\n\n‍Tip #6 Plan your Strategy to Deal with the Coding Challenge\n\nMany learners often jump right into the project without a proper strategy and plan. This is one of the most common mistakes. Experienced developers make sure to have a strategy and a comprehensive project plan. In order to plan your strategy, you need to consider the following things.\n\nAlways start by deciding what project you want to work on. There are numerous suggestions suitable for various ability levels available on the internet. Because you'll be investing a lot of time and effort into this project, make sure it's something that stimulates and pleases you. If you have a project concept that displays your uniqueness, don't be scared to overlook common project subjects!\n\nLook online for other people who have worked on similar tasks after you've come up with an idea. Many programmers post their work on the internet in order to get feedback and influence others. There are innumerable projects to examine, particularly in the open-source community.\n\nYou can upload your project after each phase to see what your peers have to say about how to improve it. The online community is eager to assist students such as you! It's not a bad idea to obtain a second opinion to see where you can improve.\n\nStep 3: Choose the tools and your language.\n\nAnother step is to choose the language and tools you'll use to develop your project. Choose a language to learn if you wish to learn more than one. If you're undecided about language, think about what kind of language would be most beneficial to the project. The following are the languages you can choose from.\n• For Data Visualization: C#, R, Python, and Java\n\nTo write your code, you will also need a text editor. The most popular text editors are Notepad++, Sublime Text, and Vim. Choose an editor with auto-complete tools, FTP integration, find and replace functions, folder management systems, and syntax highlighting.\n\nStep 4: Map the architecture of the project\n\nYou can make the architecture of your project with sticky notes, or digitally so you can move around the pieces without any hassle. After that, connect each feature with a line. After creating your flowchart, you now need to write different inputs. Follow each input through the program to see which points it contacts as it moves through it. Make a list of them. Create the features needed to handle an unsupported input if you locate one.\n\nPseudocode is a plain-language explanation of an algorithm's steps. In other words, your pseudocode is a step-by-step method for resolving the coding challenge.\n\nStart with completing the most crucial features first, and then go step-by-step.\n\nThere is a popular saying, \"Rome wasn't built in a day,\" so don't expect to arrive at the solution immediately. If you rush, things will start falling apart, and you will get stuck. Make sure to understand the problem first and then start solving it step-by-step. If you don't understand the problem, you can't solve it.\n\nMany people start coding without having prior knowledge and understanding of it and often get stuck. So, in order to solve any coding problem, it is important to correctly understand exactly what it is first.\n\nWhen you understand the coding problem, write it down on a piece of paper and start solving it. Remember, code, syntax, and efficiency aren't important right now, so don't think about them just yet. If you think you can’t solve the problem, make sure to keep trying until you arrive at a solution.\n\n“Practice makes improvement.” This phrase stands true in coding as well. The more code problems you solve, the more proficient you become. Make sure to start with simpler problems and work your way up to more complex ones.\n\nYou can also go back to the problems you've already solved and tackle them in a new, or similar way. Remember that everything takes time, so don't be too hard on yourself if you can't solve a problem right away!\n\n‍Blind is an app for anonymous communication between professionals around the world, including software developers. It's a community of almost 3 million experts that share industry-specific advice and their honest feedback about the companies they work at - their salaries, interview processes, promotions, and perks. Many of them work for FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet's Google) and other industry giants. Everything is anonymous, so if you're seeking professional advice regarding coding challenges, this app is a good source of information. You can even find information on the level of complexity, the time allocated, and the number of tasks - that other candidates are welcome to share.\n\nA coding challenge helps employers to select the best candidates for the next stage of the interview process. Also called the 'zero stage' of the interview, a coding challenge is a quick and easy way to see if the candidate is the right fit from the start. The coding challenges will help evaluate both coding techniques (things you already know) and engineering capabilities (things you potentially are capable of). So go ahead and check the discussions on Blind.\n\nThis book by Gayle Laakmann McDowell includes around 200 programming problems and solutions that can be useful during coding interviews. The book also includes soft skills question examples and \"behind the scenes\" insights into how top firms hire developers.\n\nThe book's author has extensive experience as a software engineer with tech behemoths such as Microsoft, Apple, and Google. She's also interviewed over 700 individuals for software engineer posts, so she knows what she's talking about.\n\nWhich are the Most Popular Programming Challenge Websites?\n\nWriting code is also all about coming up with solutions. To be good at anything, you need to have enough practice to master the skill.\n\nCode challenge websites help you do that. Solving coding problems is a great way to improve your skills as you learn to code.\n\nProgramming challenges and puzzles can help you improve your problem-solving skills, and learning how to better use a programming language will give you more chances to get better jobs.\n\nThe following are the most popular programming challenge websites that help you sharpen your coding skills.\n\n‍HackerRank is one of the most popular websites to practice coding. When using HackerRank you should know that:\n• Developers say programming challenges on HackerRank are generally better than on other platforms, which means they're more out of the ordinary.\n• HackerRank has a great interface (but don't base your decision on UI only).\n• HackerRank offers live competitions that can better simulate a 'real-life interview'.\n• HackerRank is better for beginners and students that would like to master a new language.\n• HackerRank allows developers to apply for open positions at companies using their score on HackerRank which can be easily accessed online.\n\nIf you can find the company you're applying for in the LeetCode Premium section, subscribe and practice there. If the company you're applying for is not as big as FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet's Google), then go with HackerRank coding challenges. Either way, focus on one platform at a time.\n\nLeetCode's technical interview platform is a great place to start practicing with coding challenges to help you improve your skills before the real thing. Their platform offers approximately 200 challenges, in 14 programming languages. Besides its large number of challenges, we also like that after completing a challenge, you can view stats - such as how fast your code ran compared to other users. There's also a section of the website dedicated to resources that can help you mock interviews with tasks considering the specifics of individual companies. LeetCode's Premium version can be really helpful if you have the budget for it. For $35/month, you can unlock a section where you can review specific interview questions for companies like Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon. These questions were generously provided by a community of developers that have already landed their dream jobs and want to give back.\n\nThere are also more benefits, apart from Premium Subscriptions, to practicing coding challenges with LeetCode:\n• Developers prefer LeetCode for their straightforward tasks followed by the theory (which is mostly lacking in HackerRank).\n• Specific challenges, such as SQL, are better on LeetCode than, for instance, on HackerRank. LeetCode also offers more support for specific languages, such as Go or C.\n• LeetCode lets you compare your solutions with the solutions of other challenge participants so you can find out how to optimize your code and reduce the memory it takes.\n\nSince 2014, FreeCodeCamp says that over 40,000 of its graduates have obtained IT jobs at Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Spotify, and various other organizations.\n\nThe curriculum at FreeCodeCamp includes ten areas of study, each of which takes roughly 300 hours to finish, for 3,000 hours of training.

        "document": "How to make the process easier for yourself as well as potential engineering candidates taking your assessment.\n\nThe technical interviewing process is a grueling one for the parties on both sides. If you’re a company looking for the best new engineers, there is a ton of competition from other companies trying to hire young superstar talent before you do. There’s also the issue of people not always being completely forthcoming on their resumes. How do you know the candidate you are interviewing will be a good fit? On the other hand, let’s say you’re an early career Software Engineer looking to prove that you are fit for a certain role, and that you have the problem solving skills necessary for the job. How can you demonstrate that you are the best candidate for the position?\n\nThe answer to both of these questions is usually the dreaded Coding Challenge. What this entails can vary widely from company to company and from role to role, but generally it involves some sort of test of a candidates technical ability to see how skilled they are in a certain language or framework, and to see how well they can perform a task of the company’s choosing.\n\nIn my journey to land my first job as a Software Engineer I had many of these challenges ranging from solving Data Structure & Algorithm type questions to hour-long paired programming style interviews, to even an all-week take home project. Many of them I found extremely difficult, some were designed very poorly and tested you on things not relevant to the role, and one even sent me a broken test (I won’t name names but they’re a MAJOR tech company and never even apologized for their mistake after wasting hours of my time 👎🏻).\n\nFinally, I took a challenge at the company I am at currently, Ladder, and I believe they got the process correct. The test accurately tested my abilities based on my skill level, and it reflected the work I do on a daily basis. They recently tasked me with refining their process, and creating an improved version of the code challenge I took. The process of designing a new challenge is what inspired this blog!\n\nThis may sound obvious, but it’s the first step in creating a great challenge. You need to write down all of the skills necessary for the job you are hiring for, and identify additional behavioral tendencies you’d like to assess during this challenge.\n\nFor example, you may be hiring for a Frontend development position. Let’s say your company uses a React frontend. Obviously, this coding challenge should have some sort of testing of your candidates ability to write JavaScript and to build a React based application. But you need to consider some things while designing it such as:\n\nAre you a hiring an intern or do you need a Senior level engineer?\n\nHow do these expected skillsets differ?\n\nShould these 2 different types of candidates be taking the same test or should you create separate challenges for each skill level? (Hint: you definitely should if you can)\n\nSo you’re hiring a Frontend Developer, but is it important for your candidate to also have experience working with a backend such as Node.js or Google’s Firebase?\n\nIf the frontend team never really works with your backend servers beyond some very basic interaction, there’s not reason to test their ability to interact with them on the code challenge. Anything they’ll need to learn can be picked up on the job, so just stick to the main functions of the job here.\n\nHowever, if your ‘Frontend Engineer” role is really a Full Stack Engineer with a focus on the frontend, then maybe it is important to assess their familiarity with a backend framework of some sort.\n\nYou really have to tailor your challenge to the specific role if you want to properly evaluate candidates. As a company, you should pride yourself in giving tests that set proper expectations of what it’s like to work for you. Making challenges artificially difficult in order to “weed out” candidates, or by giving them tasks they would never do on the daily job is just a lazy approach to this process and its not only unfair to candidates, but it’s unfair to you. Think of all the great candidates you’ll miss by testing them on the wrong things.\n\nOne of the traits of great companies is their ability to cut down on inefficiencies. Whether that is in the manufacturing process, the daily work life, whatever it may be, nobody likes feeling like they are wasting time. From the company’s perspective the phrase “time is money” gets thrown around a lot, but there’s a reason its so accurate. If you can eliminate any friction points in your company, you increase your chances of success greatly, and improve costs and morale.\n\nSo why should things be different for your code challenge?\n\nIf you are testing an Engineer on their ability to build an app in React, give them everything they need to just start writing the code.\n\nCreate a repo with all of the necessary packages installed, set up the bare bones of the React app, and have it linked to the backend server already. All of this stuff is trivial and if it’s not included from the start, it just adds time to the challenge without adding any value.\n\nMake the process as painless as you can while still challenging the candidate on the tasks that you can actually gain valuable insight from. You will get better results from your candidates, they will leave the challenge thinking much more positively of your company, and you will actually have a valuable piece of information on which to assess their skills.\n\nCoding challenges are incredibly stressful for the candidates, and incredibly boring for the person doing the assessment by the time they get to the 50th candidate and see the same application.\n\nIt benefits both parties to let candidates demonstrate their creativity. Rather than giving the same rigid guidelines to each test taker, give them a general direction and sit back and see how they arrive at the solution. Not only will this make the potential hire feel more creatively fulfilled, and more likely to put full effort into the challenge, but maybe it could provide a new perspective to your company. Maybe this fresh set of eyes on a certain problem provides a solution that you and your engineering team would never have thought of. Don’t be afraid to let people show off their creativity and problem solving abilities in a low pressure environment where they are not under a strict timeline.\n\nMy best piece of advice is to design these challenges as if you were on the other side of these things. Too often in this industry people are reduced to numbers, or a short list of skills and we forget that each person has varying skillsets and something unique they can contribute to your team. Don’t miss out on a great candidate because you tried to shove them into your cookie cutter formula and didn’t put in the effort to design the best possible challenge for the role."

        "document": "Improving programming skills as a beginner or intermediate developer involves a combination of practice, learning, and exposure to new challenges. Here are five effective ways:\n\nLearn by doing. Practical experience is key to solidifying programming concepts. Building projects allows you to apply what you’ve learned in a real-world context. Start with small, manageable projects like a personal website, to-do app, or a simple game. As you grow, challenge yourself with more complex projects like a full-stack application or a machine learning model etc.\n\nJust keep learning but make sure you are working on simple tasks that you can share on GitHub.\n\nDon’t just keep watching tutorials all day long.
