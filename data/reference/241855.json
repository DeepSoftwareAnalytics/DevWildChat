        "document": "Node.js developers often have to dynamically generate HTML documents from the server side and send them to connected web app users. For example, a generic MVC web app displays the logged user’s name within the header section by dynamically constructing the header section HTML within the Node.js server. We can generate HTML documents using native HTML syntax and JavaScript with simple string concatenation, JavaScript template literals, or string replacement-based templating logic. However, these approaches become time-consuming and complex as the project complexity grows.\n\nTemplate engines offer a fully featured, pre-developed, productive solution for generating HTML documents based on templates and provided data objects. EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templating) is a popular template engine that we can use to send dynamically generated HTML documents from Node.js apps.\n\nIn this tutorial, we’ll learn EJS templating syntax, basic examples, and how to properly set up and use EJS templating in your Node.js apps. We’ll also explore advanced EJS templating techniques, best practices, and common development pitfalls, and compare EJS with other popular templating engines.\n\nEditor’s note — This blog was updated on 11 March, 2025, many thanks to the contributions of Shalitha Suranga. The revised post improves clarity with a more comprehensive introduction to EJS, detailed installation instructions, and expanded code examples. It also includes a comparison with other templating engines, a troubleshooting section, and answers to common reader questions. These updates make it an even more practical guide for developers working with EJS.\n• Template — Contains the static document structure, templating syntax, and static content\n• Data — Contents that the template engine uses to replace template syntax\n\nUnderstand the underlying process of a template engine using the following diagram:\n\nWeb template engines, like EJS, handle the task of interpolating data into HTML code while providing some features like repetitive blocks, nested blocks, shared templates that would have been difficult to implement by concatenating strings, or similar built-in JavaScript features.\n\nEJS is a web template engine that lets you generate HTML documents by embedding JavaScript code snippets within HTML code. EJS takes an HTML template written using EJS syntax and data as input parameters and renders the final HTML document by injecting data based on template logic.\n\nThe EJS web template engine comes with the following highlighted features:\n• Uses JavaScript as the templating language, so developers don’t have to learn a new language to get started\n• Allows developers to store templates in a standalone template files. The EJS engine handles files like PHP handles files to generate HTML documents dynamically\n• Works effectively with popular web frameworks like Express, and Fastify without requiring additional setup and advanced configuration\n• Comes with a fully-featured CLI that helps developers write automation scripts to generate HTML documents using templates and data files\n\nEJS is a popular web template engine that most Node.js developers integrate with their favorite web frameworks to build complex, MVC, server-rendered web apps.\n\nWe typically use EJS with web frameworks like Express and Fastify, but it’s possible to use EJS for templating requirements without a specific web framework. Let’s understand how EJS works by using it without a web framework.\n\nCreate a new Node.js project by using NPM or Yarn as follows:\n\nAdd the following code snippet to the file:\n\nThe method generates output based on the input template string and data. Here, the template uses the tag to render each data object property and we passed the required data properties from the second parameter of the method. EJS uses JavaScript as the templating language so expressions like directly get executed.\n\nWhen you run the file with Node.js, you’ll see the generated output on the terminal, as shown in the following preview:\n\nYou can also store the template content within a file named and use the method as follows:\n\nWe’ll learn how to use files in a web framework in an upcoming section soon!\n\nYou have just seen the basic syntax of EJS. The syntax used the following pattern and follows basic HTML-like syntax:\n\nFor example, previously we used the block to render the value of the data element. EJS has different tags for different purposes. The start tag is called the “HTML-escaped output” tag because if the string in the content has forbidden characters like and , the characters will be escaped (replaced by HTML codes) in the output string.\n\nHow to set up EJS in a Node.js application using Express\n\nEarlier, we wrote a sample templating example without using a web framework to simplify the introduction of this tutorial. Using a Node.js web framework undoubtedly boosts developer productivity and fastens feature delivery for building Node.js web apps, so let’s focus on using EJS under a web framework from now on.\n\nWe will use Express in this tutorial because it’s one of the best Node frameworks. It’s minimalistic and easy to get started with.\n\nLet’s start a project from scratch. Create a new directory where you want to put the project files.\n\nInitialize a new Node.js project in the directory by running or in the terminal, then to install Express and EJS, run:\n\nAfter installation, create a file and a directory in the root project directory. Inside the directory, create two directories — and . I will be explaining why we need these directories shortly.\n\nFirst, copy the following into :\n\nNow, inside the directory, create a file called . And the following into :\n\nIf you run on the terminal from the project directory, and then visit , you should see the following result:\n\nNow, let’s walk through some parts of the code and understand what is going on:\n• is self-explanatory. We are setting EJS as the Express app view engine. By default, Express will look inside of a directory when resolving the template files, which is why we had to create a directory\n• In , we are calling the method on the response object. This renders the view provided ( in this case) and sends back the rendered HTML string to the client\n• We didn’t have to provide the file extension because Express resolves it automatically; it knows the view engine we are using from . We also didn’t have to write the path as because the directory is used by default\n\nRecall that our aim is to combine data with templates. We can do that by passing a second argument to . This second argument must be an object, whose properties will be accessible in the EJS template file.\n\nThe above endpoint renders the template by passing the user details object via the property name, so we can now use the object identifier within the template to access available properties of the details object.\n\nUpdate too as follows:\n\nRun and you should get this:\n\nUsing JavaScript if statements in EJS\n\nThe EJS scriptlet tag, can contain view layer logic to render HTML content dynamically based on the provided data elements. Any JavaScript syntax can be used in this tag. You can use JavaScript statements to render HTML segments conditionally.\n\nTo see this in action, update the user details object in as follows:\n\nIf you run the app, you will see the paragraph in the statement displayed, as shown in the following preview:\n\nChange in the user details object, and the HTML block won’t be displayed.\n\nTake note of the syntax of the scriptlet . The opening is added within the second scriptlet block and the closing is added in the next scriptlet block. EJS scriptlet tags work the same as PHP tags.\n\nBecause the scriptlet tag can contain any valid JavaScript code, we can easily loop through and display data in EJS using JavaScript loop structures. You can use any preferred JavaScript loop structure with EJS by wrapping repetitive segments with a scriptlet block.\n\nCreate a new endpoint named and pass a list of sample articles into its template by adding the following code snippet to the :\n\nCreate a new file inside the named and add the following code:\n\nHere we used the JavaScript loop structure, but you can use the array method also based on your development preferences:\n\nWhen you run the app, visit and you should see the following:\n• We passed which is an array of article objects containing a and a to the template. Then, in the template, we loop through the array using ( or ) to render each post object as an HTML list item\n• The EJS engine repetitively runs the nested block since the parent scriptlet tag has a loop structure\n• The variable that references each item of the array on each iteration of the loop ( ) is accessible in the nested block of the template code until we reach the closing brackets,\n\nTry to use other JavaScript loop structures to render this article list.\n\nSome parts of websites stay the same across different pages, like the header, footer, and sidebar. If we repetitively add these parts in each page template, your project becomes hard to maintain since you’ll have to edit multiple templates to edit something in a common frontend section, i.e., adding a new link to the website’s primary navigation bar. EJS lets you create shared templates and import them with the inbuilt function.\n\nRecall that we created the directory earlier. Create two new files named and in this folder.\n\nThe content of should be the following:\n\nWe have included a link to Bootstrap in because we will be using Bootstrap classes to style the sample project.\n\nNow, update like so:\n\nAnd the following code to the file:\n• We’ve included the and partials using the function that takes the relative path to the file as an argument. Because and are in the same directory, to access from , we have to first go out of the directory using the template file path as\n• We used the HTML-unescaped output tag ( ) instead of the escaped output tag since we needed to render the HTML code of the shared template directly. Make sure not to use the HTML-unescaped output tag with untrusted user inputs, because it can expose your application to script injection attacks\n\nRun , visit and you should see this:\n\nNow we can reuse these EJS partials on other pages and avoid writing repetitive code segments. Include the partials within the file as follows:\n\nClick on the “Home” link. You’ll see the homepage with the same header and footer we’ve used for the articles page:\n\nNote that we can use any JavaScript operator in the EJS tags so that we can write this instead:\n\nSomething is wrong on the index page. Can you see it?\n\nThe title of the homepage is “Articles,” because the partial has the title of the web page hard coded as such, which is not desirable. We want the title of the page to reflect the content of the page, so we must pass in the title as an argument.\n\nEJS makes it easy because a partial has access to every variable in the parent view, so we just have to pass the variable in the object alongside the call to .\n\nUpdate the call to in as follows:\n\nThen update the title tag in :\n\nRun the app again and each page should have the correct title:\n\nYou can also pass a variable to a partial when you include it as follows:\n\nVariables passed this way precede variables passed through Express’s function.\n\nI intentionally didn’t implement the About page. Create the About page by passing some data to the to be more familiar with EJS partials and data passing.\n\nEJS uses JavaScript as the templating language, so it directly throws JavaScript exceptions and displays them within the terminal and website frontend. Here are some common EJS templating errors and how to resolve them:\n\nEJS throws a when you try to use a data property that is not provided by the function. This error can be fixed by sending the data element you used in the template or by checking whether the identifier is available as follows:\n\nEJS throws a if we try to read the properties of undefined identifiers. For example, if we try to access within the template but the object doesn’t contain the nested object, EJS throws this error.\n\nUsing JavaScript’s optional chaining operator is a popular way to solve these issues:\n\nMost developers know the possibility of printing HTML codes on the browser viewport by escaping HTML-specific characters. EJS renders HTML-escaped outputs with the tag, so if we use it to include a template, the raw code of the included template gets HTML-escaped, rendering visible HTML code on the browser viewport.\n\nTo solve this, check whether you use as follows:\n\nReplace with to render HTML-unescaped output to send raw HTML to the browser properly:\n\nis a general error type that JavaScript interpreters use to report language syntax issues, so EJS throws it for JavaScript-related syntax issues. Fixing JavaScript syntax issues is the only way to solve this issue. For example, the above error is thrown due to a missing curly brace of an statement, so closing the block properly resolves this issue:\n\nYou can use the ejs-lint NPM package or EJS code editor plugins to detect EJS syntax issues during development.\n\nAdhering to development best practices is the most practical way to create high-quality, maintainable, and beginner-friendly codebases. Consider adhering to the following best practices while developing EJS templates:\n• \n• Aim for simple, self-explanatory EJS templates by not writing complex JavaScript expressions within EJS output tags. You can either write the complex logic within the Express controller or a JavaScript function within the template\n• Effectively decompose your website into partials based on reusability requirements. Try not to create too many atomic parts or large parts that are difficult to maintain\n• Don’t assemble HTML blocks with so many output tags — use a few scriptlet tags and display HTML blocks conditionally to improve code readability, i.e., using one is better than using so many blocks\n• JavaScript errors prevent generating the final website page, so write JavaScript code within the EJS template by carefully inspecting available identifiers. Send all required data properly to the view and add conditional checks for optional data elements\n• Never create security vulnerabilities in your app from EJS templates using the tag with user inputs. Sanitize HTML strings properly if you need to render user input data as raw HTML\n\nApart from these EJS-specific best practices, write clean, readable, and error-free JavaScript code to improve the quality of JavaScript expressions in EJS templates.\n\nEJS has two main competitors: Pug and Handlebars. Both these EJS alternatives competitively offer features that EJS implements. Let’s check how EJS tries to offer a better templating solution by comparing it with Pug and Handlebars:\n\nEJS doesn’t implement template composition, but developers can use partials to decompose complex apps into reusable parts using the same technique that PHP developers use. Overall, EJS offers a simple and powerful templating solution by integrating native JavaScript with HTML using ASP-like tags.\n\nIn this article, we explored template engines, introduced EJS for Node.js app templating, and learned how to use it. We have seen how to reuse code with partials and how we can also pass data to them. Adhere to EJS templating best practices discussed above to write highly readable, maintainable, and beginner-friendly template source codes.\n\nHere is the EJS syntax reference if you want to learn more about what’s possible with EJS.

Locals represent server-side data that is accessible to your view—locals are not actually included in the compiled HTML unless you explicitly reference them using special syntax provided by your view engine.\n\nUsing locals in your views\n\nThe notation for accessing locals varies between view engines. In EJS, you use special template markup (e.g. ) to include locals in your views.\n\nThere are three kinds of template tags in EJS:\n• None\n• HTML-escapes the local, and then includes it as a string.\n• None\n• Includes the local verbatim, without escaping it.\n• Be careful! This tag can make you vulnerable to XSS attacks if you don't know what you're doing.\n• None\n• Runs the JavaScript inside the when the view is compiled.\n• Useful for conditionals ( / ), and looping over data ( / ).\n\nHere's an example of a view ( ) using two locals, and :\n\nIf the data you wanted to pass down to this view was completely static, you wouldn't necessarily need a controller. Instead, you could hard-code the view and its locals in your file, like so:\n\nMore likely, though, this data will be dynamic. In this scenario, we'd need to use a controller action to load the data from our models, then pass it to the view using the res.view() method.\n\nAssuming we hooked up our route to one of our controller's actions (and our models were set up), we might send down our view like this:\n\nIt is often desirable to “bootstrap” data onto a page so that it’s available via Javascript as soon as the page loads, rather than having to fetch the data in a separate AJAX or socket request. Sites like Twitter and GitHub rely heavily on this approach in order to optimize page load times and provide an improved user experience.\n\nHistorically, this problem was commonly solved using hidden form fields or by hand-rolling code that injected server-side locals directly into a client-side script tag. While effective, these techniques can present challenges when some of the data to be bootstrapped is from an untrusted source that might contain HTML tags and Javascript code meant to compromise your app with an XSS attack. To prevent situations like this, Sails provides a built-in view partial called that you can use to securely inject data from your view locals for access from client-side JavaScript.\n\nTo use , simply call it from within your view using the non-escaping syntax for your template language. For example, using the default EJS view engine:\n\nBy default, this exposes all of your view locals as the global variable. For example, if your action code contained:\n\nthen using as shown above would cause the locals to be safely bootstrapped in such a way that would contain the array , and would contain the string without causing that code to actually be executed on the page.\n\nThe function has a single parameter that can be used to configure what data is outputted, and how. The parameter is a dictionary that can contain the following properties:"

You'll likely want to use the raw output tag ( ) with your include to avoid double-escaping the HTML output. EJS ships with a full-featured command-line interface. Options are similar to those used in JavaScript code:\n• Write the rendered output to FILE rather than stdout.\n• Must be JSON-formatted. Use parsed input from FILE as data for rendering.\n• Must be JSON-formatted and URI-encoded. Use parsed input from STRING as data for rendering.\n• Use CHARACTER with angle brackets for open/close (defaults to %).\n• Use CHARACTER instead of left angle bracket to open.\n• Use CHARACTER instead of right angle bracket to close.\n• When set to `true`, generated function is in strict mode\n• Use 'locals' object for vars rather than using `with` (implies --strict).\n• Name to use for the object storing local variables when not using `with`. Custom delimiters can be applied on a per-template basis, or globally: let ejs = require('ejs'), users = ['geddy', 'neil', 'alex']; // Just one template ejs.render('<?= users.join(\" | \"); ?>', {users: users}, {delimiter: '?'}); // => 'geddy | neil | alex' // Or globally ejs.delimiter = '$'; ejs.render('<$= users.join(\" | \"); $>', {users: users}); // => 'geddy | neil | alex' EJS ships with a basic in-process cache for caching the intermediate JavaScript functions used to render templates. It's easy to plug in LRU caching using Node's `lru-cache` library: If you want to clear the EJS cache, call . If you're using the LRU cache and need a different limit, simple reset `ejs.cache` to a new instance of the LRU. The default file loader is , if you want to customize it, you can set .

Alternately, you can compile it yourself by cloning the repository and running (or if jake is not installed globally). Include one of these files on your page, and should be available globally Most of EJS will work as expected; however, there are a few things to note:\n• Obviously, since you do not have access to the filesystem, `ejs.renderFile` won't work.\n• For the same reason, includes do not work unless you use an include callback.

        "document": "Server-side rendering means using a server to generate HTML files. This generation/rendering of HTML files is in response to a URL request to the server. Server-side, unlike client-side rendering, utilizes JavaScript modules to render HTML instead of the browser and DOM element. This article will examine how we can achieve server-side rendering using an Express server and EJS for templating.\n\nEJS is a JavaScript templating language for generating HTML with plain JavaScript. In addition, it provides support for writing JavaScript alongside HTML by utilizing unique tags.\n\nA template language is a language that allows you to create placeholders that we can substitute for different values within our code. Templating with EJS provides a simple syntax that is easy to understand and aids fast development time. Also, EJS allows you to divide your HTML into sub-templates that can be reused and included in different templates.\n\nTo get started, we will need to create an express application; to do this, you must have Node.js installed. (You can download Node.js here if you do not already have it.) After this, create a new folder, \"express-ejs,\" and run the command below in the newly created folder.\n\nThe command will create the new node environment we will need for development. Following this, we will install all required dependencies.\n\nThe code block above will install the Express framework and EJS templating engine.\n\nIn this section, we will set up the Express server. First, create an app.js file and views folder.\n\nThe is an Express middleware that allows you to parse requests sent with a JSON payload. We will also specify the folder to serve static files using middleware; this accepts the directory for the static files as a parameter.\n\nThe code block above also creates a new Express application that sets up the template engine. In Express, indicate the directory where the template files exist; in this case, we will pass the views folder as the second parameter. Once you specify , Express will load the template engine module internally.\n\nFollowing this, we will update the package.json to the code below:\n\nIn the project folder, create a file with the following code:\n\nThe code block above will create a new Express server that listens for connections between the specified host and port.\n\nAfter bootstrapping the Express server, we will work on the template engine in the views folder. We will first set up the header and footer as partials; these are sub-templates you would like to reuse across other templates.\n\nIn the views folder, create a partials folder with two files; header.ejs and footer.ejs . Partials are added to other files using include; this accepts the file path as a value. The usage for include is demonstrated below:\n\nThe next step will be to set up the pages for the application and serve them from the Express application. First, we will create an index.ejs file with the following code:\n\nIn the code block above, we added the header and footer using include in the file and the information we want for the home page. Next, we will serve the index.ejs page from the Express app:\n\nFrom the code block above, we have a method that responds to GET requests on the \"/\" route. Within the method, we render the index file as a response by calling the method; this accepts two parameters: the file's name to render and the data to pass to the file. To test this, we will run in the terminal. Visit http://localhost:4400/ on your web browser; you should see the index.ejs page rendered.\n\nFollowing the previous section, we will look at how to use the data passed to the EJS template. In the views folder, create a posts.ejs file with the following code:\n\nThe template above expects the \"posts\" variable to exist in the data injected on a template render. Using the EJS template tags, we will loop through posts passed to the template and render the HTML file for each post data. In the Express app, we will add the code block below the GET method for the index route to render the posts.ejs file:\n\nFrom the code block above, we will render the posts.ejs file with the posts variable passed to the template. We can preview the posts page by visiting http://localhost:4400/posts .\n\nNext, we will set up a dynamic page that renders individual posts. But, first, we will create a post.ejs file with the code:\n\nThe code block will accept a data object with the keys title and body. Using EJS tags, we will display the value of the keys in the HTML. Finally, we will add the code block in the app.js to render the post page:\n\nIn the GET method, we have an id parameter passed to the request URL. We will use the id parameter to find the needed post from the posts variable and pass it to the post.ejs template. We can test this by visiting http://localhost:4400/post/1 , 1 being the id for the post we want to fetch.\n\nThe method is used to catch all requests that do not match the routes before it; this is why it is after all declared routes. We are using the method to catch all requests to routes that do not exist on our server and return a 404 error.\n\nThis article reviewed how to use EJS templates to create reusable partials and leverage the templates when rendering pages from an Express server. We also covered how to create dynamic pages using an Express server. If you want to learn more about EJS and Express, you can find visit the official documents at https://ejs.co/#docs and http://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html .\n\nUsing the information from this article, I recommend that you try building a simple blog using Express and EJS.

        "document": "jQuery UI 1.8 has been out for a while now (see details on their blog) but I've yet to really find the time to play around with it. This weekend I finally took a look at it, specifically the new autocomplete widget, and I thought I'd whip up a few quick examples showing the control being used with ColdFusion. \n\n\n\nTo begin, I recommend taking a look at, and reading some of the docs, for the autocomplete widget. I'm only going to demonstrate a few aspects of it and the docs will give you the whole story. As with most things jQueryUIish (not a word, I know), you use the widget by simply pointing the library at a DOM item and \"enabling\" it. So for example, once I've got my libraries loaded, I can turn an input control into an autosuggest with one line of code. Obviously I can, and probably will, use more code to get fine grained control over the widget, but it really is pretty simple to use.\n\nLet's start with a super simple example. This one is taken directly from the docs. The only thing I'll point out is - and this bugs me about all the jQuery UI demos, I'm going to show you the full source behind the code. It really bugs me that their View Source content never shows the included JavaScript and CSS commands. Yes, it is implied, but I know I had a hard time with this when I first began to use jQuery UI. When it comes to docs, I think it's always safe to assume less. Ok, mini rant aside. Here is a simple example of a static autocomplete. jQuery UI's autocomplete widget allows for both static, inline auto suggests as well as Ajax loaded content. We'll be looking at an example of that later on.\n\nAs you can see, we begin with our includes. We grab the core jQuery library, the jQuery UI library, and the style sheet. For my demos, I've chosen the Vader theme for obvious reasons.\n\nMy JavaScript consists of only two real parts. I've got a hard coded list of values in an array. Next, I \"enable\" the autocomplete on a input control (identified by the ID tags) and tell it to source by my array. And that's it. I really love how easy jQuery UI makes things sometimes. You can test this online here. Now let's make this a tiny bit dynamic. In my first ColdFusion version, I'll switch my categories to a ColdFusion variable. (And yes, this is still a static variable, but you can easily imagine it being sourced by the database.) The first difference here is the cats variable. Again, this would normally come from the database but for now it's just a hard coded set of strings. Going down a bit, take a look at how I translate it to JavaScript. I make use of toScript, a ColdFusion function that translates variables into their relevant JavaScript versions. I first turn the list into an array however. After that, everything else is pretty much the same. You can take a look at this here. (And while there, do a View Source to see how the toScript generated my JavaScript.) Ok, so while hard coded (or static) variables work, and are ok for small lists, most of the time you will want to load in the data via an Ajax call. The autosuggest widget makes that darn easy. If the value of the source attribute is a string, then jQuery treats it like a URL. In this example, I've pointed my source to a CFC: Notice that I pass in my method and returnformat. You need to remember that CFCs, by default, return WDDX. Luckily it is easy to get around that (in ColdFusion 8 and higher). The docs did not make it clear, but the name of the argument sent to your server is term. Here is the simple CFC I used. component { remote function searchCategories(string term) { var q = new com.adobe.coldfusion.query(); q.setDatasource(\"cfartgallery\"); q.setSQL(\"select mediatype from media where mediatype like :search\"); q.addParam(name=\"search\",value=\"%#arguments.term#%\",cfsqltype=\"cf_sql_varchar\"); var result = q.execute().getResult(); return listToArray(valueList(result.mediatype)); } As you can see, this is nothing more than a simple query. Notice my search string is dynamic on both sides of the term value. This allows me to handle partial matches, so a search for Cold would match both ColdFusion and Ice Cold Baby. If you want to match only results that begin with a term, you simply change how your server side logic works. You can demo this here. The search is against the media table of the cfartgallery demo, so try terms like \"Pa\" to see a few results. Ok, so the final demo is pretty cool I think. One of the issues most autocomplete widgets suffer from is that while humans like to work with strings (like \"Beer\"), the database prefers unique identifiers (like 13). So given that you may return a string, again, \"Beer\", when you post your form to the server, how do you handle knowing that the value \"Beer\" referred to row 13 in your database? Typically you need to do another database query. Not a big huge deal, but wouldn't it be nice if your autocomplete could work with both strings and numbers? jQuery UI's autocomplete does this and does it well! Let's begin by modifying our CFC. component { remote function searchCategories(string term) { var q = new com.adobe.coldfusion.query(); q.setDatasource(\"cfartgallery\"); q.setSQL(\"select mediaid as id, mediatype as value from media where mediatype like :search\"); q.addParam(name=\"search\",value=\"%#arguments.term#%\",cfsqltype=\"cf_sql_varchar\"); var query = q.execute().getResult(); var result = []; for(var i=1; i<=query.recordCount; i++) { result[arrayLen(result)+1] = {}; result[arrayLen(result)][\"id\"] = query.id[i]; result[arrayLen(result)][\"value\"] = query.value[i]; } return result; } In this example I've changed from returning an array of strings to returning an array of structs. Notice that I've got an ID and VALUE key being returned. (*) These values will be recognized by the widget, specifically the value attribute. By itself this won't solve our problem, but we can use the \"select\" option to handle the user selection event: This code says - when the user selects an item, grab the ID value and set it to the catid DOM item's value. Let's look at the complete page so it makes more sense. As you can see, I've added the select handler to my widget constructor. I've also added the hidden form field catid. Finally I added a real submit button and a cfdump so I can see the result. Now when I select a media type, the user will see the nice string, and the hidden form field gets the proper primary key. You can see this for yourself here. All in all I think it works really nicely. Again - please note there is more to this control then what I've shown here. Check the docs and have fun with it! (And if you are using it in production, please feel free to share the URL here.) * Did you notice I used struct notation [\"id\"] instead of dot notation? Dot notation creates JSON with upper case keys. jQuery UI won't pick up on that automatically. By using bracket notation I ensure my JSON maintains the same case."
