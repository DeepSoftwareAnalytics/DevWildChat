        "document": "IPC-2581, also known as IPC-DPMX, or Digital Product Model Exchange, is one of the \"Application Characteristic Data\" standards in the IPC 25XX Series of Data Exchange Standards of the IPC standards in the electronics industry. It is a new layered neutral data format with superior manufacturability, quality, reliability, and consistency for data information transmission between a PCB designer, a manufacturing and assembly facility. It is developed by a group of standards developers, tool developers, CAD users, and CAM users.\n\nThe standard is now being promoted by the IPC-2581 Consortium, with an independent website www.ipc2581.com. An updated version, the IPC-2581C, has been released in December 2020. The new version introduced even more groundbreaking new features.\n\nHowever, before we discuss the features and benefits of this standard and why we need it, we need to understand the shortcomings of the existing data format, i.e. the inherent limitations of the RS-274X Gerber format:\n\n\n\n● A separate physical file is required for each layer of PCB information, such as manufacturing records and assembly layers, etc.\n\n● Drill information (usually in the format of the N.C.drill file) needs to be sent separately.\n\n● Layer stackup definition needs to be presented in the form of diagrams, text, or filenames and agreed upon with the manufacturer.\n\n● The netlist used for testing (which contains the electrical connections between components) also needs to be sent separately.\n\n● The pick-and-place file with component placement information and the BOM procurement file are also made separately, which often tends to cause errors.\n\n\n\nCompared with other standards, the IPC-2581 standard uses a single XML-based file that consolidates a richer set of board manufacturing data. Including:\n\n\n\n● PCB Copper Foil Etching Information\n\n● Layer stackup information including both rigid and flexible layer\n\n● The netlist for PCB testing\n\n● BOM for procurement and assembly\n\n● Manufacturing and assembly precautions and parameters\n\n\n\nWe can open an XML file and see the following content:\n\n\n\n<IPC-2581> : Title of the standard\n\n<Content : The content filed\n\n<FunctionMode /> Function mode\n\n<StepRef /> Name of the stack \n\n<LayerRef /> Name of the layer\n\n<BomRef /> Name of the BOM \n\n...\n\n</Content> End of the content field\n\n<HistoryRecord Historical information\n\n<Bom The Bill of Material field\n\n<Ecad The ECAD field\n\nThe ECAD field is usually the main part of the file, which includes more field information, such as\n\n<CadData CAD data\n\n<Package Package\n\n< LogicalNet Net name\n\n, etc.\n\n\n\nIt can be seen that documents based on an XML format have additional advantages:\n\n\n\n● Integrity: All data can be exported from EDA tools using one format.\n\n● Security: No intermediate data conversion, and support selective output, such as sending only manufacturing data to the PCB manufacturer.\n\n● Smarter: The XML-based format provides intelligent calculation and recognition, eliminates human errors while providing an information base for intelligent data in industrial automation.\n\n● More open: The Consortium membership gives the benefit to be free from patent restrictions, with continued updates and expansion of manufacturer software and EDA software support. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, IPC-2581 was created with the combination of GenCAM and ODB++. Although Gerber has introduced Gerber X2 to make up for some of the deficiencies found in the older version, it can't be done overnight due to downward compatibility with older data and devices.\n\n\n\nIPC-2581, as one of the underlying standards of the entire IPC Standards Tree, has a more rigorous hierarchical structure and can align perfectly with other IPC standards, providing a natural tool and means for PCB manufacturing and assembly companies to comply with the IPC standards.\n\n\n\nIPC-2518C also supports automation supporting Industry 4.0, and bidirectional DFX intelligence capability, which addresses the collaboration issue of DFM. It also reduces the communication barriers and information omissions between various players such as clients, designers, PCB manufacturers, and PCB assembly factories, greatly improving work efficiency and reducing costs.\n\nNexPCB is actively investigating the support and application of IPC-2581 and will launch IPC-2581 support services when the time is ripe. We believe every reputable electronics manufacturer should do the same\n\nIf you would like to know the latest developments in the IPC2581 and\n\nhow to work with this new model, sign up for our blog now.\n\nWith every change comes a backlash, but in the case of IPC2581, the general consensus tends to be optimistic, given the past difficulty in communication with the older standards. Do you think the new IPC standards will help us move towards a more hands-free manufacturing workflow, or is it adding unneeded complexity to the older model? Let us know in the comments!"

Download the Design for Manufacturing Handbook.\n\nIn the current method of stack-up exchange, CAM engineers manually create Gerber and ODB++ files for individual layers, solder masks, and silkscreen. The stack-up details are exported in separate fab drawings. These details are then exported as separate text files, requiring manufacturers to import and decode the information from ASCII code.\n\nOn the other hand, IPC-2581 streamlines the communication between designers and manufacturers by providing a standardized format for stack-up information exchange.\n• Stack-up status is indicated with enumerations such as:\n\nGerber files require over 30 files to define different manufacturing aspects. The data, commonly encoded in ASCII, conveys critical information required for printed circuit board fabrication. However, these files can also use different formats, like EBCDIC, EIA, or ISO codes, for compatibility with various systems.\n\nOn the other hand, the ODB++, exported in .tgz, .tar, .gz, .zip, or .tar extensions, is a complex and large file with multiple data layers.\n\nIPC-2581, in contrast, adopts a neutral XML-based format that consolidates all design and manufacturing information into a single file.\n\nIts unified approach simplifies data exchange and improves overall design and manufacturing workflow efficiency.\n• Top and bottom assembly layers with precise component attributes, positioning, and footprint markings\n\nThe re-engineering process for Gerber and ODB++ files presents challenges due to their primary focus on manufacturing data, which excludes crucial details such as netlist and BOM.\n\nVariations in file format across different software tools often result in compatibility issues, which require manual interpretation and data conversion. The iterative documentation and electronic communication channels further contribute to the complexity of the re-engineering task.\n\nWhen we talk about the open standard IPC-2581, it ensures consistent interpretation across diverse software tools.\n• Includes valuable component details like values, datasheets, and BOM references, eliminating the need for external searches and manual data gathering.\n• None Allows you to upload external references (photos, URLs, and videos) to express the right design intent.\n• None Supports version control, allowing you to track changes and revert to previous versions.\n• None Replaces error-prone e-paper-based communication with efficient electronic bi-directional communication, reducing time and improving collaboration and efficiency.\n\nFor FAQs on IPC-DPMX, see IPC-2581 questions answered by consortium members.\n\nAdopting the smart design data format as part of your workflow can lead to smoother collaboration, quicker turnaround times, and improved communication with manufacturers."

        "document": "Whether you work in electronics design, manufacturing, or even defense, the alphabet soup of standards organizations is extensive and may seem daunting. The IPC standards are among the most widely accepted and important standards for PCB design and manufacturing. IPC standards will influence how a designer creates their board and how they will prepare it for production in different industries. These standards are meant to ensure performance and reliability and are accepted by several industries.\n\nAlthough the IPC standards are vital for ensuring design performance, reliability, and quality, they are not the only standards that matter for all industries. Other important standards organizations that influence PCB design include ASME, ANSI, IEC, MIL-PRF, and other specialty standards for specific products. No matter which standards matter for your design, the best PCB design software can help you comply with your standards by encoding design requirements as design rules.\n\nALTIUM DESIGNER®\n\n The only unified PCB design suite with design and verification features that can be tailored to IPC standards\n\nAmong the many electronics standards organizations, the organization that all designers should be aware of is IPC. These industry standards are designed to ensure the reliability and manufacturability of printed circuits and other electronic assemblies. The goal of the IPC standards is to ensure that electronic products are reliable, safe, and manufacturable. No matter which industry vertical or market segment you work in, IPC likely defines standards that specify important requirements for your products.\n\nVery few people have ever read the entirety of the IPC standards simply due to their breadth and depth. If you are a PCB designer, there are some very important standards with which you should become familiar. When you use the right design software with integrated compliance tools, it may be easier than you think to comply with IPC standards and design for different IPC product classes. Altium Designer’s integrated design rule engine lets you define important IPC standards as design constraints, which helps you comply with these important standards.\n\nThe IPC standards include multiple manufacturing requirements for all aspects of a printed circuit board. These manufacturing requirements ultimately translate back to design requirements, and designers need PCB design software to help ensure their boards will be compliant with IPC design requirements. Some examples include via and microvia manufacturing, solder joint strength requirements, solder mask material, and thickness, material properties for substrates, and several other manufacturing requirements.\n\nWhat IPC Sections are Relevant to PCB Design and Manufacturing?\n\nThere are many sections of the IPC standards, and not all sections apply to every circuit board design. In addition, each standard is a very long document that includes a range of requirements for designers, manufacturers, or both. Some of the important IPC design standards include:\n• IPC 2221: Establishes some generic design and performance requirements in PCBs and other forms of component mounting or interconnecting structures.\n• IPC 4101: Defines material requirements for PCB laminate materials and other materials used to build stackups.\n• IPC 2152: A newer standard that defines current carrying requirements in copper traces and planes in several different applications.\n• IPC 4761: Covers design guidelines via protection to ensure reliability, manufacturability, and quality.\n• IPC 6012: Defines generic performance requirements as compiled from IPC 2221, IPC 4101, and other quality requirements. The related IPC 6013 standard applies the same ideas to flex circuit boards.\n• IPC-A-600 series: Defines acceptance metrics for printed circuit boards, as well as the three standard IPC Classes for various printed circuit board assemblies.\n• IPC 7351: Specifies footprint and land pattern requirements for SMT components. Component manufacturers use these specifications when designing their land patterns to ensure solderability and reliable electrical connections.\n• IPC-1752A: Material Declaration Management standard defines reporting formats for data exchanged between designers, distributors, and manufacturers.\n\nMany other standards affect the design, manufacture, and qualification of printed circuit boards, but not all of these are critical for PCB designers. The important design requirements from the list above will largely affect things like clearances, testing requirements, feature sizing, mechanical design requirements, and protection requirements to ensure high quality.\n\nThe important point to understand in your design software is to encode these requirements into your design rules so you can quickly evaluate your physical layout before you prepare for fabrication and assembly. The best PCB design tools will take these requirements directly from your design rules and instantly evaluate your board in any application.\n• In some designs, such as HDI circuit boards, you’ll need to use vias with tented vias or VIPPO in your landing patterns. Learn more about designing via protection under the IPC-4761 standard.\n• The IPC-2152 standard defines the recommended relationship between trace width and current capacity for different copper weights in your traces. Learn more about IPC 2152 and designing the appropriate trace width.\n• IPC-7351 defines standards on land patterns for component footprints, and component designers should pay attention to these standards to ensure manufacturability on circuit boards. See how you can create IPC-compliant footprint models in Altium Designer.\n\nYou can design an IPC-7351-compliant component footprint in Altium Designer.\n\nWhat Do PCB Designers Need to Know About IPC Classes?\n\nThe IPC standards define four product classifications. Class 1 defines requirements for general printed circuit boards with a limited life and simple functions. These boards are meant for one-time use or throwaway products. Class 2 defines design requirements for electronic products that require extended service life and on-demand performance. These boards tend to have more complicated functions than would be found in simple devices and are often part of a larger system, such as a computer or television.\n\nClass 3 PCBs have tighter in-manufacturing tolerances and more stringent reliability requirements as opposed to Class 1 and Class 2 boards. Someone who is not a professional designer is likely designing a Class 1 circuit board. More complex products tend to be built to Class 2 or Class 3. IPC Class 3/A takes the Class 3 reliability requirements and applies them to military and/or aerospace electronic products. Other important standards organizations for military products include ISO, MIL, FAA, and SAE.\n\nTo get a more thorough view of IPC standard requirements as they apply to PCB manufacturing, you can view the IPC manufacturer’s checklist.\n\nProducts defined as Class 3 must be built according to criteria including plating thickness, laminate/solder mask selection, PCB manufacturing processes, material qualifications, and quality inspection. The major differences between Class 2 and Class 3 are in the component placement requirements for SMT components. Class 3 places stricter cleanliness requirements on the assemblies, defines a definite plating thickness in through-hole vias, and plating thickness on the surface of PCBs.\n\nTeardrops are used in IPC Class 3 PCBs as a method to prevent breakout where traces meet vias.\n\nPCB designers need to address all these fabrication requirements during the design phase. Addressing these issues as you design will prevent a redesign once you send your board to your manufacturer. Following important IPC standards on design and fabrication also helps ensure you have the highest possible board yield.\n• Every product contains defects, but these defects should be minor enough that your board will not have major problems during fabrication. Learn more about appropriate tolerances in different IPC class products.\n• The IPC-6012E standards on annular rings for Class 3 products are designed to ensure your vias have the appropriate mechanical strength to withstand thermal expansion during operation. Learn about designing annular rings on vias to comply with IPC 6012E for Class 3 products.\n• Design data for an IPC product class will need to be exported into standard manufacturing file formats. The IPC-2581 is one popular vendor-neutral file format. Learn more about PCB production file formats, including the IPC-2581 file format.\n\nVia design is an important aspect of reliability in different IPC class products.\n\nMuch like other industries, major electronics companies have collaborated to define a range of standards governing electronics design, fabrication, assembly, and testing. Some of these industry standards are more stringent and go far beyond the IPC standards for PCB design. Some of these other groups of standards include:\n• International Standards Organization (ISO): This set of standards largely covers manufacturing and quality control, but it also extends requirements to specific products and industries (e.g., ISO 13485 for medical devices.\n• International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC): A safety and performance standards organization that stresses international cooperation on electrical and electronics standards.\n• American Society of Mechanical Engineers: A general set of design and reliability standards that can apply to any electronics assembly, particularly in electromechanical systems.\n• Military Performance Specification (MIL-PRF): These standards apply mechanical performance requirements and reliability standards to electronics for military equipment and defense systems.\n• Military Standard (MIL-STD): A broad set of standards that defines a range of requirements on military hardware. This includes testing requirements for military electronics.\n\nThe design standards specified directly and indirectly by these organizations can be encoded as design rules in Altium Designer, just like your other important IPC standards for PCB design. It is up to you as a designer to determine which standards are most important for your product. Altium Designer includes all the design tools you need to ensure your physical layout will comply with any of these design requirements, thanks to its integrated underlying design engine.\n\nAltium Designer Helps You Comply With Any PCB Design Standards\n\nAltium Designer’s online DRC engine ensures your PCB layout adheres to design rules as you work. Continuously checking features against standard and customized design rules, helps maintain compliance with IPC standards while streamlining circuit board creation. These verification tools enhance design accuracy and ensure high-quality PCB performance.\n• Altium Designer’s complete set of design tools is built on a rules-driven design engine. This allows you to define IPC standards for PCB design and different IPC classes as design rules and constraints. Your layout will be automatically checked against your design rules as you create your board.

        "document": "At PCB West 2022, we had a chance to converse with Hemant Shah, the chairman of the IPC-2581 consortium, about the benefits of IPC-2581 revision C to designers and manufacturers. Watch the video to find out more.\n\nCan you discuss IPC-2581’s bidirectional DFX intelligence new feature?\n\nHemant Shah: IPC-2581 revision C, which came out in 2020, has a new capability that is very unique and powerful. It allows you to do a DFM exchange (DFX) with your CM. When you hand off your design to your manufacturer, typically they will come back with some technical queries, exceptions, or errors. They share those DFM errors back to you in either a spreadsheet, email, PowerPoint, or a combination of these.\n\nWith 2581, the manufacturer can produce a DFM exchange module that can go into the design. You can load that query into the ECAD tool. Now, all the questions are in the context of your design. You can cross-verify the query/DFM error with respect to your design at the same time (in a single file). You can also respond to the queries through IPC-2581 using the ECAD tool. After all the modifications, you can send the data back in the same format.\n\nThis iteration can happen multiple times. What’s important is that all data of these multiple communications are stored in one file. You can look at what went on after your board fabrication is done. It is an archive that can be data mined over a period of time to see if you are repeating the same errors and save time by avoiding them. Your CM can also do the same data mining.\n\nWhat else is new with IPC 2581 revision C?\n\nHemant Shah: Revision C was a big overhaul of the standard. One of the major things we have revised is the rigid-flex support. Rev B supported rigid-flex, but revision C makes it more robust and complete. Similarly, we have added more component support, so you can represent screen-down components, embedded components, wire bond components, and so on. For impedance specification, you don’t need a table at all. You have the complete flexibility and diversity to represent the impedance in your design. Therefore, exporting the unified IPC-2581 file using EDA tools can take care of all your design and build intent.\n\nAdditionally, we’ve got content related to point support (test points), side plating, and net shorting. If you have an RF circuit or a circuit that has an intentional short between two signals, it can now be specified through 2581. Eliminating the need for yet another file that you had to hand off to the manufacturer mentioning two intentionally shorted nets. So, there are a lot of new things in IPC-2581 revision C.\n• Bidirectional DFX is electronic rather than paper-based or electronic paper-based.\n• You eliminate additional instructions required for net shorts, edge/slide plating, and embedded components. Now, you can just add it to your design and then transfer that data to your manufacturer. So that’s the benefit of that.\n\nHow does IPC-2581 revision C benefit the manufacturer?\n\nHemant Shah: Manufacturers right now have to deal with multiple design files. 2581 was complete, but there were certain things that were not included. With the new inclusions in revision C, the fabricators don’t have to go back to the customer, asking for additional data, or don’t have to manage multiple files. IPC-2581 benefits both designers and CM. Bidirectional DFX is another benefit. The manufacturers don’t have to produce some other form of communication that the user may not understand.\n\nWhat role does IPC-2581 play in the PCB fabrication and assembly smart factory strategy?\n\nHemant Shah: IPC-2581 has also been linked to IPC CFX (connected factory exchange). This enables an efficient way to pass the design data to the manufacturers that can be used in Industry 4.0 (the latest version of IPC CFX).\n\n2581 is also included in the IPC digital standard 2551. This is important for manufacturers because it models the factory floor. It can simulate how the PCB will be manufactured on a particular line or multiple lines using the design data. Manufacturers can choose a particular line that will be more optimum to produce a specific layout. Alternatively, they can send feedback on efficiency to the designers. For instance, a slight change like moving a component further away from the edge of the board may optimize a particular line and get your product out faster.\n\nHemant Shah specializes in developing and marketing innovative software solutions for electronic system designers. He has 20+ years of experience in the industry managing off-shore development groups in India and Israel.\n\nNeed assistance with IPC-2581? Post your queries on our PCB forum, SierraConnect.

        "document": "Just the other day, I was cruising around town with a buddy in his fairly new car, and I couldn’t help but notice he wasn’t using the cruise control. Curious, I asked why, and he shared his skepticism about automotive automation technology. Digging a bit deeper and pulling out the owner’s manual, I found out his car also came equipped with level-one autonomous driving aids. Again, I asked, and again, the answer was the same. After some convincing, he decided to give these features a try; once he got accustomed to it, the discomfort seemed to fade away. Before long, he was singing a different tune. A few weeks later after acing a 600-mile journey with ease and arriving much fresher than anticipated, he was all praises for how these tech additions had lightened his driving workload.\n\nThis little road trip revelation got me thinking about parallels in the world of printed circuit board (PCB) design, specifically how we can “reduce workload with IPC-2581”, not just a catchy marketing phrase, but one pivotal for the industry.\n\nHistorically, PCB designers have juggled an overwhelming array of files for manufacturing, assembly, and testing. From Gerber files for each layer, drill files for each drill combination, IPC-356 for testing, placement files for assembly, and not forgetting the BOM, the file count can quickly stack up. A 4-layer board could mean managing 8 files, while a 16-layer board might see you wrestling with 20 files. Add in the need to track versions and revisions and regenerate all or some when changes are made to the PCB, and the system’s complexity becomes glaringly apparent. Despite some updates, the core process has remained largely unchanged since the 1980s, begging the question: Isn’t there a better way?\n\nThe Advent of ODB++ and The Rise of IPC-2581\n\nIn the quest for improvement, the PCB design world saw the introduction of ODB and later ODB++ in the mid-1990s. Though this innovation tackled some issues by allowing for more configurable file set creation, it didn’t completely phase out the use of Gerber/drill files. Moreover, being under Siemens’ control, ODB++ wasn’t as open as the industry would like, limiting the scope for widespread innovation. If someone has ideas for change or updates for the format, they would probably need to be a Siemens customer to get a platform to propose their ideas.\n\nEnter IPC-2581. Proposed in the early 2000s but only gaining significant traction by around 2015, IPC-2581 represents a pivotal shift towards a more inclusive and open standard. Authored by the IPC and supported by a consortium of OEMs, manufacturers, EDA companies, and willing individuals, IPC-2581 champions a collaborative approach to standard development. With the consortium open to all applicants, it offers a direct path for anyone with innovative ideas to contribute to the evolution of PCB data formats.\n\nAdopting IPC-2581 can significantly reduce our workload, much like using advanced tech made my friend’s long drive a breeze. This format simplifies the data handling process, condensing necessary information into a single XML file that’s easy to view with several free tools available on the IPC-2581 consortium’s website. Its rising adoption by manufacturers, testers, and assemblers underscores the industry’s move towards more efficient, streamlined processes.\n\nMoreover, IPC-2581 empowers us to influence the development of new technologies directly. Unlike the distant prospect of requesting features from car manufacturers, joining the IPC-2581 consortium allows us to actively participate in shaping the future of PCB design standards.\n\nZuken’s CR-8000 Design Force is on board with every method out there for crafting production outputs tailored to customer needs. But let’s cut to the chase—IPC-2581 isn’t just a method; it’s the method to streamline your production output creation. And here’s the clincher: it’s a user-driven format. That means it’s not just a tool; it’s your tool. The design community and those who use the data downstream have a say in its development. They’re not just participants; they’re the drivers of innovation. So, by using IPC-2581, you’re not just simplifying your process; you’re shaping it.\n\nJust as my friend discovered the joys and benefits of embracing new automotive technologies, the PCB design and manufacturing industry stands to gain immensely from adopting IPC-2581. By streamlining the design process and opening up avenues for direct involvement in standard development, IPC-2581 simultaneously reduces our workload and democratizes the innovation process."

        "document": "Another best practice to talk about within the digitally integrated and optimized pillar is the collaboration between design and manufacturing and how those two disciplines are exchanging data. This is often called Design for Manufacturing or DFM.\n\nWhat is Design for Manufacturing (DFM)?\n\nDesign for Manufacturing, or DFM, is the design of a PCB with the manufacturing process in mind. DFM is should be considered throughout the design flow. DFM ensures a seamless design-to-manufacturing hand-off.\n\nIn the past, what we’ve seen is that the data that we’re handing to manufacturing doesn’t address producibility or manufacturability. As we throw stuff over the fence (and I don’t mean that literally), I mean that when we hand over poor quality data, that’s not optimized, you end up running into problems, which can then lead to work stoppages because you have technical queries coming back at you indicating that there is an issue or concerns that need to be addressed in order to move forward.\n\nWhat are the roadblocks?\n\nRoadblocks could include a wide spectrum of design or manufacturing issues. Then, there is the competitive pressure on the fab shop or manufacturing to just accept the data and make their own internal changes – tweaking the design just enough to get the design at a level to move forward with the fabrication. Often, they don’t provide what they tweaked or what they adjusted in the data provided, back to engineering. This potentially prevents teams from optimizing and continuously improving their design as they produce their future designs. Instead, design teams are producing the same stuff, with the same quality or potential issues, over and over. Sadly, this is what is taking place today.\n\nData exchange should be bidirectional. By doing this, we enable lessons learned from manufacturing to be fed back to design/engineering. That bidirectional loop, or that data exchange, has to highest potential to positively influence the design. The best practice in doing this is by utilize intelligent data formats such as ODB++ and IPC-2581. These types of data formats enable intelligent communication from engineering to manufacturing or vice versa. The value we gain is an optimized, integrated bidirectional collaboration that minimizes errors during the data exchange, and it provides a continuous feedback loop of lessons learned back to design/engineering.\n\nHow it works: design and manufacturing collaboration\n\nDetailed stackup planning early in the initial design process allows you to optimize your stackup by allowing users to perform pre-layout signal integrity simulations based on the actual materials your fabricators will use.\n\nThis allows for calculating single ended or differential impedance as well as insertion loss for microstrip signals, including the ability to add in the effects of solder mask and hatched plane.\n\nAfter identifying the materials to be used in the design, you can use that information to start building the stackup using a wizard, which will walk you through the construction of a new stackup. Once complete, the stackup information can be exported and sent to the fabricator.\n\nA digital thread between design and manufacturing enables teams to minimize the respins that often happen between the design and manufacturing teams. Streamlining the transition to manufacturing requires sharing a complete understanding of the product and enabling early downstream access to the data.\n\nRunning a manufacturability analysis before sending to your manufacturer allows users to catch issues before sending their design to their manufacturer, minimizing respins and eliminating the possibility of undesired changes made to the design by manufacturing.\n\nPotential manufacturing issues are easily identified and can be viewed within the tool. A report can also be exported for use in identifying problem areas that need to be addressed in the next revision.\n\nVisit our website or watch this video to learn more about design and manufacturing collaboration."

        "document": "Designing around standards can be challenging. While working on a weather balloon project at university, I learned more about FAA regulations than I ever thought I’d care to know. While determining the physics for a proper flight was difficult and balancing a meager school budget even harder, the most intensive and exacting process was synchronizing between multiple agencies with jurisdiction over our flight path. While the rapidly rising (how ironic!) cost of helium ultimately sidelined the project, I learned a valuable lesson about the necessity of adhering to industry regulations and guidelines for safety.\n\nFor electronics and the manufacturing of printed circuit boards, it’s no different: devices must meet safety standards to avoid failing tests or later fines. The best CMs will be those well-versed in the industry standards for building circuit boards. Some of these standards include those published by IPC, the Association Connecting Electronics Industries. In these standards, designers can find detailed information on the documentation of a board’s manufacturing. Consider the IPC PCB standards a CM must use to build a circuit board and how the best CMs incorporate them into all operations.\n\n\n\n IPC PCB Standards Used in the Manufacturing of Your PCB\n\nOne of the most widely used industry standards in manufacturing printed circuit boards is IPC-A-610—Acceptability of Electronic Assemblies. This standard covers electronic assemblies handling, the acceptable methods for hardware installation on the assemblies, what constitutes acceptable soldering results, and many other aspects of manufacturing surface mount and through-hole technology circuit boards. Another standard, IPC J-STD-001G—Requirements for Soldered Electrical and Electronic Assemblies, details how to manufacture a PCB to meet the acceptability requirements of IPC-A-610.\n\nHere are some of the other IPC assembly standards a CM should be using in the manufacturing of printed circuit boards:\n• IPC-A-600—Acceptability of Printed Boards. This standard is used primarily for the incoming inspection of bare boards from a PCB fabricator.\n• IPC/WHMA-A-620C—Requirements and Acceptance for Cables and Wire Harness Assemblies. CMs use this to manufacture cables in conjunction with PCB assemblies.\n• IPC-A-630—Acceptability Standard for Manufacture, Inspection, and Testing of Electronic Enclosures. This standard is used for CM assembles and box build inspections.\n• IPC 7711/7721C—Rework, Modification, and Repair of Electronic Assemblies. To repair and rework PCBAs to IPC standards, a CM will use the information from this document.\n\nMany other IPC specifications apply to the assembly of printed circuit boards, but these are the primary ones that a CM should use to ensure board success.\n\nAccess to the IPC standards is an integral part of the process for a PCBA contract manufacturer, but simply having access to them isn’t enough. These standards are modified and updated regularly, and the best CMs will have a plan to keep their personnel fully trained with the latest information.\n\nContract manufacturers that do this may have one or more employees certified as IPC trainers (CIT). This designation allows the CM to keep their employees up-to-date with their biannual IPC certifications without spending extra time and money on a third-party trainer.\n\nAn additional benefit is that the CIT is not limited to just the CM they work for; it allows the CM to train other personnel from suppliers or customers. When all members of the PCB manufacturing process have training in these standards, everyone in the process—including the supplier, the CM, and the customer—will enjoy much better communication.\n\nHow IPC Standards Help in Every Aspect of Your CM’s Business\n\nTo succeed, a CM must do more than just focus on the specific details of the IPC PCB standards that apply to their actions. The best CMs will embrace these standards from cover to cover so that their processes build on a solid foundation. This way, they are prepared to catch minor manufacturing imperfections that would otherwise be overlooked by those merely trying to satisfy a limited set of details from the standard. Some details that can get missed include proper PCBA handling to avoid electrostatic discharge (ESD), work environment, and personnel considerations.\n\nAt VSE, we’re a team of engineers committed to building electronics for our customers, no matter how intricate. Our quality management system embraces the totality of the IPC standards; we only produce boards that adhere to the highest standards of excellence.
