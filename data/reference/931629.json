        "document": "Conditional formatting typically works the same way in a range of cells, an Excel table, or a PivotTable report. However, conditional formatting in a PivotTable report has some extra considerations:\n• There are some conditional formats that don't work with fields in the Values area of a PivotTable report. For example, you can't format such fields based on whether they contain unique or duplicate values. These restrictions are mentioned in the remaining sections of this article, where applicable.\n• If you change the layout of the PivotTable report by filtering, hiding levels, collapsing and expanding levels, or moving a field, the conditional format is maintained as long as the fields in the underlying data are not removed.\n• The scope of the conditional format for fields in the Values area can be based on the data hierarchy and is determined by all the visible children (the next lower level in a hierarchy) of a parent (the next higher level in a hierarchy) on rows for one or more columns, or columns for one or more rows. Note: In the data hierarchy, children do not inherit conditional formatting from the parent, and the parent does not inherit conditional formatting from the children.\n• There are three methods for scoping the conditional format of fields in the Values area: by selection, by corresponding field, and by value field. The default method of scoping fields in the Values area is by selection. You can change the scoping method to the corresponding field or value field by using the Apply formatting rule to option button, the New Formatting Rule dialog box, or the Edit Formatting Rule dialog box. Use this method if you want to select\n• A contiguous set of fields in the Values area, such as all of the product totals for one region.\n• A non-contiguous set of fields in the Values area, such as product totals for different regions across levels in the data hierarchy.\n• Conditionally format a set of fields in the Values area for all levels in the hierarchy of data.\n• Conditionally format a set of fields in the Values area for one level in the hierarchy of data. When you conditionally format fields in the Values area for top, bottom, above average, or below average values, the rule is based on all visible values by default. However, when you scope by corresponding field, instead of using all visible values, you can apply the conditional format for each combination of: Use Quick Analysis to apply conditional formatting in Excel Use the Quick Analysis button to apply selected conditional formatting to the selected data. The Quick Analysis button appears automatically when you select data.\n• Select the data that you want to conditionally format. The Quick Analysis button appears on the lower-right corner of the selection.\n• In the pop-up that appears, on the Formatting tab, move your mouse over the different options to see a Live Preview on your data, and then click on the formatting option you want.\n• The formatting options that appear in the Formatting tab depend on the data you have selected. If your selection contains only text, then the available options are Text, Duplicate, Unique, Equal To, and Clear. When the selection contains only numbers, or both text and numbers, then the options are Data Bars, Colors, Icon Sets, Greater, Top 10%, and Clear.\n• Live preview will only render for those formatting options that can be used on your data. For example, if your selected cells don't contain matching data and you select Duplicate, the live preview will not work.\n• If the Text that Contains dialog box appears, enter the formatting option you want to apply and click OK. If you'd like to watch a video that shows how to use Quick Analysis to apply conditional formatting, see Video: Use conditional formatting. You can download a sample workbook that contains different examples of applying conditional formatting, both with standard rules such as top and bottom, duplicates, Data Bars, Icon Sets and Color Scales, as well as manually creating rules of your own. Color scales are visual guides that help you understand data distribution and variation. A two-color scale helps you compare a range of cells by using a gradation of two colors. The shade of the color represents higher or lower values. For example, in a green and yellow color scale, as shown below, you can specify that higher value cells have a more green color and lower value cells have a more yellow color. Tip: You can sort cells that have this format by their color - just use the context menu. Tip: If any cells in the selection contain a formula that returns an error, the conditional formatting is not applied to those cells. To ensure that the conditional formatting is applied to those cells, use an IS or IFERROR function to return a value other than an error value.\n• Select one or more cells in a range, table, or PivotTable report.\n• On the Home tab, in the Styles group, click the arrow next to Conditional Formatting, and then click Color Scales.\n• Hover over the color scale icons to see which icon is a two-color scale. The top color represents higher values, and the bottom color represents lower values. You can change the method of scoping for fields in the Values area of a PivotTable report by using the Formatting Options button that appears next to a PivotTable field that has conditional formatting applied.\n• Select one or more cells in a range, table, or PivotTable report.\n• On the Home tab, in the Styles group, click the arrow next to Conditional Formatting, and then click Manage Rules. The Conditional Formatting Rules Manager dialog box appears.\n• \n• To add a completely new conditional format, click New Rule. The New Formatting Rule dialog box appears.\n• To add a new conditional format based on one that is already listed, select the rule, then click Duplicate Rule. The duplicate rule appears in the dialog box. Select the duplicate, then select Edit Rule. The Edit Formatting Rule dialog box appears.\n• To change a conditional format, do the following:\n• Make sure that the appropriate worksheet, table, or PivotTable report is selected in the Show formatting rules for list box.\n• Optionally, change the range of cells by clicking Collapse Dialog in the Applies to box to temporarily hide the dialog box, by selecting the new range of cells on the worksheet, and then by selecting Expand Dialog.\n• Select the rule, and then click Edit rule. The Edit Formatting Rule dialog box appears.\n• Under Apply Rule To, to optionally change the scope for fields in the Values area of a PivotTable report by:\n• All cells for a Value label: Click All cells showing <Value label> values.\n• All cells for a Value label, excluding subtotals and the grand total: Click All cells showing <Value label> values for <Row Label>.\n• Under Select a Rule Type, click Format all cells based on their values (default).\n• Under Edit the Rule Description, in the Format Style list box, select 2-Color Scale.\n• To select a type in the Type box for Minimum and Maximum, do one of the following:\n• Format lowest and highest values: Select Lowest Value and Highest Value. In this case, you do not enter a Minimum and MaximumValue.\n• Format a number, date, or time value: Select Number and then enter a Minimum and MaximumValue.\n• Valid values are from 0 (zero) to 100. Don't enter a percent sign. Use a percentage when you want to visualize all values proportionally because the distribution of values is proportional.\n• Format a percentile: Select Percentile and then enter a Minimum and MaximumValue. Valid percentiles are from 0 (zero) to 100. Use a percentile when you want to visualize a group of high values (such as the top 20thpercentile) in one color grade proportion and low values (such as the bottom 20th percentile) in another color grade proportion, because they represent extreme values that might skew the visualization of your data.\n• Format a formula result: Select Formula and then enter values for Minimum and Maximum.\n• The formula must return a number, date, or time value.\n• Start the formula with an equal sign (=).\n• Invalid formulas result in no formatting being applied.\n• It's a good idea to test the formula to make sure that it doesn't return an error value.\n• Make sure that the Minimum value is less than the Maximum value.\n• You can choose a different type for the Minimum and Maximum. For example, you can choose a number for Minimum a percentage for Maximum.\n• To choose a Minimum and Maximum color scale, click Color for each, and then select a color. If you want to choose additional colors or create a custom color, click More Colors. The color scale you select is shown in the Preview box. Format cells by using a three-color scale in Excel Color scales are visual guides that help you understand data distribution and variation. A three-color scale helps you compare a range of cells by using a gradation of three colors. The shade of the color represents higher, middle, or lower values. For example, in a green, yellow, and red color scale, you can specify that higher value cells have a green color, middle value cells have a yellow color, and lower value cells have a red color. Tip: You can sort cells that have this format by their color - just use the context menu.\n• Select one or more cells in a range, table, or PivotTable report.\n• On the Home tab, in the Styles group, click the arrow next to Conditional Formatting, and then click Color Scales.\n• Select a three-color scale. The top color represents higher values, the center color represents middle values, and the bottom color represents lower values. Hover over the color scale icons to see which icon is a three-color scale. You can change the method of scoping for fields in the Values area of a PivotTable report by using the Formatting Options button that appears next to a PivotTable field that has conditional formatting applied.\n• Select one or more cells in a range, table, or PivotTable report.\n• On the Home tab, in the Styles group, click the arrow next to Conditional Formatting, and then click Manage Rules. The Conditional Formatting Rules Manager dialog box appears.\n• \n• To add a new conditional format, click New Rule. The New Formatting Rule dialog box appears.\n• To add a new conditional format based on one that is already listed, select the rule, then click Duplicate Rule. The duplicate rule is copied and appears in the dialog box. Select the duplicate, then select Edit Rule.

The Edit Formatting Rule dialog box appears.\n• Under Apply Rule To, to optionally change the scope for fields in the Values area of a PivotTable report by:\n• Corresponding field: Click All <value field> cells with the same fields.\n• Value field: Click All <value field> cells.\n• Under Select a Rule Type, click Format all cells based on their values.\n• Under Edit the Rule Description, in the Format Style list box, select 3-Color Scale.\n• Select a type for Minimum, Midpoint, and Maximum. Do one of the following:\n• In this case, you do not enter a Lowest and HighestValue.\n• Format a number, date, or time value: Select Number and then enter a value for Minimum, Midpoint, and Maximum.\n• Format a percentage: Select Percent and then enter a value for Minimum, Midpoint, and Maximum. Valid values are from 0 (zero) to 100. Do not enter a percent (%) sign. Use a percentage when you want to visualize all values proportionally, because using a percentage ensures that the distribution of values is proportional.\n• Format a percentile: Select Percentile and then enter a value for Minimum, Midpoint, and Maximum. Valid percentiles are from 0 (zero) to 100. Use a percentile when you want to visualize a group of high values (such as the top 20th percentile) in one color grade proportion and low values (such as the bottom 20th percentile) in another color grade proportion, because they represent extreme values that might skew the visualization of your data.\n• Format a formula result: Select Formula and then enter a value for Minimum, Midpoint, and Maximum. The formula must return a number, date, or time value. Start the formula with an equal sign (=). Invalid formulas result in no formatting being applied. It's a good idea to test the formula to make sure that it doesn't return an error value.\n• You can set minimum, midpoint, and maximum values for the range of cells. Make sure that the value in Minimum is less than the value in Midpoint, which in turn is less than the value in Maximum.\n• You can choose a different type for Minimum, Midpoint, and Maximum. For example, you can choose a Minimum number, Midpoint percentile, and Maximum percent.\n• In many cases, the default Midpoint value of 50 percent works best, but you can adjust this to fit unique requirements.\n• To choose a Minimum, Midpoint, and Maximum color scale, click Color for each, and then select a color.\n• To choose additional colors or create a custom color, click More Colors.\n• The color scale you select is shown in the Preview box. A data bar helps you see the value of a cell relative to other cells. The length of the data bar represents the value in the cell. A longer bar represents a higher value, and a shorter bar represents a lower value. Data bars are useful in spotting higher and lower numbers, especially with large amounts of data, such as top selling and bottom selling toys in a holiday sales report. The example shown here uses data bars to highlight dramatic positive and negative values. You can format data bars so that the data bar starts in the middle of the cell, and stretches to the left for negative values. Tip: If any cells in the range contain a formula that returns an error, the conditional formatting is not applied to those cells. To ensure that the conditional formatting is applied to those cells, use an IS or IFERROR function to return a value (such as 0 or \"N/A\") instead of an error value.\n• Select one or more cells in a range, table, or PivotTable report.\n• On the Home tab, in the Style group, click the arrow next to Conditional Formatting, click Data Bars, and then select a data bar icon. You can change the method of scoping for fields in the Values area of a PivotTable report by using the Apply formatting rule to option button.\n• Select one or more cells in a range, table, or PivotTable report.\n• On the Home tab, in the Styles group, click the arrow next to Conditional Formatting, and then click Manage Rules.

The Edit Formatting Rule dialog box appears.\n• Under Apply Rule To, to optionally change the scope for fields in the Values area of a PivotTable report by:\n• Corresponding field: Click All <value field> cells with the same fields.\n• Value field: Click All <value field> cells.\n• Under Select a Rule Type, click Format all cells based on their values.\n• Under Edit the Rule Description, in the Format Style list box, select Data Bar.\n• Select a Minimum and MaximumType. Do one of the following:\n• Format lowest and highest values: Select Lowest Value and Highest Value. In this case, you do not enter a value for Minimum and Maximum.\n• Format a number, date, or time value: Select Number and then enter a Minimum and MaximumValue.\n• Format a percentage: Select Percent and then enter a value for Minimum and Maximum. Valid values are from 0 (zero) to 100. Do not enter a percent (%) sign. Use a percentage when you want to visualize all values proportionally, because using a percentage ensures that the distribution of values is proportional.\n• Format a percentile Select Percentile and then enter a value for Minimum and Maximum. Valid percentiles are from 0 (zero) to 100. Use a percentile when you want to visualize a group of high values (such as the top 20th percentile) in one data bar proportion and low values (such as the bottom 20th percentile) in another data bar proportion, because they represent extreme values that might skew the visualization of your data.\n• Format a formula result Select Formula, and then enter a value for Minimum and Maximum.\n• The formula has to return a number, date, or time value.\n• Start the formula with an equal sign (=).\n• Invalid formulas result in no formatting being applied.\n• It's a good idea to test the formula to make sure that it doesn't return an error value.\n• Make sure that the Minimum value is less than the Maximum value.\n• You can choose a different type for Minimum and Maximum. For example, you can choose a Minimum number and a Maximum percent.\n• If you want to choose additional colors or create a custom color, click More Colors. The bar color you select is shown in the Preview box.\n• To show only the data bar and not the value in the cell, select Show Bar Only.\n• To apply a solid border to data bars, select Solid Border in the Border list box and choose a color for the border.\n• To choose between a solid bar and a gradiated bar, choose Solid Fill or Gradient Fill in the Fill list box.\n• To format negative bars, click Negative Value and Axis and then, in the Negative Value and Axis Settings dialog box, choose options for the negative bar fill and border colors. You can choose position settings and a color for the axis. When you are finished selecting options, click OK.\n• You can change the direction of bars by choosing a setting in the Bar Direction list box. This is set to Context by default, but you can choose between a left-to-right and a right-to-left direction, depending on how you want to present your data. Format cells by using an icon set Use an icon set to annotate and classify data into three to five categories separated by a threshold value. Each icon represents a range of values. For example, in the 3 Arrows icon set, the green up arrow represents higher values, the yellow sideways arrow represents middle values, and the red down arrow represents lower values. Tip: You can sort cells that have this format by their icon - just use the context menu. The example shown here works with several examples of conditional formatting icon sets. You can choose to show icons only for cells that meet a condition; for example, displaying a warning icon for those cells that fall below a critical value and no icons for those that exceed it. To do this, you hide icons by selecting No Cell Icon from the icon drop-down list next to the icon when you are setting conditions. You can also create your own combination of icon sets; for example, a green \"symbol\" check mark, a yellow \"traffic light\", and a red \"flag.\" Tip: If any cells in the selection contain a formula that returns an error, the conditional formatting is not applied to those cells. To ensure that the conditional formatting is applied to those cells, use an IS or IFERROR function to return a value (such as 0 or \"N/A\") instead of an error value.\n• Select the cells that you want to conditionally format.\n• On the Home tab, in the Style group, click the arrow next to Conditional Formatting, click Icon Set, and then select an icon set. You can change the method of scoping for fields in the Values area of a PivotTable report by using the Apply formatting rule to option button.\n• Select the cells that you want to conditionally format.\n• On the Home tab, in the Styles group, click the arrow next to Conditional Formatting, and then click Manage Rules. The Conditional Formatting Rules Manager dialog box appears.\n• \n• To add a conditional format, click New Rule. The New Formatting Rule dialog box appears.\n• To add a new conditional format based on one that is already listed, select the rule, then click Duplicate Rule. The duplicate rule is copied and appears in the dialog box. Select the duplicate, then select Edit Rule. The Edit Formatting Rule dialog box appears.\n• To change a conditional format, do the following:\n• Make sure that the appropriate worksheet, table, or PivotTable report is selected in the Show formatting rules for list box.\n• Optionally, change the range of cells by clicking Collapse Dialog in the Applies to box to temporarily hide the dialog box, by selecting the new range of cells on the worksheet, and then by selecting Expand Dialog.\n• Select the rule, and then click Edit rule. The Edit Formatting Rule dialog box appears.\n• Under Apply Rule To, to optionally change the scope for fields in the Values area of a PivotTable report by:\n• Corresponding field: Click All <value field> cells with the same fields.\n• Value field: Click All <value field> cells.\n• Under Select a Rule Type, click Format all cells based on their values.\n• Under Edit the Rule Description, in the Format Style list box, select Icon Set.\n• Select an icon set. The default is 3 Traffic Lights (Unrimmed). The number of icons and the default comparison operators and threshold values for each icon can vary for each icon set.\n• You can adjust the comparison operators and threshold values. The default range of values for each icon are equal in size, but you can adjust these to fit your unique requirements. Make sure that the thresholds are in a logical sequence of highest to lowest from top to bottom.\n• \n• Valid values are from 0 (zero) to 100. Do not enter a percent (%) sign. Use a percentage when you want to visualize all values proportionally, because using a percentage ensures that the distribution of values is proportional.\n• Format a percentile: Select Percentile. Valid percentiles are from 0 (zero) to 100. Use a percentile when you want to visualize a group of high values (such as the top 20th percentile) using a particular icon and low values (such as the bottom 20th percentile) using another icon, because they represent extreme values that might skew the visualization of your data.\n• Format a formula result: Select Formula, and then enter a formula in each Value box.\n• The formula must return a number, date, or time value.\n• Start the formula with an equal sign (=).\n• Invalid formulas result in no formatting being applied.\n• It's a good idea to test the formula to make sure that it doesn't return an error value.\n• To make the first icon represent lower values and the last icon represent higher values, select Reverse Icon Order.\n• To show only the icon and not the value in the cell, select Show Icon Only.\n• You may need to adjust the column width to accommodate the icon.\n• The size of the icon shown depends on the font size that is used in that cell. As the size of the font is increased, the size of the icon increases proportionally. Format cells that contain text, number, or date or time values To more easily find specific cells, you can format them by using a comparison operator. For example, in an inventory worksheet sorted by categories, you could highlight products with fewer than 10 items on hand in yellow. Or, in a retail store summary worksheet, you might identify all stores with profits greater than 10%, sales volumes less than $100,000, and region equal to \"SouthEast.\" The examples shown here work with examples of built-in conditional formatting criteria, such as Greater Than, and Top %. This formats cities with a population greater than 2,000,000 with a green background and average high temperatures in the top 30% with orange. Note: You cannot conditionally format fields in the Values area of a PivotTable report by text or by date, only by number.\n• Select one or more cells in a range, table, or PivotTable report.\n• On the Home tab, in the Style group, click the arrow next to Conditional Formatting, and then click Highlight Cells Rules.\n• Select the command you want, such as Between, Equal To Text that Contains, or A Date Occurring.\n• Enter the values you want to use, and then select a format. You can change the method of scoping for fields in the Values area of a PivotTable report by using the Apply formatting rule to option button. If you'd like to watch videos of these techniques, see Video: Conditionally format text and Video: Conditionally format dates.\n• Select one or more cells in a range, table, or PivotTable report.\n• On the Home tab, in the Styles group, click the arrow next to Conditional Formatting, and then click Manage Rules. The Conditional Formatting Rules Manager dialog box appears.\n• \n• To add a conditional format, click New Rule.

For example, select Between and then enter 100 and 200, or select Equal to and then enter 1/1/2009. You can also enter a formula that returns a number, date, or time value.\n• If you enter a formula, start it with an equal sign (=).\n• Invalid formulas result in no formatting being applied.\n• It's a good idea to test the formula to make sure that it doesn't return an error value.\n• Format by text: Select Specific Text, choosing a comparison operator, and then enter text. For example, select Contains and then enter Silver, or select Starting with and then enter Tri. Quotes are included in the search string, and you may use wildcard characters. The maximum length of a string is 255 characters. You can also enter a formula that returns text.\n• If you enter a formula, start it with an equal sign (=).\n• Invalid formulas result in no formatting being applied.\n• It's a good idea to test the formula to make sure that it doesn't return an error value. To see a video of this technique, see Video: Conditionally format text.\n• Format by date: Select Dates Occurring and then select a date comparison. For example, select Yesterday or Next week. To see a video of this technique, see Video: Conditionally format dates.\n• Format cells with blanks or no blanks: Select Blanks or No Blanks. A blank value is a cell that contains no data and is different from a cell that contains one or more spaces (spaces are considered as text).\n• Format cells with error or no error values: Select Errors or No Errors. Error values include: #####, #VALUE!, #DIV/0!, #NAME?, #N/A, #REF!, #NUM!, and #NULL!.\n• To specify a format, click Format. The Format Cells dialog box appears.\n• Select the number, font, border, or fill format you want to apply when the cell value meets the condition, and then click OK. You can choose more than one format. The formats you select are shown in the Preview box. You can find the highest and lowest values in a range of cells that are based on a cutoff value you specify. For example, you can find the top 5 selling products in a regional report, the bottom 15% products in a customer survey, or the top 25 salaries in a department .\n• Select one or more cells in a range, table, or PivotTable report.\n• On the Home tab, in the Style group, click the arrow next to Conditional Formatting, and then click Top/Bottom Rules.\n• Select the command you want, such as Top 10 items or Bottom 10 %.\n• Enter the values you want to use, and then select a format.

By default, the conditionally format is based on all visible values. However when you scope by corresponding field, instead of using all visible values, you can apply the conditional format for each combination of:\n• A column and its parent row field, by selecting each Column group.\n• A row and its parent column field, by selecting each Row group.\n• Select the number, font, border, or fill format you want to apply when the cell value meets the condition, and then click OK. You can choose more than one format. The formats you select are displayed in the Preview box. Note: You can't conditionally format fields in the Values area of a PivotTable report by unique or duplicate values. Tip: When using the \"Duplicate Values\" formatting rule, if the \"Office authoring languages and proofing\" setting is set to a language that uses Double-byte character set (DBCS) encoding, such as Japanese, halfwidth and fullwidth characters are treated the same. If you need to differentiate between them, you can use the \"Use a formula to determine where this formula is true\" rule type with a COUNTIF formula. For example, to identify duplicate values in the range A2:A400, apply the formula \"=COUNTIF($A$2:$A$400,A2)> 1\" for conditional formatting. In the example shown here, conditional formatting is used on the Instructor column to find instructors that are teaching more than one class (duplicate instructor names are highlighted in a pale red color). Grade values that are found just once in the Grade column (unique values) are highlighted in a green color.\n• Select the cells that you want to conditionally format.\n• On the Home tab, in the Style group, click the arrow next to Conditional Formatting, and then click Highlight Cells Rules.\n• Enter the values you want to use, and then select a format.\n• Select the cells that you want to conditionally format.\n• On the Home tab, in the Styles group, click the arrow next to Conditional Formatting, and then click Manage Rules.

Set up your own conditional formatting rule If none of the above options is what you’re looking for, you can create your own conditional formatting rule in a few simple steps. Notes: If there's already a rule defined that you just want to work a bit differently, duplicate the rule and edit it.\n• Select Home > Conditional Formatting > Manage Rules, then in the Conditional Formatting Rule Manager dialog, select a listed rule and then select Duplicate Rule. The duplicate rule then appears in the list.\n• Select the cells that you want to format.\n• On the Home tab, click Conditional Formatting > New Rule.\n• Create your rule and specify its format options, then click OK. If you don't see the options that you want, you can use a formula to determine which cells to format - see the next section for steps). Use a formula to determine which cells to format If you don't see the exact options you need when you create your own conditional formatting rule, you can use a logical formula to specify the formatting criteria. For example, you may want to compare values in a selection to a result returned by a function or evaluate data in cells outside the selected range, which can be in another worksheet in the same workbook. Your formula must return True or False (1 or 0), but you can use conditional logic to string together a set of corresponding conditional formats, such as different colors for each of a small set of text values (for example, product category names). Note: You can enter cell references in a formula by selecting cells directly on a worksheet or other worksheets. Selecting cells on the worksheet inserts absolute cell references. If you want Excel to adjust the references for each cell in the selected range, use relative cell references. For more information, see Create or change a cell reference and Switch between relative, absolute, and mixed references. Tip: If any cells contain a formula that returns an error, conditional formatting is not applied to those cells. To address this, use IS functions or an IFERROR function in your formula to return a value that you specify (such as 0, or \"N/A\") instead of an error value.\n• On the Home tab, in the Styles group, click the arrow next to Conditional Formatting, and then click Manage Rules.\n• \n• To add a conditional format, click New Rule. The New Formatting Rule dialog box appears.\n• To add a new conditional format based on one that is already listed, select the rule, then click Duplicate Rule. The duplicate rule is copied and appears in the dialog box. Select the duplicate, then select Edit Rule. The Edit Formatting Rule dialog box appears.\n• To change a conditional format, do the following:\n• \n• Make sure that the appropriate worksheet, table, or PivotTable report is selected in the Show formatting rules for list box.\n• Optionally, change the range of cells by clicking Collapse Dialog in the Applies to box to temporarily hide the dialog box, by selecting the new range of cells on the worksheet or other worksheets, and then by clicking Expand Dialog.\n• Select the rule, and then click Edit rule. The Edit Formatting Rule dialog box appears.\n• Under Apply Rule To, to optionally change the scope for fields in the Values area of a PivotTable report, do the following:\n• To scope by corresponding field: Click All cells showing <Values field> values.\n• To scope by Value field: Click All cells showing <Values field> for <Row>.\n• Under Select a Rule Type, click Use a formula to determine which cells to format.\n• Under Edit the Rule Description, in the Format values where this formula is true list box, enter a formula.\n\n\n\n You have to start the formula with an equal sign (=), and the formula must return a logical value of TRUE (1) or FALSE (0).\n• Select the number, font, border, or fill format you want to apply when the cell value meets the condition, and then click OK.\n\n\n\n You can choose more than one format. The formats you select are shown in the Preview box. Example 1: Use two conditional formats with criteria that uses AND and OR tests The following example shows the use of two conditional formatting rules. If the first rule doesn't apply, the second rule applies. First rule: a home buyer has budgeted up to $75,000 as a down payment and $1,500 per month as a mortgage payment. If both the down payment and the monthly payments fit these requirements, cells B4 and B5 are formatted green. Second rule: if either the down payment or the monthly payment doesn't meet the buyer's budget, B4 and B5 are formatted red. Change some values, such as the APR, the loan term, the down payment, and the purchase amount to see what happens with the conditionally formatted cells. Example 2: Shade every other row by using the MOD and ROW functions A conditional format applied to every cell in this worksheet shades every other row in the range of cells with a blue cell color. You can select all cells in a worksheet by clicking the square above row 1 and to the left of column A. The MOD function returns a remainder after a number (the first argument) is divided by divisor (the second argument). The ROW function returns the current row number. When you divide the current row number by 2, you always get either a 0 remainder for an even number or a 1 remainder for an odd number. Because 0 is FALSE and 1 is TRUE, every odd numbered row is formatted. The rule uses this formula: =MOD(ROW(),2)=1. Note: You can enter cell references in a formula by selecting cells directly on a worksheet or other worksheets. Selecting cells on the worksheet inserts absolute cell references. If you want Excel to adjust the references for each cell in the selected range, use relative cell references. For more information, see Create or change a cell reference and Switch between relative, absolute, and mixed references. The following video shows you the basics of using formulas with conditional formatting. If you want to apply an existing formatting style to new or other data on your worksheet, you can use Format Painter to copy the conditional formatting to that data.\n• Click the cell that has the conditional formatting that you want to copy.\n• The pointer changes to a paintbrush. Tip: You can double-click Format Painter if you want to keep using the paintbrush to paste the conditional formatting in other cells.\n• To paste the conditional formatting, drag the paintbrush across the cells or ranges of cells you want to format.\n• To stop using the paintbrush, press Esc. Note: If you’ve used a formula in the rule that applies the conditional formatting, you might have to adjust any cell references in the formula after pasting the conditional format. For more information, see Switch between relative, absolute, and mixed references. If your worksheet contains conditional formatting, you can quickly locate the cells so that you can copy, change, or delete the conditional formats. Use the Go To Special command to find only cells with a specific conditional format, or to find all cells that have conditional formats. Find all cells that have a conditional format\n• Click any cell that does not have a conditional format.\n• On the Home tab, in the Editing group, click the arrow next to Find & Select, and then click Conditional Formatting. Find only cells that have the same conditional format\n• Click any cell that has the conditional format that you want to find.\n• On the Home tab, in the Editing group, click the arrow next to Find & Select, and then click Go To Special. When you use conditional formatting, you set up rules that Excel uses to determine when to apply the conditional formatting. To manage these rules, you should understand the order in which these rules are evaluated, what happens when two or more rules conflict, how copying and pasting can affect rule evaluation, how to change the order in which rules are evaluated, and when to stop rule evaluation.\n• You create, edit, delete, and view all conditional formatting rules in the workbook by using the Conditional Formatting Rules Manager dialog box. (On the Home tab, click Conditional Formatting, and then click Manage Rules.) When two or more conditional formatting rules apply, these rules are evaluated in order of precedence (top to bottom) by how they are listed in this dialog box. Here's an example that has expiration dates for ID badges. We want to mark badges that expire within 60 days but are not yet expired with a yellow background color, and expired badges with a red background color. In this example, cells with employee ID numbers who have certification dates due to expire within 60 days are formatted in yellow, and ID numbers of employees with an expired certification are formatted in red. The rules are shown in the following image. The first rule (which, if True, sets cell background color to red) tests a date value in column B against the current date (obtained by using the TODAY function in a formula). Assign the formula to the first data value in column B, which is B2. The formula for this rule is =B2<TODAY(). This formula tests the cells in column B (cells B2:B15). If the formula for any cell in column B evaluates to True, its corresponding cell in column A (for example, A5 corresponds to B5, A11 corresponds to B11), is then formatted with a red background color. After all the cells specified under Applies to are evaluated with this first rule, the second rule is tested. This formula checks if values in the B column are less than 60 days from the current date (for example, suppose today’s date is 8/11/2010). The cell in B4, 10/4/2010, is less than 60 days from today, so it evaluates as True, and is formatted with a yellow background color. The formula for this rule is =B2<TODAY()+60. Any cell that was first formatted red by the highest rule in the list is left alone. A rule higher in the list has greater precedence than a rule lower in the list. By default, new rules are always added to the top of the list and therefore have a higher precedence, so you'll want to keep an eye on their order. You can change the order of precedence by using the Move Up and Move Down arrows in the dialog box.\n• What happens when more than one conditional formatting rule evaluates to True Sometimes you have more than one conditional formatting rule that evaluates to True. Here's how rules are applied, first when rules don't conflict, and then when they do conflict: When rules don't conflict For example, if one rule formats a cell with a bold font and another rule formats the same cell with a red color, the cell is formatted with both a bold font and a red color. Because there is no conflict between the two formats, both rules are applied. When rules conflict For example, one rule sets a cell font color to red and another rule sets a cell font color to green. Because the two rules are in conflict, only one can apply. The rule that is applied is the one that is higher in precedence (higher in the list in the dialog box).\n• How pasting, filling, and the Format Painter affect conditional formatting rules While editing your worksheet, you may copy and paste cell values that have conditional formats, fill a range of cells with conditional formats, or use the Format Painter. These operations can affect conditional formatting rule precedence in the following way: a new conditional formatting rule based on the source cells is created for the destination cells. If you copy and paste cell values that have conditional formats to a worksheet opened in another instance of Excel (another Excel.exe process running at the same time on the computer), no conditional formatting rule is created in the other instance and the format is not copied to that instance.\n• What happens when a conditional format and a manual format conflict If a conditional formatting rule evaluates as True, it takes precedence over any existing manual format for the same selection. This means that if they conflict, the conditional formatting applies and the manual format does not. If you delete the conditional formatting rule, the manual formatting for the range of cells remains. Manual formatting is not listed in the Conditional Formatting Rules Manager dialog box nor is it used to determine precedence.\n• Controlling when rule evaluation stops by using the Stop If True check box For backwards compatibility, select the Stop If True check box in the Manage Rules dialog box to simulate how conditional formatting might appear in those earlier versions of Excel that do not support more than three conditional formatting rules or multiple rules applied to the same range. For example, if you have more than three conditional formatting rules for a range of cells, and are working with an earlier version of Excel, that version of Excel:\n• Evaluates only the first three rules.\n• Applies the first rule in precedence that is True.\n• Ignores rules lower in precedence if they are True. The following table summarizes each possible condition for the first three rules: Rule one is applied and rules two and three are ignored. Rule two is applied and rule three is ignored. You can select or clear the Stop If True check box to change the default behavior:\n• To evaluate only the first rule, select the Stop If True check box for the first rule.\n• To evaluate only the first and second rules, select the Stop If True check box for the second rule. You can't select or clear the Stop If True check box if the rule formats by using a data bar, color scale, or icon set. If you'd like to watch a video showing how to manage conditional formatting rules, see Video: Manage conditional formatting. Edit the order in which conditional formatting rules are evaluated The order in which conditional formatting rules are evaluated - their precedence - also reflects their relative importance: the higher a rule is on the list of conditional formatting rules, the more important it is. This means that in cases where two conditional formatting rules conflict with each other, the rule that is higher on the list is applied and the rule that is lower on the list is not applied.\n• On the Home tab, in the Styles group, click the arrow next to Conditional Formatting, and then click Manage Rules. The conditional formatting rules for the current selection are displayed, including the rule type, the format, the range of cells the rule applies to, and the Stop If True setting. If you don't see the rule that you want, in the Show formatting rules for list box, make sure that the right range of cells, worksheet, table, or PivotTable report is selected.\n• Select a rule. Only one rule can be selected at a time.\n• To move the selected rule up in precedence, click Move Up. To move the selected rule down in precedence, click Move Down.\n• Optionally, to stop rule evaluation at a specific rule, select the Stop If True check box.\n• On the Home tab, click Conditional Formatting > Clear Rules > Clear Rules from Entire Sheet. Follow these steps if you have conditional formatting in a worksheet, and you need to remove it.\n• On the Home tab, click Conditional Formatting > Clear Rules > Clear Rules from Entire Sheet.\n• Select the cells that contain the conditional formatting.\n• Click the Quick Analysis Lens button that appears to the bottom right of the selected data. Notes: Quick Analysis Lens will not be visible if:\n• All of the cells in the selected range are empty, or\n• There is an entry only in the upper-left cell of the selected range, with all of the other cells in the range being empty. Find and remove the same conditional formats throughout a worksheet\n• Click on a cell that has the conditional format that you want to remove throughout the worksheet.\n• On the Home tab, click the arrow next to Find & Select, and then click Go To Special.\n• Click Same under Data validation. to select all of the cells that contain the same conditional formatting rules.\n• On the Home tab, click Conditional Formatting > Clear Rules > Clear Rules from Selected Cells.\n\nTip: The following sections use examples so you can follow along in Excel for the web. To start, download the Conditional Formatting Examples workbook and save it to OneDrive. Then, open OneDrive in a web browser and select the downloaded file.\n• Select the cells you want to format, then select Home > Styles > Conditional Formatting > New Rule. You can also open the Conditional Formatting pane and create a new rule without first selecting a range of cells.\n• Verify or adjust the cells in Apply to range.\n• Choose a Rule Type and adjust the options to meet your needs.\n• When finished, select Done and the rule will be applied to your range.\n• Select a cell which has a conditional format you want to change. Or you can select Home > Styles > Conditional Formatting > Manage Rules to open the Conditional Formatting task pane and select an existing rule.\n• The Conditional Formatting task pane displays any rules which apply to specific cells or ranges of cells.\n• Hover over the rule and select Edit by clicking the pencil icon. This opens the task pane for rule editing.\n• Modify the rule settings and click Done to apply the changes. The Conditional Formatting task pane provides everything you need for creating, editing, and deleting rules. Use Manage Rules to open the task pane and work with all the Conditional Formatting rules in a selection or a sheet.\n• The Conditional Formatting task pane opens and displays the rules, scoped to your current selection.\n• Choose a different scope on the Manage Rules in menu - for example, choosing this sheet tells Excel to look for all rules on the current sheet.\n• Add a rule by selecting New Rule (the plus sign).\n• Delete all rules in scope by selecting Delete All Rules (the garbage can). Use a formula to determine which cells to format You can use a formula to determine how Excel evaluates and formats a cell. Open the Conditional Formatting pane and select an existing rule or create a new rule. Enter the formula in the box. You can use any formula that returns a logical value of TRUE (1) or FALSE (0), but you can use AND and OR to combine a set of logical checks. For example, =AND(B3=\"Grain\",D3<500) is true for a cell in row 3 if both B3=\"Grain\" and D3<500 are true.\n\n\n\n You can clear conditional formatting in selected cells or the entire worksheet.\n• To clear conditional formatting in selected cells, select the cells in the worksheet. Then Select Home > Styles > Conditional Formatting > Clear Rules > Clear Rules from Selected Cells.\n• To clear conditional formatting in the entire worksheet, select Home > Styles > Conditional Formatting > Clear Rules > Clear Rules from Entire Sheet.\n• To delete conditional formatting rules, select Home > Styles > Conditional Formatting >Manage Rules and use the delete (garbage can) on a specific rule or the Delete all rules button. Color scales are visual guides which help you understand data distribution and variation. Excel offers both two-color scales and three-color scales. A two-color scale helps you compare a range of cells by using a gradation of two colors. The shade of the color represents higher or lower values. For example, in a green and yellow color scale, you can specify that higher value cells be more green and lower value cells have a more yellow. A three-color scale helps you compare a range of cells by using a gradation of three colors. The shade of the color represents higher, middle, or lower values. For example, in a green, yellow, and red color scale, you can specify that higher value cells have a green color, middle value cells have a yellow color, and lower value cells have a red color. Tip: You can sort cells that have one of these formats by their color - just use the context menu.\n• Select the cells that you want to conditionally format using color scales. A data bar helps you see the value of a cell relative to other cells. The length of the data bar represents the value in the cell. A longer bar represents a higher value, and a shorter bar represents a lower value. Data bars are useful in spotting higher and lower numbers, especially with large amounts of data, such as top selling and bottom selling toys in a holiday sales report.\n• Select the cells that you want to conditionally format. Format cells by using an icon set Use an icon set to annotate and classify data into three to five categories separated by a threshold value. Each icon represents a range of values. For example, in the 3 Arrows icon set, the green up arrow represents higher values, the yellow sideways arrow represents middle values, and the red down arrow represents lower values.\n• Select the cells that you want to conditionally format. Format only cells that contain text, number, or date/time values This option lets you highlight specific cell values within a range of cells based on their specific contents. This can be especially useful when working with data sorted using a different range. For example, in an inventory worksheet sorted by categories, you could highlight the names of products where you have fewer than 10 items in stock so it's easy to see which products need restocking without resorting the data.\n• Select the cells that you want to conditionally format.\n• Select the comparison, such as Between, Equal To, Text That Contains, or A Date Occurring. You can highlight the highest and lowest values in a range of cells which are based on a specified cutoff value. Some examples of this would include highlighting the top five selling products in a regional report, the bottom 15% products in a customer survey, or the top 25 salaries in a department.\n• Select the cells that you want to conditionally format.\n• Select the command you want, such as Top 10 items or Bottom 10 %.\n• Enter the values you want to use, and select a format (fill, text, or border color). Format only values that are above or below average You can highlight values above or below an average or standard deviation in a range of cells. For example, you can find the above-average performers in an annual performance review, or locate manufactured materials that fall below two standard deviations in a quality rating.\n• Select the cells that you want to conditionally format.\n• Select the option you want, such as Above Average or Below Average.\n• Enter the values you want to use, and select a format (fill, text, or border color).\n• Select the cells that you want to conditionally format.\n• Enter the values you want to use, and select a format (fill, text, or border color). If you want to apply an existing formatting style to other cells on your worksheet, use Format Painter to copy the conditional formatting to that data.\n• Click the cell that has the conditional formatting you want to copy.\n• The pointer will change to a paintbrush. Tip: You can double-click Format Painter if you want to keep using the paintbrush to paste the conditional formatting in other cells.\n• Drag the paintbrush across the cells or range of cells you want formatted.\n• To stop using the paintbrush, press Esc. Note: If you’ve used a formula in the rule that applies the conditional formatting, you might have to adjust relative and absolute references in the formula after pasting the conditional format.

        "document": "Conditional formatting is a game-changer when it comes to making large data sets in Excel more readable and actionable. If you’ve ever wanted to draw attention to rows that meet specific criteria—whether it’s identifying underperforming metrics, blank entries, or matching specific text values—learning how to highlight rows in Excel is an essential skill. This article breaks down the step-by-step process, covering everything from formatting rows based on text or numeric values to applying multiple conditions with different colors. With these techniques, you can elevate your Excel sheets into powerful tools for visual data analysis.\n\nWhy Highlight Rows Based on a Cell Value\n\nHighlighting rows based on a cell value offers the following benefits:\n• Better Visualization: Make your spreadsheets more readable and visually engaging.\n\nConditional formatting is invaluable when dealing with large datasets. By highlighting specific rows based on certain conditions, you can quickly identify key information without manually sifting through the data. For instance, in a college database, administrators can highlight rows of students who have been blacklisted due to misconduct. This makes it easier to spot these records in a sea of data.\n\nConsider a company’s employees’ data is present. The following table consists of data about the project(s) which has been assigned to employees, their ages, and IDs. An employee can work on multiple projects. The blank cell in the project denotes that no project has been assigned to that employee.\n\nHow to Highlight Rows Based on a Cell Value\n\nFollow the below steps to use Conditional Formatting to highlight entire rows based on the value of a specific cell:\n• None Select the dataset you want to apply the formatting to.\n• None In this case, select the range\n• None Go to the Home\n• New Formatting Rule Use a Formula to Determine Which Cells to Format\n• None In the formula box, enter the following formula\n\nIn the formula box, write the formula :\n\nExplanation: The symbol locks column so that only values in column are checked for “Srishti”. The formula begins checking from cell and moves row by row.\n• None Go to the Fill tab and choose a color to highlight the rows (e.g., yellow).\n• OK again in the New Formatting Rule\n• None The rows where “Srishti” appears in column will now be highlighted.\n• None The rows containing “Srishti” in column will be formatted with the color you selected, making them easy to identify.\n• None Select the dataset you want to apply the formatting to.\n• None For example, select the range\n• None Go to the Home\n• New Formatting Rule Use a Formula to Determine Which Cells to Format\n\nExplanation: The symbol locks column so that only the age values in column are checked for being less than 25.\n• OK in the dialog box to apply the rule.\n• None Rows where the age is less than 25 will now be highlighted.\n\nConditional formatting in Excel allows you to apply custom rules using logical operators like OR and AND. These operators help define multiple conditions for highlighting rows.\n\nUnderstanding OR and AND Operators\n• OR: Highlights rows if at least one condition is true.\n• AND: Highlights rows only if all specified conditions are true.\n\nGo to the Home tab and click Conditional Formatting > New Rule.\n\nIn the New Formatting Rule dialog box, select Use a Formula to Determine Which Cells to Format.\n\nThe project details are in column D. So, the formula will be :\n\nClick Format, go to the Fill tab, and choose a color for highlighting rows.\n• OK again to apply the rule.\n\nRows where employees are working on “Project 1” or “Project 4” will now be highlighted.\n\nGo to the Home tab and click Conditional Formatting > New Rule.\n\nIn the New Formatting Rule dialog box, select Use a Formula to Determine Which Cells to Format.\n• None The AND function ensures both conditions are true:\n• None Only rows meeting both criteria will be highlighted.\n\nClick Format, go to the Fill tab, and choose a different color for highlighting rows.\n• None Click OK to close the formatting dialog box.\n• None Click OK again to apply the rule.\n• Rishabh P-3 ” will now be highlighted.\n\nThe name is in column B and the project details is in column D. The formula will be:\n• None Highlight the dataset where you want to apply the rule (e.g.,\n• None Go to the Home\n• New Formatting Rule Use a Formula to Determine Which Cells to Format\n• None Enter the following formula in the formula field\n• None Rows containing at least one blank cell in the range will now be highlighted.\n\n5. Highlight Rows Based on Multiple Conditions with Different Colors\n• Use a Formula to Determine Which Cells to Format\n• Senior Employees (age > 25) and move it to the top using the Up Arrow\n\nThis creates a problem as our goal is to make two separate groups. In order to resolve this we need to change the priority of highlighting the rows. The steps are :\n\nThe order of the condition needs to be changed. The condition at the top will have more priority than the lower one. So, we need to move the second condition to the top of the first one using the up icon after selecting the condition.\n\nIt can be observed that the rows are now divided into two categories:\n• yellow color is for the senior level employees\n• green color is for junior employees and trainees in the company on the basis of their ages.\n\nMastering the ability to format rows based on cell value not only makes your spreadsheets more intuitive but also enhances decision-making by presenting data in a visually organized manner. Whether you’re analyzing employee records, tracking sales trends, or managing inventory, these tips for using Excel conditional formatting rows will transform how you interact with your data.

In this new input box, enter the custom formula:\n\nThe key point to understand is that you lock the column you want to base your conditional formatting on by adding a $ (dollar sign) to the column reference.\n\nI start inputting the first cell of my highlighted range:\n\nIt’s really important that the row here matches the first row of your highlighted range (e.g. if your data is A10:C50 then your conditional formatting rule start with A10 too).\n\nThen I add the $ (dollar sign) in front of the A only:\n\nThen I add the test condition, in this case whether the cell equals “West”:\n\nAs the conditional formatting test is applied across each row, the value from the first cell in column A is used in the check.\n\nTo learn more about using the $ sign and understand relative and absolute references, have a read of this post: How To Use Google Sheets: A Beginner’s Guide\n\nMore Examples Of Conditional Formatting Across An Entire Row\n\nThis is a super useful application of this technique, to dynamically highlight rows of data in your tables where a value exceeds some threshold.\n\nIn this example, I’ve highlighted all of the students who scored less than 60 in class, using this formula in the custom formula field:\n\nGoogle Sheets checkboxes are super useful. If you haven't heard of them or used them yet, you're missing out.\n\nWhen a checkbox is selected it has the value TRUE, and when it is not selected the cell has the value FALSE. So we can use that property in our custom formula:\n\nAND Example: Highlight Whole Row When Two Conditions Are Both True\n\nOften we want to highlight based on two conditions. In this example, we'll see how to highlight the entire row when both conditions are true.\n\nHere, we want to highlight all rows with \"Apartment\" in column B and \"Buyer\" in column D.\n\nWe use an AND Function to do this.\n\nHighlight the dataset and add this conditional formatting custom formula:\n\nOR Example: Highlight Whole Row When Condition A or Condition B Are True\n\nThis is similar to the previous example, but now we want to highlight rows where either (or both) of the conditions are true.\n\nWe use an OR Function to do this.\n\nFirstly, let's see an example where the two conditions can exist in the same column.\n\nWe want to highlight all rows with \"House\" in column B or \"Townhouse\" in column B. Notice both conditions in column B.\n\nThis is the conditional formatting custom formula we use:\n\nThis time, imagine the two conditions exist in different columns.\n\nFor example, suppose we want to highlight all rows with \"House\" in column B or sales price > $700,000 in column E.\n\nUse this rule to achieve this:\n\n*** Notice how the rule starts on row 2 this time and is only applied to the data but not the header row. That's because the condition $E1 > 700000 evaluates to TRUE for the text heading (bizarre!), which we want to avoid.\n\nSuppose we want to check for a third condition...\n\nWe combine an AND function with an OR function and use brackets to determine the precedence (i.e. the order) that the tests are carried out.\n\nConsider this example:\n\nThe rule will highlight the row when there is either:\n• Column E is a number AND it's greater than $700,000\n\nThe two conditions on column E must both be TRUE for the AND to evaluate to TRUE.\n\nThis rule is another way to solve the header issue in the previous example.\n\nHow To Apply Conditional Formatting to an Entire Column\n\nWe use the same idea as with the examples above, but we lock the formula to a specific row instead of a column.\n\nSo the formula to apply conditional formatting to entire columns is:\n\nThis rule checks for client in row 1 and if it finds client, the formatting is applied to the whole of that column:\n\nIf you can't access the template, it might be because of your organization's Google Workspace settings.

        "document": "Conditional formatting typically works the same way in a range of cells, an Excel table, or a PivotTable report. However, conditional formatting in a PivotTable report has some extra considerations:\n• There are some conditional formats that don't work with fields in the Values area of a PivotTable report. For example, you can't format such fields based on whether they contain unique or duplicate values. These restrictions are mentioned in the remaining sections of this article, where applicable.\n• If you change the layout of the PivotTable report by filtering, hiding levels, collapsing and expanding levels, or moving a field, the conditional format is maintained as long as the fields in the underlying data are not removed.\n• The scope of the conditional format for fields in the Values area can be based on the data hierarchy and is determined by all the visible children (the next lower level in a hierarchy) of a parent (the next higher level in a hierarchy) on rows for one or more columns, or columns for one or more rows. Note: In the data hierarchy, children do not inherit conditional formatting from the parent, and the parent does not inherit conditional formatting from the children.\n• There are three methods for scoping the conditional format of fields in the Values area: by selection, by corresponding field, and by value field. The default method of scoping fields in the Values area is by selection. You can change the scoping method to the corresponding field or value field by using the Apply formatting rule to option button, the New Formatting Rule dialog box, or the Edit Formatting Rule dialog box. Use this method if you want to select\n• A contiguous set of fields in the Values area, such as all of the product totals for one region.\n• A non-contiguous set of fields in the Values area, such as product totals for different regions across levels in the data hierarchy.\n• Conditionally format a set of fields in the Values area for all levels in the hierarchy of data.\n• Conditionally format a set of fields in the Values area for one level in the hierarchy of data. When you conditionally format fields in the Values area for top, bottom, above average, or below average values, the rule is based on all visible values by default. However, when you scope by corresponding field, instead of using all visible values, you can apply the conditional format for each combination of: Use Quick Analysis to apply conditional formatting in Excel Use the Quick Analysis button to apply selected conditional formatting to the selected data. The Quick Analysis button appears automatically when you select data.\n• Select the data that you want to conditionally format. The Quick Analysis button appears on the lower-right corner of the selection.\n• In the pop-up that appears, on the Formatting tab, move your mouse over the different options to see a Live Preview on your data, and then click on the formatting option you want.\n• The formatting options that appear in the Formatting tab depend on the data you have selected. If your selection contains only text, then the available options are Text, Duplicate, Unique, Equal To, and Clear. When the selection contains only numbers, or both text and numbers, then the options are Data Bars, Colors, Icon Sets, Greater, Top 10%, and Clear.\n• Live preview will only render for those formatting options that can be used on your data. For example, if your selected cells don't contain matching data and you select Duplicate, the live preview will not work.\n• If the Text that Contains dialog box appears, enter the formatting option you want to apply and click OK. If you'd like to watch a video that shows how to use Quick Analysis to apply conditional formatting, see Video: Use conditional formatting. You can download a sample workbook that contains different examples of applying conditional formatting, both with standard rules such as top and bottom, duplicates, Data Bars, Icon Sets and Color Scales, as well as manually creating rules of your own. Color scales are visual guides that help you understand data distribution and variation. A two-color scale helps you compare a range of cells by using a gradation of two colors. The shade of the color represents higher or lower values. For example, in a green and yellow color scale, as shown below, you can specify that higher value cells have a more green color and lower value cells have a more yellow color. Tip: You can sort cells that have this format by their color - just use the context menu. Tip: If any cells in the selection contain a formula that returns an error, the conditional formatting is not applied to those cells. To ensure that the conditional formatting is applied to those cells, use an IS or IFERROR function to return a value other than an error value.\n• Select one or more cells in a range, table, or PivotTable report.\n• On the Home tab, in the Styles group, click the arrow next to Conditional Formatting, and then click Color Scales.\n• Hover over the color scale icons to see which icon is a two-color scale. The top color represents higher values, and the bottom color represents lower values. You can change the method of scoping for fields in the Values area of a PivotTable report by using the Formatting Options button that appears next to a PivotTable field that has conditional formatting applied.\n• Select one or more cells in a range, table, or PivotTable report.\n• On the Home tab, in the Styles group, click the arrow next to Conditional Formatting, and then click Manage Rules.

If you want to choose additional colors or create a custom color, click More Colors. The color scale you select is shown in the Preview box. Format cells by using a three-color scale in Excel Color scales are visual guides that help you understand data distribution and variation. A three-color scale helps you compare a range of cells by using a gradation of three colors. The shade of the color represents higher, middle, or lower values. For example, in a green, yellow, and red color scale, you can specify that higher value cells have a green color, middle value cells have a yellow color, and lower value cells have a red color.

Do one of the following:\n• In this case, you do not enter a Lowest and HighestValue.\n• Format a number, date, or time value: Select Number and then enter a value for Minimum, Midpoint, and Maximum.\n• Format a percentage: Select Percent and then enter a value for Minimum, Midpoint, and Maximum. Valid values are from 0 (zero) to 100. Do not enter a percent (%) sign. Use a percentage when you want to visualize all values proportionally, because using a percentage ensures that the distribution of values is proportional.\n• Format a percentile: Select Percentile and then enter a value for Minimum, Midpoint, and Maximum. Valid percentiles are from 0 (zero) to 100. Use a percentile when you want to visualize a group of high values (such as the top 20th percentile) in one color grade proportion and low values (such as the bottom 20th percentile) in another color grade proportion, because they represent extreme values that might skew the visualization of your data.\n• Format a formula result: Select Formula and then enter a value for Minimum, Midpoint, and Maximum. The formula must return a number, date, or time value. Start the formula with an equal sign (=). Invalid formulas result in no formatting being applied. It's a good idea to test the formula to make sure that it doesn't return an error value.\n• You can set minimum, midpoint, and maximum values for the range of cells. Make sure that the value in Minimum is less than the value in Midpoint, which in turn is less than the value in Maximum.\n• You can choose a different type for Minimum, Midpoint, and Maximum. For example, you can choose a Minimum number, Midpoint percentile, and Maximum percent.\n• In many cases, the default Midpoint value of 50 percent works best, but you can adjust this to fit unique requirements.\n• To choose a Minimum, Midpoint, and Maximum color scale, click Color for each, and then select a color.\n• To choose additional colors or create a custom color, click More Colors.\n• The color scale you select is shown in the Preview box. A data bar helps you see the value of a cell relative to other cells. The length of the data bar represents the value in the cell. A longer bar represents a higher value, and a shorter bar represents a lower value. Data bars are useful in spotting higher and lower numbers, especially with large amounts of data, such as top selling and bottom selling toys in a holiday sales report. The example shown here uses data bars to highlight dramatic positive and negative values. You can format data bars so that the data bar starts in the middle of the cell, and stretches to the left for negative values. Tip: If any cells in the range contain a formula that returns an error, the conditional formatting is not applied to those cells. To ensure that the conditional formatting is applied to those cells, use an IS or IFERROR function to return a value (such as 0 or \"N/A\") instead of an error value.\n• Select one or more cells in a range, table, or PivotTable report.\n• On the Home tab, in the Style group, click the arrow next to Conditional Formatting, click Data Bars, and then select a data bar icon.

The bar color you select is shown in the Preview box.\n• To show only the data bar and not the value in the cell, select Show Bar Only.\n• To apply a solid border to data bars, select Solid Border in the Border list box and choose a color for the border.\n• To choose between a solid bar and a gradiated bar, choose Solid Fill or Gradient Fill in the Fill list box.\n• To format negative bars, click Negative Value and Axis and then, in the Negative Value and Axis Settings dialog box, choose options for the negative bar fill and border colors. You can choose position settings and a color for the axis. When you are finished selecting options, click OK.\n• You can change the direction of bars by choosing a setting in the Bar Direction list box. This is set to Context by default, but you can choose between a left-to-right and a right-to-left direction, depending on how you want to present your data. Format cells by using an icon set Use an icon set to annotate and classify data into three to five categories separated by a threshold value. Each icon represents a range of values. For example, in the 3 Arrows icon set, the green up arrow represents higher values, the yellow sideways arrow represents middle values, and the red down arrow represents lower values. Tip: You can sort cells that have this format by their icon - just use the context menu. The example shown here works with several examples of conditional formatting icon sets. You can choose to show icons only for cells that meet a condition; for example, displaying a warning icon for those cells that fall below a critical value and no icons for those that exceed it. To do this, you hide icons by selecting No Cell Icon from the icon drop-down list next to the icon when you are setting conditions. You can also create your own combination of icon sets; for example, a green \"symbol\" check mark, a yellow \"traffic light\", and a red \"flag.\" Tip: If any cells in the selection contain a formula that returns an error, the conditional formatting is not applied to those cells. To ensure that the conditional formatting is applied to those cells, use an IS or IFERROR function to return a value (such as 0 or \"N/A\") instead of an error value.\n• Select the cells that you want to conditionally format.\n• On the Home tab, in the Style group, click the arrow next to Conditional Formatting, click Icon Set, and then select an icon set.

The default is 3 Traffic Lights (Unrimmed). The number of icons and the default comparison operators and threshold values for each icon can vary for each icon set.\n• You can adjust the comparison operators and threshold values. The default range of values for each icon are equal in size, but you can adjust these to fit your unique requirements. Make sure that the thresholds are in a logical sequence of highest to lowest from top to bottom.\n• \n• Valid values are from 0 (zero) to 100. Do not enter a percent (%) sign. Use a percentage when you want to visualize all values proportionally, because using a percentage ensures that the distribution of values is proportional.\n• Format a percentile: Select Percentile. Valid percentiles are from 0 (zero) to 100. Use a percentile when you want to visualize a group of high values (such as the top 20th percentile) using a particular icon and low values (such as the bottom 20th percentile) using another icon, because they represent extreme values that might skew the visualization of your data.\n• Format a formula result: Select Formula, and then enter a formula in each Value box.\n• The formula must return a number, date, or time value.\n• Start the formula with an equal sign (=).\n• Invalid formulas result in no formatting being applied.\n• It's a good idea to test the formula to make sure that it doesn't return an error value.\n• To make the first icon represent lower values and the last icon represent higher values, select Reverse Icon Order.\n• To show only the icon and not the value in the cell, select Show Icon Only.\n• You may need to adjust the column width to accommodate the icon.\n• The size of the icon shown depends on the font size that is used in that cell. As the size of the font is increased, the size of the icon increases proportionally. Format cells that contain text, number, or date or time values To more easily find specific cells, you can format them by using a comparison operator. For example, in an inventory worksheet sorted by categories, you could highlight products with fewer than 10 items on hand in yellow. Or, in a retail store summary worksheet, you might identify all stores with profits greater than 10%, sales volumes less than $100,000, and region equal to \"SouthEast.\" The examples shown here work with examples of built-in conditional formatting criteria, such as Greater Than, and Top %. This formats cities with a population greater than 2,000,000 with a green background and average high temperatures in the top 30% with orange. Note: You cannot conditionally format fields in the Values area of a PivotTable report by text or by date, only by number.\n• Select one or more cells in a range, table, or PivotTable report.\n• On the Home tab, in the Style group, click the arrow next to Conditional Formatting, and then click Highlight Cells Rules.\n• Select the command you want, such as Between, Equal To Text that Contains, or A Date Occurring.\n• Enter the values you want to use, and then select a format. You can change the method of scoping for fields in the Values area of a PivotTable report by using the Apply formatting rule to option button.

For example, select Between and then enter 100 and 200, or select Equal to and then enter 1/1/2009. You can also enter a formula that returns a number, date, or time value.\n• If you enter a formula, start it with an equal sign (=).\n• Invalid formulas result in no formatting being applied.\n• It's a good idea to test the formula to make sure that it doesn't return an error value.\n• Format by text: Select Specific Text, choosing a comparison operator, and then enter text. For example, select Contains and then enter Silver, or select Starting with and then enter Tri. Quotes are included in the search string, and you may use wildcard characters. The maximum length of a string is 255 characters. You can also enter a formula that returns text.\n• If you enter a formula, start it with an equal sign (=).\n• Invalid formulas result in no formatting being applied.\n• It's a good idea to test the formula to make sure that it doesn't return an error value. To see a video of this technique, see Video: Conditionally format text.\n• Format by date: Select Dates Occurring and then select a date comparison. For example, select Yesterday or Next week. To see a video of this technique, see Video: Conditionally format dates.\n• Format cells with blanks or no blanks: Select Blanks or No Blanks. A blank value is a cell that contains no data and is different from a cell that contains one or more spaces (spaces are considered as text).\n• Format cells with error or no error values: Select Errors or No Errors. Error values include: #####, #VALUE!, #DIV/0!, #NAME?, #N/A, #REF!, #NUM!, and #NULL!.\n• To specify a format, click Format.

You can choose more than one format. The formats you select are displayed in the Preview box. Note: You can't conditionally format fields in the Values area of a PivotTable report by unique or duplicate values. Tip: When using the \"Duplicate Values\" formatting rule, if the \"Office authoring languages and proofing\" setting is set to a language that uses Double-byte character set (DBCS) encoding, such as Japanese, halfwidth and fullwidth characters are treated the same. If you need to differentiate between them, you can use the \"Use a formula to determine where this formula is true\" rule type with a COUNTIF formula. For example, to identify duplicate values in the range A2:A400, apply the formula \"=COUNTIF($A$2:$A$400,A2)> 1\" for conditional formatting. In the example shown here, conditional formatting is used on the Instructor column to find instructors that are teaching more than one class (duplicate instructor names are highlighted in a pale red color). Grade values that are found just once in the Grade column (unique values) are highlighted in a green color.\n• Select the cells that you want to conditionally format.\n• On the Home tab, in the Style group, click the arrow next to Conditional Formatting, and then click Highlight Cells Rules.\n• Enter the values you want to use, and then select a format.\n• Select the cells that you want to conditionally format.\n• On the Home tab, in the Styles group, click the arrow next to Conditional Formatting, and then click Manage Rules.

You can choose more than one format. The formats you select are shown in the Preview box. Set up your own conditional formatting rule If none of the above options is what you’re looking for, you can create your own conditional formatting rule in a few simple steps. Notes: If there's already a rule defined that you just want to work a bit differently, duplicate the rule and edit it.\n• Select Home > Conditional Formatting > Manage Rules, then in the Conditional Formatting Rule Manager dialog, select a listed rule and then select Duplicate Rule. The duplicate rule then appears in the list.\n• Select the cells that you want to format.\n• On the Home tab, click Conditional Formatting > New Rule.\n• Create your rule and specify its format options, then click OK. If you don't see the options that you want, you can use a formula to determine which cells to format - see the next section for steps). Use a formula to determine which cells to format If you don't see the exact options you need when you create your own conditional formatting rule, you can use a logical formula to specify the formatting criteria. For example, you may want to compare values in a selection to a result returned by a function or evaluate data in cells outside the selected range, which can be in another worksheet in the same workbook. Your formula must return True or False (1 or 0), but you can use conditional logic to string together a set of corresponding conditional formats, such as different colors for each of a small set of text values (for example, product category names). Note: You can enter cell references in a formula by selecting cells directly on a worksheet or other worksheets. Selecting cells on the worksheet inserts absolute cell references. If you want Excel to adjust the references for each cell in the selected range, use relative cell references. For more information, see Create or change a cell reference and Switch between relative, absolute, and mixed references. Tip: If any cells contain a formula that returns an error, conditional formatting is not applied to those cells. To address this, use IS functions or an IFERROR function in your formula to return a value that you specify (such as 0, or \"N/A\") instead of an error value.\n• On the Home tab, in the Styles group, click the arrow next to Conditional Formatting, and then click Manage Rules.\n• \n• To add a conditional format, click New Rule. The New Formatting Rule dialog box appears.\n• To add a new conditional format based on one that is already listed, select the rule, then click Duplicate Rule. The duplicate rule is copied and appears in the dialog box. Select the duplicate, then select Edit Rule. The Edit Formatting Rule dialog box appears.\n• To change a conditional format, do the following:\n• \n• Make sure that the appropriate worksheet, table, or PivotTable report is selected in the Show formatting rules for list box.\n• Optionally, change the range of cells by clicking Collapse Dialog in the Applies to box to temporarily hide the dialog box, by selecting the new range of cells on the worksheet or other worksheets, and then by clicking Expand Dialog.\n• Select the rule, and then click Edit rule. The Edit Formatting Rule dialog box appears.\n• Under Apply Rule To, to optionally change the scope for fields in the Values area of a PivotTable report, do the following:\n• To scope by corresponding field: Click All cells showing <Values field> values.\n• To scope by Value field: Click All cells showing <Values field> for <Row>.\n• Under Select a Rule Type, click Use a formula to determine which cells to format.\n• Under Edit the Rule Description, in the Format values where this formula is true list box, enter a formula.\n\n\n\n You have to start the formula with an equal sign (=), and the formula must return a logical value of TRUE (1) or FALSE (0).\n• Select the number, font, border, or fill format you want to apply when the cell value meets the condition, and then click OK.\n\n\n\n You can choose more than one format. The formats you select are shown in the Preview box. Example 1: Use two conditional formats with criteria that uses AND and OR tests The following example shows the use of two conditional formatting rules. If the first rule doesn't apply, the second rule applies. First rule: a home buyer has budgeted up to $75,000 as a down payment and $1,500 per month as a mortgage payment. If both the down payment and the monthly payments fit these requirements, cells B4 and B5 are formatted green. Second rule: if either the down payment or the monthly payment doesn't meet the buyer's budget, B4 and B5 are formatted red. Change some values, such as the APR, the loan term, the down payment, and the purchase amount to see what happens with the conditionally formatted cells. Example 2: Shade every other row by using the MOD and ROW functions A conditional format applied to every cell in this worksheet shades every other row in the range of cells with a blue cell color. You can select all cells in a worksheet by clicking the square above row 1 and to the left of column A. The MOD function returns a remainder after a number (the first argument) is divided by divisor (the second argument). The ROW function returns the current row number. When you divide the current row number by 2, you always get either a 0 remainder for an even number or a 1 remainder for an odd number. Because 0 is FALSE and 1 is TRUE, every odd numbered row is formatted. The rule uses this formula: =MOD(ROW(),2)=1. Note: You can enter cell references in a formula by selecting cells directly on a worksheet or other worksheets. Selecting cells on the worksheet inserts absolute cell references. If you want Excel to adjust the references for each cell in the selected range, use relative cell references. For more information, see Create or change a cell reference and Switch between relative, absolute, and mixed references. The following video shows you the basics of using formulas with conditional formatting. If you want to apply an existing formatting style to new or other data on your worksheet, you can use Format Painter to copy the conditional formatting to that data.\n• Click the cell that has the conditional formatting that you want to copy.\n• The pointer changes to a paintbrush. Tip: You can double-click Format Painter if you want to keep using the paintbrush to paste the conditional formatting in other cells.\n• To paste the conditional formatting, drag the paintbrush across the cells or ranges of cells you want to format.\n• To stop using the paintbrush, press Esc. Note: If you’ve used a formula in the rule that applies the conditional formatting, you might have to adjust any cell references in the formula after pasting the conditional format. For more information, see Switch between relative, absolute, and mixed references. If your worksheet contains conditional formatting, you can quickly locate the cells so that you can copy, change, or delete the conditional formats. Use the Go To Special command to find only cells with a specific conditional format, or to find all cells that have conditional formats. Find all cells that have a conditional format\n• Click any cell that does not have a conditional format.\n• On the Home tab, in the Editing group, click the arrow next to Find & Select, and then click Conditional Formatting. Find only cells that have the same conditional format\n• Click any cell that has the conditional format that you want to find.\n• On the Home tab, in the Editing group, click the arrow next to Find & Select, and then click Go To Special. When you use conditional formatting, you set up rules that Excel uses to determine when to apply the conditional formatting. To manage these rules, you should understand the order in which these rules are evaluated, what happens when two or more rules conflict, how copying and pasting can affect rule evaluation, how to change the order in which rules are evaluated, and when to stop rule evaluation.\n• You create, edit, delete, and view all conditional formatting rules in the workbook by using the Conditional Formatting Rules Manager dialog box. (On the Home tab, click Conditional Formatting, and then click Manage Rules.) When two or more conditional formatting rules apply, these rules are evaluated in order of precedence (top to bottom) by how they are listed in this dialog box. Here's an example that has expiration dates for ID badges. We want to mark badges that expire within 60 days but are not yet expired with a yellow background color, and expired badges with a red background color. In this example, cells with employee ID numbers who have certification dates due to expire within 60 days are formatted in yellow, and ID numbers of employees with an expired certification are formatted in red. The rules are shown in the following image. The first rule (which, if True, sets cell background color to red) tests a date value in column B against the current date (obtained by using the TODAY function in a formula). Assign the formula to the first data value in column B, which is B2. The formula for this rule is =B2<TODAY(). This formula tests the cells in column B (cells B2:B15). If the formula for any cell in column B evaluates to True, its corresponding cell in column A (for example, A5 corresponds to B5, A11 corresponds to B11), is then formatted with a red background color. After all the cells specified under Applies to are evaluated with this first rule, the second rule is tested. This formula checks if values in the B column are less than 60 days from the current date (for example, suppose today’s date is 8/11/2010). The cell in B4, 10/4/2010, is less than 60 days from today, so it evaluates as True, and is formatted with a yellow background color. The formula for this rule is =B2<TODAY()+60. Any cell that was first formatted red by the highest rule in the list is left alone. A rule higher in the list has greater precedence than a rule lower in the list. By default, new rules are always added to the top of the list and therefore have a higher precedence, so you'll want to keep an eye on their order. You can change the order of precedence by using the Move Up and Move Down arrows in the dialog box.\n• What happens when more than one conditional formatting rule evaluates to True Sometimes you have more than one conditional formatting rule that evaluates to True. Here's how rules are applied, first when rules don't conflict, and then when they do conflict: When rules don't conflict For example, if one rule formats a cell with a bold font and another rule formats the same cell with a red color, the cell is formatted with both a bold font and a red color. Because there is no conflict between the two formats, both rules are applied. When rules conflict For example, one rule sets a cell font color to red and another rule sets a cell font color to green. Because the two rules are in conflict, only one can apply. The rule that is applied is the one that is higher in precedence (higher in the list in the dialog box).\n• How pasting, filling, and the Format Painter affect conditional formatting rules While editing your worksheet, you may copy and paste cell values that have conditional formats, fill a range of cells with conditional formats, or use the Format Painter. These operations can affect conditional formatting rule precedence in the following way: a new conditional formatting rule based on the source cells is created for the destination cells. If you copy and paste cell values that have conditional formats to a worksheet opened in another instance of Excel (another Excel.exe process running at the same time on the computer), no conditional formatting rule is created in the other instance and the format is not copied to that instance.\n• What happens when a conditional format and a manual format conflict If a conditional formatting rule evaluates as True, it takes precedence over any existing manual format for the same selection. This means that if they conflict, the conditional formatting applies and the manual format does not. If you delete the conditional formatting rule, the manual formatting for the range of cells remains. Manual formatting is not listed in the Conditional Formatting Rules Manager dialog box nor is it used to determine precedence.\n• Controlling when rule evaluation stops by using the Stop If True check box For backwards compatibility, select the Stop If True check box in the Manage Rules dialog box to simulate how conditional formatting might appear in those earlier versions of Excel that do not support more than three conditional formatting rules or multiple rules applied to the same range. For example, if you have more than three conditional formatting rules for a range of cells, and are working with an earlier version of Excel, that version of Excel:\n• Evaluates only the first three rules.\n• Applies the first rule in precedence that is True.\n• Ignores rules lower in precedence if they are True. The following table summarizes each possible condition for the first three rules: Rule one is applied and rules two and three are ignored. Rule two is applied and rule three is ignored. You can select or clear the Stop If True check box to change the default behavior:\n• To evaluate only the first rule, select the Stop If True check box for the first rule.\n• To evaluate only the first and second rules, select the Stop If True check box for the second rule. You can't select or clear the Stop If True check box if the rule formats by using a data bar, color scale, or icon set. If you'd like to watch a video showing how to manage conditional formatting rules, see Video: Manage conditional formatting. Edit the order in which conditional formatting rules are evaluated The order in which conditional formatting rules are evaluated - their precedence - also reflects their relative importance: the higher a rule is on the list of conditional formatting rules, the more important it is. This means that in cases where two conditional formatting rules conflict with each other, the rule that is higher on the list is applied and the rule that is lower on the list is not applied.\n• On the Home tab, in the Styles group, click the arrow next to Conditional Formatting, and then click Manage Rules. The conditional formatting rules for the current selection are displayed, including the rule type, the format, the range of cells the rule applies to, and the Stop If True setting. If you don't see the rule that you want, in the Show formatting rules for list box, make sure that the right range of cells, worksheet, table, or PivotTable report is selected.\n• Select a rule. Only one rule can be selected at a time.\n• To move the selected rule up in precedence, click Move Up. To move the selected rule down in precedence, click Move Down.\n• Optionally, to stop rule evaluation at a specific rule, select the Stop If True check box.\n• On the Home tab, click Conditional Formatting > Clear Rules > Clear Rules from Entire Sheet. Follow these steps if you have conditional formatting in a worksheet, and you need to remove it.\n• On the Home tab, click Conditional Formatting > Clear Rules > Clear Rules from Entire Sheet.\n• Select the cells that contain the conditional formatting.\n• Click the Quick Analysis Lens button that appears to the bottom right of the selected data. Notes: Quick Analysis Lens will not be visible if:\n• All of the cells in the selected range are empty, or\n• There is an entry only in the upper-left cell of the selected range, with all of the other cells in the range being empty. Find and remove the same conditional formats throughout a worksheet\n• Click on a cell that has the conditional format that you want to remove throughout the worksheet.\n• On the Home tab, click the arrow next to Find & Select, and then click Go To Special.\n• Click Same under Data validation. to select all of the cells that contain the same conditional formatting rules.\n• On the Home tab, click Conditional Formatting > Clear Rules > Clear Rules from Selected Cells.\n\nTip: The following sections use examples so you can follow along in Excel for the web. To start, download the Conditional Formatting Examples workbook and save it to OneDrive. Then, open OneDrive in a web browser and select the downloaded file.\n• Select the cells you want to format, then select Home > Styles > Conditional Formatting > New Rule. You can also open the Conditional Formatting pane and create a new rule without first selecting a range of cells.\n• Verify or adjust the cells in Apply to range.\n• Choose a Rule Type and adjust the options to meet your needs.\n• When finished, select Done and the rule will be applied to your range.\n• Select a cell which has a conditional format you want to change. Or you can select Home > Styles > Conditional Formatting > Manage Rules to open the Conditional Formatting task pane and select an existing rule.\n• The Conditional Formatting task pane displays any rules which apply to specific cells or ranges of cells.\n• Hover over the rule and select Edit by clicking the pencil icon. This opens the task pane for rule editing.\n• Modify the rule settings and click Done to apply the changes. The Conditional Formatting task pane provides everything you need for creating, editing, and deleting rules. Use Manage Rules to open the task pane and work with all the Conditional Formatting rules in a selection or a sheet.\n• The Conditional Formatting task pane opens and displays the rules, scoped to your current selection.\n• Choose a different scope on the Manage Rules in menu - for example, choosing this sheet tells Excel to look for all rules on the current sheet.\n• Add a rule by selecting New Rule (the plus sign).\n• Delete all rules in scope by selecting Delete All Rules (the garbage can). Use a formula to determine which cells to format You can use a formula to determine how Excel evaluates and formats a cell. Open the Conditional Formatting pane and select an existing rule or create a new rule. Enter the formula in the box. You can use any formula that returns a logical value of TRUE (1) or FALSE (0), but you can use AND and OR to combine a set of logical checks. For example, =AND(B3=\"Grain\",D3<500) is true for a cell in row 3 if both B3=\"Grain\" and D3<500 are true.\n\n\n\n You can clear conditional formatting in selected cells or the entire worksheet.\n• To clear conditional formatting in selected cells, select the cells in the worksheet. Then Select Home > Styles > Conditional Formatting > Clear Rules > Clear Rules from Selected Cells.\n• To clear conditional formatting in the entire worksheet, select Home > Styles > Conditional Formatting > Clear Rules > Clear Rules from Entire Sheet.\n• To delete conditional formatting rules, select Home > Styles > Conditional Formatting >Manage Rules and use the delete (garbage can) on a specific rule or the Delete all rules button. Color scales are visual guides which help you understand data distribution and variation. Excel offers both two-color scales and three-color scales. A two-color scale helps you compare a range of cells by using a gradation of two colors. The shade of the color represents higher or lower values. For example, in a green and yellow color scale, you can specify that higher value cells be more green and lower value cells have a more yellow. A three-color scale helps you compare a range of cells by using a gradation of three colors. The shade of the color represents higher, middle, or lower values. For example, in a green, yellow, and red color scale, you can specify that higher value cells have a green color, middle value cells have a yellow color, and lower value cells have a red color. Tip: You can sort cells that have one of these formats by their color - just use the context menu.\n• Select the cells that you want to conditionally format using color scales. A data bar helps you see the value of a cell relative to other cells. The length of the data bar represents the value in the cell. A longer bar represents a higher value, and a shorter bar represents a lower value. Data bars are useful in spotting higher and lower numbers, especially with large amounts of data, such as top selling and bottom selling toys in a holiday sales report.\n• Select the cells that you want to conditionally format. Format cells by using an icon set Use an icon set to annotate and classify data into three to five categories separated by a threshold value. Each icon represents a range of values. For example, in the 3 Arrows icon set, the green up arrow represents higher values, the yellow sideways arrow represents middle values, and the red down arrow represents lower values.\n• Select the cells that you want to conditionally format. Format only cells that contain text, number, or date/time values This option lets you highlight specific cell values within a range of cells based on their specific contents. This can be especially useful when working with data sorted using a different range. For example, in an inventory worksheet sorted by categories, you could highlight the names of products where you have fewer than 10 items in stock so it's easy to see which products need restocking without resorting the data.\n• Select the cells that you want to conditionally format.\n• Select the comparison, such as Between, Equal To, Text That Contains, or A Date Occurring. You can highlight the highest and lowest values in a range of cells which are based on a specified cutoff value. Some examples of this would include highlighting the top five selling products in a regional report, the bottom 15% products in a customer survey, or the top 25 salaries in a department.\n• Select the cells that you want to conditionally format.\n• Select the command you want, such as Top 10 items or Bottom 10 %.\n• Enter the values you want to use, and select a format (fill, text, or border color). Format only values that are above or below average You can highlight values above or below an average or standard deviation in a range of cells. For example, you can find the above-average performers in an annual performance review, or locate manufactured materials that fall below two standard deviations in a quality rating.\n• Select the cells that you want to conditionally format.\n• Select the option you want, such as Above Average or Below Average.\n• Enter the values you want to use, and select a format (fill, text, or border color).\n• Select the cells that you want to conditionally format.\n• Enter the values you want to use, and select a format (fill, text, or border color). If you want to apply an existing formatting style to other cells on your worksheet, use Format Painter to copy the conditional formatting to that data.\n• Click the cell that has the conditional formatting you want to copy.\n• The pointer will change to a paintbrush. Tip: You can double-click Format Painter if you want to keep using the paintbrush to paste the conditional formatting in other cells.\n• Drag the paintbrush across the cells or range of cells you want formatted.\n• To stop using the paintbrush, press Esc. Note: If you’ve used a formula in the rule that applies the conditional formatting, you might have to adjust relative and absolute references in the formula after pasting the conditional format. For more information, see Switch between relative, absolute, and mixed references."

        "document": "In this tutorial, we will continue exploring the fascinating world of Excel Conditional Formatting. If you do not feel very comfortable in this area, you may want to look through the previous article first to revive the basics - How to use conditional formatting in Excel.\n\nToday are going to dwell on how to use Excel formulas to format individual cells and entire rows based on the values you specify or based on another cell's value. This is often considered advanced aerobatics of Excel conditional formatting and once mastered, it will help you push the formats in your spreadsheets far beyond their common uses.\n\nExcel conditional formatting based on another cell value Excel's predefined conditional formatting, such as Data Bars, Color Scales and Icon Sets, are mainly purposed to format cells based on their own values. If you want to apply conditional formatting based on another cell or format an entire row based on a single cell's value, then you will need to use formulas. So, let's see how you can make a rule using a formula and after discuss formula examples for specific tasks.\n\n\n\nNow that you know how to create and apply Excel conditional formatting based on another cell, let's move on and see how to use various Excel formulas in practice. Tip. For your Excel conditional formatting formula to work correctly, please always follow these simple rules. As you know Microsoft Excel provides a handful of ready-to-use rules to format cells with values greater than, less than or equal to the value you specify (Conditional Formatting >Highlight Cells Rules). However, these rules do not work if you want to conditionally format certain columns or entire rows based on a cell's value in another column. In this case, you use analogous formulas: Greater than or equal to Less than or equal to The screenshot below shows an example of the Greater than formula that highlights product names in column A if the number of items in stock (column C) is greater than 0. Please pay attention that the formula applies to column A only ($A$2:$A$8). But if you select the whole table (in our case, $A$2:$E$8), this will highlight entire rows based on the value in column C.\n\n In a similar fashion, you can create a conditional formatting rule to compare values of two cells. For example: - format cells or rows if a value in column A is less than the corresponding value in column B. - format cells or rows if values in columns A and B are the same. - format cells or rows if a value in column A is not the same as in column B. As you can see in the screenshot below, these formulas work for text values as well as for numbers.\n\n \n\n AND and OR formulas If you want to format your Excel table based on 2 or more conditions, then use either =AND or =OR function: If both conditions are met Formats cells if the value in column B is less than in column C, and if the value in column C is less than in column D. If one of the conditions is met Formats cells if the value in column B is less than in column C, or if the value in column C is less than in column D. In the screenshot below, we use the formula to change the background color of rows if the number of items in stock (Column C) is greater than 0 and if the product ships worldwide (Column D). Please pay attention that the formula works with text values as well as with numbers.\n\n Naturally, you can use two, three or more conditions in your AND and OR formulas. To see how this works in practice, watch Video: Conditional formatting based on another cell. These are the basic conditional formatting formulas you use in Excel. Now let's consider a bit more complex but far more interesting examples.\n\n I think everyone knows how to format empty and not empty cells in Excel - you simply create a new rule of the \"Format only cells that contain\" type and choose either Blanks or No Blanks.\n\n But what if you want to format cells in a certain column if a corresponding cell in another column is empty or not empty? In this case, you will need to utilize Excel formulas again: Formula for blanks: - format selected cells / rows if a corresponding cell in Column B is blank. Formula for non-blanks: - format selected cells / rows if a corresponding cell in Column B is not blank. Note. The formulas above will work for cells that are \"visually\" empty or not empty. If you use some Excel function that returns an empty string, e.g. , and you don't want such cells to be treated as blanks, use the following formulas instead or to format blank and non-blank cells, respectively. And here is an example of how you can use the above formulas in practice. Suppose, you have a column (B) which is \"Date of Sale\" and another column (C) \"Delivery\". These 2 columns have a value only if a sale has been made and the item delivered. So, you want the entire row to turn orange when you've made a sale; and when an item is delivered, a corresponding row should turn green. To achieve this, you need to create 2 conditional formatting rules with the following formulas:\n• Orange rows (a cell in column B is not empty):\n• Green rows (cells in column B and column C are not empty): One more thing for you to do is to move the second rule to the top and select the Stop if true check box next to this rule:\n\n In this particular case, the \"Stop if true\" option is actually superfluous, and the rule will work with or without it. You may want to check this box just as an extra precaution, in case you add a few other rules in the future that may conflict with any of the existing ones. For more information, please see Excel conditional formatting for blank cells.\n\n If you want to format a certain column(s) when another cell in the same row contains a certain word, you can use a formula discussed in one of the previous examples (like =$D2=\"Worldwide\"). However, this will only work for exact match. For partial match, you will need to use either SEARCH (case insensitive) or FIND (case sensitive). For example, to format selected cells or rows if a corresponding cell in column D contains the word \"Worldwide\", use the below formula. This formula will find all such cells, regardless of where the specified text is located in a cell, including \"Ships Worldwide\", \"Worldwide, except for…\", etc: If you'd like to shade selected cells or rows if the cell's content starts with the search text, use this one: If your task is to conditionally format cells with duplicate values, you can go with the pre-defined rule available under Conditional formatting > Highlight Cells Rules > Duplicate Values… The following article provides a detailed guidance on how to use this feature: How to automatically highlight duplicates in Excel. However, in some cases the data looks better if you color selected columns or entire rows when a duplicate values occurs in another column. In this case, you will need to employ an Excel conditional formatting formula again, and this time we will be using the COUNTIF formula. As you know, this Excel function counts the number of cells within a specified range that meet a single criterion. - this formula finds duplicate values in the specified range in Column A (A2:A10 in our case), including first occurrences. If you choose to apply the rule to the entire table, the whole rows will get formatted, as you see in the screenshot below. I've decided to change a font color in this rule, just for a change : )\n\n \n\n To ignore the first occurrence and highlight only subsequent duplicate values, use this formula: \n\n \n\n If you'd rather highlight only duplicates on consecutive rows, you can do this in the following way. This method works for any data types: numbers, text values and dates.\n• Select the column where you want to highlight duplicates, without the column header.\n• Create a conditional formatting rule(s) using these simple formulas:\n\n Rule 1 (blue): - highlights the 2nd occurrence and all subsequent occurrences, if any.\n\n Rule 2 (green): - highlights the 1st occurrence. In the above formulas, A is the column you want to check for dupes, $A1 is the column header, $A2 is the first cell with data. Important! For the formulas to work correctly, it is essential that Rule 1, which highlights the 2nd and all subsequent duplicate occurrences, should be the first rule in the list, especially if you are using two different colors.\n\n \n\n If you want apply the conditional format when duplicate values occur in two or more columns, you will need to add an extra column to your table in which you concatenate the values from the key columns using a simple formula like this one . After that you apply a rule using either variation of the COUNTIF formula for duplicates (with or without 1st occurrences). Naturally, you can hide an additional column after creating the rule.\n\n Alternatively, you can use the COUNTIFS function that supports multiple criteria in a single formula. In this case, you won't need a helper column. In this example, to highlight duplicate rows with 1st occurrences, create a rule with the following formula:\n\n To highlight duplicate rows without 1st occurrences, use this formula:\n\n \n\n One of the most frequent tasks in Excel is to check 2 columns for duplicate values - i.e. find and highlight values that exist in both columns. To do this, you will need to create an Excel conditional formatting rule for each column with a combination of and functions: Note. For such conditional formulas to work correctly, it's very important that you apply the rules to the entire columns, e.g. and . You can see an example of practical usage in the following screenshot that highlights duplicates in Columns E and F.\n\n As you can see, Excel conditional formatting formulas cope with dupes pretty well. However, for more complex cases, I would recommend using the Duplicate Remover add-in that is especially designed to find, highlight and remove duplicates in Excel, in one sheet or between two spreadsheets.\n\n Formulas to highlight values above or below average When you work with several sets of numeric data, the AVERAGE() function may come in handy to format cells whose values are below or above the average in a column. For example, you can use the formula to conditionally format the rows where the sale numbers are below the average, as shown in the screenshot below. If you are looking for the opposite, i.e. to shade the products performing above the average, replace \"<\" with \">\" in the formula: .\n\n \n\n How to highlight the nearest value in Excel If I have a set of numbers, is there a way I can use Excel conditional formatting to highlight the number in that set that is closest to zero? This is what one of our blog readers, Jessica, wanted to know. The question is very clear and straightforward, but the answer is a bit too long for the comments sections, that's why you see a solution here :) Example 1. Find the nearest value, including exact match In our example, we'll find and highlight the number that is closest to zero. If the data set contains one or more zeroes, all of them will be highlighted. If there is no 0, then the value closest to it, either positive or negative, will be highlighted. First off, you need to enter the following formula to any empty cell in your worksheet, you will be able to hide that cell later, if needed. The formula finds the number in a given range that is closest to the number you specify and returns the absolute value of that number (absolute value is the number without its sign): In the above formula, B2:D13 is your range of cells and 0 is the number for which you want to find the closest match. For example, if you are looking for a value closest to 5, the formula will change to: Note. This is an array formula, so you need to press Ctrl + Shift + Enter instead of a simple Enter stroke to complete it. And now, you create a conditional formatting rule with the following formula, where B3 is the top-right cell in your range and $C$2 in the cell with the above array formula: Please pay attention to the use of absolute references in the address of the cell containing the array formula ($C$2), because this cell is constant. Also, you need to replace 0 with the number for which you want to highlight the closest match. For example, if we wanted to highlight the value nearest to 5, the formula would change to: \n\n \n\n Example 2. Highlight a value closest to the given value, but NOT exact match In case you do not want to highlight the exact match, you need a different array formula that will find the closest value but ignore the exact match. For example, the following array formula finds the value closest to 0 in the specified range, but ignores zeroes, if any: Please remember to press Ctrl + Shift + Enter after you finished typing your array formula. The conditional formatting formula is the same as in the above example: However, since our array formula in cell C2 ignores the exact match, the conditional formatting rule ignores zeroes too and highlights the value 0.003 that is the closest match.\n\n If you want to find the value nearest to some other number in your Excel sheet, just replace \"0\" with the number you want both in the array and conditional formatting formulas. I hope the conditional formatting formulas you have learned in this tutorial will help you make sense of whatever project you are working on. If you need more examples, please check out the following articles:\n• How to change the row color based on a cell's value\n• Two ways to change background color based on cell value\n\nIf your conditional formatting rule is not working as expected, though the formula is apparently correct, do not get upset! Most likely it is not because of some weird bug in Excel conditional formatting, rather due to a tiny mistake, not evident at the first sight. Please try out 6 simple troubleshooting steps below and I'm sure you will get your formula to work:\n• Use absolute & relative cell addresses correctly. It's very difficult to deduce a general rule that will work in 100 per cent of cases. But most often you would use an absolute column (with $) and relative row (without $) in your cell references, e.g. . Please keep in mind that the formulas , and will produce different results. If you are not sure which one is correct in your case, you can try all : ) For more information, please see Relative and absolute cell references in Excel conditional formatting.\n• Verify the applied range. Check whether your conditional formatting rule applies to the correct range of cells. A rule of thumb is this - select all the cells / rows you want to format but do not include column headers.\n• Write the formula for the top-left cell. In conditional formatting rules, cell references are relative to the top-left most cell in the applied range. So, always write your conditional formatting formula for the 1st row with data. For example, if your data starts in row 2, you put to highlight cells with values equal to 10 in all the rows. A common mistake is to always use a reference to the first row (e.g. ). Please remember, you reference row 1 in the formula only if your table does not have headers and your data really starts in row 1. The most obvious indication of this case is when the rule is working, but formats values not in the rows it should.\n• Check the rule you created. Double-check the rule in the Conditional Formatting Rules Manager. Sometimes, for no reason at all, Microsoft Excel distorts the rule you have just created. So, if the rule is not working, go to Conditional Formatting > Manage Rules and check both the formula and the range it applies to. If you have copied the formula from the web or some other external source, make sure the straight quotes are used.\n• Adjust cell references when copying the rule. If you copy Excel conditional formatting using Format Painter, don't forget to adjust all cell references in the formula.\n• Split complex formulas into simple elements. If you use a complex Excel formula that includes several different functions, split it into simple elements and verify each function individually.\n\nAnd finally, if you've tried all the steps but your conditional formatting rule is still not working correctly, drop me a line in comments and we will try to fathom it out together :)\n\nIn my next article we are going to look into the capabilities of Excel conditional formatting for dates. See you next week and thanks for reading!"

Adding your own formula to a conditional formatting rule gives it a power boost to help you do things the built-in rules can’t do.\n\nFor example, let’s say you track your dental patients’ birthdays to see whose is coming up and then mark them as having received a Happy Birthday greeting from you.\n\nIn this worksheet, we see the information we want by using conditional formatting, driven by two rules that each contain a formula. The first rule, in column A, formats future birthdays, and the rule in column C formats cells as soon as “Y” is entered, indicating that the birthday greeting has been sent.\n\nTo create the first rule:\n• Select cells A2 through A7. Do this by dragging from A2 to A7.\n• On the Home tab, click Conditional Formatting > New Rule.\n• Under the Classic box, click to select Format only top or bottom ranked values, and change it to Use a formula to determine which cells to format.\n• In the next box, type the formula: =A2>TODAY() The formula uses the TODAY function to see if the dates in column A are greater than today (in the future). If so, the cells are formatted.\n• On the Format with box, click custom format.\n• In the Format Cells dialog box, click the Font tab.\n• In the Color box, select Red. In the Font style box, select Bold.\n• Click OK until the dialog boxes are closed.\n\nThe formatting is applied to column A.\n\nTo create the second rule:\n• On the Home tab, click Conditional Formatting > New Rule.\n• Under the Classic box, click to select Format only top or bottom ranked values, and change it to Use a formula to determine which cells to format.\n• In the next box, type the formula: =C2=\"Y\" The formula tests to see if the cells in column C contain “Y” (the quotation marks around the Y tell Excel that this is text). If so, the cells are formatted.\n• On the Format with box, click custom format.\n• At the top, click the Font tab.\n• In the Color box, select White. In the Font Style box, select Bold.\n• At the top, click the Fill tab, and then for Background color, select Green.\n• Click OK until the dialog boxes are closed.\n\nThe formatting is applied to column C."

        "document": "Conditional formatting in Excel allows you to quickly and automatically make sense of your data. Without manually scanning rows and columns of figures or text, conditional formatting enables you to easily highlight cells that meet your criteria.\n\nLet’s look at some beginner-level conditional formatting Excel examples:\n\nEXAMPLE 1: Using \"Greater than\"\n\nLet’s say your spreadsheet tracks customer purchases. You want to send a special holiday gift to all customers who spent over $10K.\n\nYou could, of course, manually scan the data for these records. But if your customer list is big, this could take a lot of time. Instead, set up a “rule.”\n• Highlight the column with the spend data (by simply clicking on the letter at the top of the column).\n• On the “home” ribbon (menu) at the top of your screen, click the down arrow on “Conditional Formatting.”\n• Choose “highlight cell rules” and select “Greater than…” In the box that pops up, enter 10,000.\n• Next choose the color you want your over-$10K customers to show up in. You can choose one of the default colors or get fancy with “custom format.” If you choose the fancy route, another box will pop up with all your choices. Go to the “color:” box and choose something from the existing options. Or, you can go crazy with “more colors,” which, if selected, will pop up a color wheel that lets you customize by simply tapping on the position on the wheel that suits you.\n\nLearn more and get your questions answered when you register for our live, online workshop: Getting the Most From Microsoft Excel.\n\nEXAMPLE 2: Finding figures \"Between\" two numbers (with two conditional formatting rules)\n\nNow, let’s complicate this a tiny bit. Let’s say you want your customers who spent between $5K and $9,999 to also get a gift — maybe something smaller. So, now you’ll have two rules for one column of data.\n• Again, highlight the column of spend data and select “Conditional Formatting.”\n• This time enter two amounts and a color, then OK. Now you should have your over-$10K customers in one color and your $5K-$9999 customers in another.\n\nEXAMPLE 3: Applying multiple conditional formatting rules at once\n\nThere are other ways to do this. Imagine you’ve got multiple levels (rather than just two). Set each rule one at a time…customers > $10K, customers > $9.5K, customers > $9, etc.…each segment with its own color. So, let’s try that now.\n• Again, highlight your column and go to the dropdown on “conditional formatting.” First click, “clear rules.”\n• Now begin setting your new rules by choosing “highlight cell rules” and “greater than….” Your first rule will be > $5,000 with a color; set another rule for > $5,500 and a color; set another rule for > $6,000, and so on up to > $10,000.\n• Because these rules overlap (people over $10K are also over $6K), you’ll need to put your rules in descending order either as you create them or by choosing “manage rules” under the “conditional formatting” dropdown. Once selected, all the rules that apply to that column will now show up. You’ll want to reorder them from largest to smallest and then click apply. Now you should see many colors.\n\nEXAMPLE 4: Highlight the entire line in your spreadsheet using conditional formatting\n\nYou can also use conditional formatting that checks the value in a particular cell and then formats an entire row. So rather than just highlight the cell with the data, the entire line (including the customer’s name in this case) will be highlighted.\n• To do this, select all the cells you want to check (not just the one column), and go to “conditional formatting.” (This selection should not include any headers you may have.)\n• Choose “new rule” and then click “use a formula to determine which cells to format.”\n• Enter your formula using the absolute reference to the cell you want to consider. (Absolute value means that you’re able to consider the actual number in that cell rather than any formula or calculation used to get that number.) Absolute value is assigned by adding a $ sign in front of the cell location.\n• In this example, let’s assume your spend numbers are in column F and the first customer shows up on line 2, your calculation would be =$F2>10,000.\n• Then press format, choose a color, click OK and you’ll go back to the original dialog box, where you’ll click OK again and now the highlighting should extend across the entire spreadsheet.\n\nExplore Excel conditional formatting. There are many, many ways to set rules for both text and numbers that help you “see” your data more easily, without having to calculate or scan manually."
