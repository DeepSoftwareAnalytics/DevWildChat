        "document": "A Complete Guide To Using SimPy For AI Simulations & Testing A Complete Guide To Using SimPy For AI Simulations & Testing SimPy is a Python-based simulation framework designed for process-based discrete-event simulations, making it a powerful tool for modeling real-world systems. By providing a simple yet flexible interface, SimPy enables users to define processes, events, and resources, making it ideal for simulating dynamic systems like queues, resource allocation, and scheduling. Its design emphasizes clarity and modularity, allowing even complex environments to be represented with ease. SimPy plays a critical role in AI, by helping in the creation of controlled, reproducible environments where algorithms can be tested and refined. This is particularly important in Reinforcement Learning (RL), where agents learn by interacting with environments and optimizing actions to maximize rewards. SimPy’s event-driven architecture aligns perfectly with the dynamic nature of RL tasks, enabling the simulation of episodic interactions. Similarly, in optimization problems, such as resource allocation and scheduling, SimPy helps model constraints and evaluate strategies efficiently. Hopefully, this article will serve you as a comprehensive guide to using SimPy for AI projects. We will explore the framework’s fundamentals and demonstrate how its features align with AI-driven tasks. From modeling RL environments to addressing complex optimization challenges, you’ll learn to harness SimPy effectively. Advanced sections will dive into multi-agent simulations (an area we’re conducting extensive experimentation in at Xinthe), integration with machine learning frameworks, and emerging trends in simulation-driven AI development.\n\nSimPy is built on the concept of discrete-event simulation, where events are modeled to occur at specific points on a simulated timeline. This allows users to simulate complex systems with precise control over processes, resources, and interactions. Here are its core components - Environment: The central component of SimPy, which acts as the simulation clock and manages the execution of all events. Process: Represents a sequence of actions or behaviors in the simulation, defined as Python generator functions. Event: Encapsulates occurrences in the simulation, like delays or resource requests. SimPy operates by advancing the simulation time incrementally, based on scheduled events. Processes yield control using yield statements, allowing other events to execute. This creates a highly efficient, cooperative multitasking system that ensures accurate sequencing of actions. Below is a simple example of a queue system where customers arrive at a counter and are served - import simpy\n\n\n\ndef customer(env, name, counter, service_time):\n\n \"\"\"A customer arrives, waits for a counter, and gets served.\"\"\"\n\n print(f'{name} arrives at {env.now:.2f}')\n\n with counter.request() as request:\n\n yield request # Wait for the counter to be available\n\n print(f'{name} starts service at {env.now:.2f}')\n\n yield env.timeout(service_time) # Service time\n\n print(f'{name} leaves at {env.now:.2f}')\n\n\n\ndef run_simulation():\n\n env = simpy.Environment()\n\n counter = simpy.Resource(env, capacity=2) # Counter with 2 available servers\n\n for i in range(5): # Simulate 5 customers\n\n env.process(customer(env, f'Customer {i+1}', counter, service_time=3))\n\n yield env.timeout(1) # Customers arrive every 1 unit of time\n\n env.run(until=15) # Run simulation for 15 units of time\n\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n run_simulation() Process: Each customer is modeled as a process with customer(). This basic example demonstrates how SimPy allows you to model a dynamic system with ease, laying the foundation for more complex simulations in AI projects.\n\nSimPy In AI Simulations — Why It Works SimPy is an excellent framework for AI simulations due to its ability to model dynamic, event-driven systems while providing scalability and customization. These features make it ideal for Reinforcement Learning (RL), optimization tasks, and other AI projects requiring detailed environment modeling. SimPy allows the creation of environments that evolve over time, enabling realistic simulations of dynamic systems. This capability is crucial for AI tasks where the state of the environment changes based on actions taken by the agent. For example, in RL, an agent interacts with the environment, observes changes, and receives rewards. SimPy can model such environments where events occur based on the agent’s actions or external triggers. import simpy\n\n\n\ndef environment_process(env, agent_action):\n\n \"\"\"Simulate an evolving environment where an agent acts.\"\"\"\n\n for step in range(5):\n\n print(f\"Environment state at time {env.now}: Step {step}\")\n\n yield env.timeout(1) # Simulate time passing\n\n agent_action(env, step) # Trigger agent's action\n\n\n\ndef agent_action(env, step):\n\n print(f\"Agent takes action at step {step} (time {env.now})\")\n\n\n\nenv = simpy.Environment()\n\nenv.process(environment_process(env, agent_action))\n\nenv.run(until=10) This example demonstrates an evolving environment where the agent’s action depends on the environment’s state. SimPy’s discrete-event architecture makes it highly suitable for AI tasks with decision points. For instance - Queue Management: An AI algorithm can decide which task to prioritize. Its event-based nature ensures precise control over timing and sequencing, which is essential for AI models relying on discrete interactions. SimPy’s flexibility allows users to create domain-specific simulations, whether for supply chain optimization, traffic flow analysis, or smart grid management. It can handle - Real-World Example: Multi-agent systems SimPy can simulate multiple agents interacting within a shared environment. Each agent can follow distinct behaviors, making it ideal for testing AI models in collaborative or competitive settings. By providing an efficient, event-driven foundation, SimPy ensures that AI simulations are both scalable and easily customizable, making it a powerful tool for developing and testing intelligent systems.\n\nSimPy provides an excellent framework for modeling environments tailored to Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks. Its event-driven simulation capabilities make it well-suited for episodic tasks, where an agent interacts with an environment to learn optimal actions through trial and error. SimPy can simulate episodic tasks where an agent observes states, takes actions, and receives rewards. Each interaction between the agent and the environment is modeled as a process, with time progression managed by SimPy’s Environment. Rewards: Feedback from the environment to guide learning. SimPy’s event-driven architecture ensures precise control over state transitions and action timing, critical for RL algorithms like Q-learning or Deep Q-Networks (DQNs). Defining states and rewards in SimPy involves creating a process where the environment evolves based on the agent’s actions. States are updated dynamically, and rewards are computed at each step to guide the agent’s learning. State: The agent’s position in the grid. Actions: Moving up, down, left, or right. Rewards: Positive for reaching the goal, negative for hitting obstacles. Below is a simplified example of combining SimPy with a basic Q-learning algorithm. import simpy\n\nimport numpy as np\n\nimport random\n\n\n\n# Define environment\n\nclass GridWorld:\n\n def __init__(self, env):\n\n self.env = env\n\n self.state = (0, 0) # Initial position\n\n self.goal = (4, 4)\n\n self.actions = ['up', 'down', 'left', 'right']\n\n self.rewards = {(4, 4): 10} # Goal reward\n\n\n\n def step(self, action):\n\n x, y = self.state\n\n if action == 'up':\n\n x = max(0, x - 1)\n\n elif action == 'down':\n\n x = min(4, x + 1)\n\n elif action == 'left':\n\n y = max(0, y - 1)\n\n elif action == 'right':\n\n y = min(4, y + 1)\n\n self.state = (x, y)\n\n reward = self.rewards.get(self.state, -1) # Default penalty\n\n done = self.state == self.goal\n\n return self.state, reward, done\n\n\n\n# Define Q-learning agent\n\nclass QLearningAgent:\n\n def __init__(self, actions, alpha=0.1, gamma=0.9, epsilon=0.1):\n\n self.q_table = {}\n\n self.actions = actions\n\n self.alpha = alpha\n\n self.gamma = gamma\n\n self.epsilon = epsilon\n\n\n\n def choose_action(self, state):\n\n if random.uniform(0, 1) < self.epsilon:\n\n return random.choice(self.actions)\n\n return max(self.actions, key=lambda a: self.q_table.get((state, a), 0))\n\n\n\n def update(self, state, action, reward, next_state):\n\n q_predict = self.q_table.get((state, action), 0)\n\n q_target = reward + self.gamma * max(\n\n [self.q_table.get((next_state, a), 0) for a in self.actions], default=0)\n\n self.q_table[(state, action)] = q_predict + self.alpha * (q_target - q_predict)\n\n\n\n# Simulation\n\ndef rl_simulation(env, grid_world, agent):\n\n while True:\n\n state = grid_world.state\n\n action = agent.choose_action(state)\n\n next_state, reward, done = grid_world.step(action)\n\n agent.update(state, action, reward, next_state)\n\n if done:\n\n break\n\n yield env.timeout(1) # Simulate time step\n\n\n\nenv = simpy.Environment()\n\ngrid_world = GridWorld(env)\n\nagent = QLearningAgent(grid_world.actions)\n\nenv.process(rl_simulation(env, grid_world, agent))\n\nenv.run(until=50)\n\n\n\n# Output learned Q-values\n\nprint(\"Learned Q-values:\", agent.q_table) SimPy provides a natural framework for episodic RL tasks by modeling dynamic environments and enabling state-action-reward loops. By integrating SimPy with RL algorithms, you can build highly customizable simulation environments for testing and training AI agents.\n\nSimPy’s ability to simulate resource constraints and complex interactions makes it an excellent tool for tackling optimization problems. Whether you’re managing CPU cycles, network bandwidth, or task scheduling, SimPy provides the flexibility to model and evaluate solutions efficiently. In optimization problems, resources like CPU, memory, or bandwidth often need to be allocated dynamically among competing tasks. SimPy’s Resource and PriorityResource classes are designed to handle these scenarios, ensuring fair and efficient resource distribution. SimPy can model and simulate scheduling problems, such as - Job Allocation: Assigning jobs to workers based on priority or deadline. SimPy’s event-driven framework makes it ideal for simulating queue dynamics, prioritization, and task dependencies in scheduling systems. Here’s an example of using SimPy to simulate a CPU resource allocation scenario for task scheduling. import simpy\n\nimport random\n\n\n\nclass Task:\n\n def __init__(self, env, name, cpu, execution_time, cpu_resource):\n\n self.env = env\n\n self.name = name\n\n self.cpu = cpu # Required CPU cycles\n\n self.execution_time = execution_time\n\n self.cpu_resource = cpu_resource\n\n self.process = env.process(self.run())\n\n\n\n def run(self):\n\n print(f\"{self.name} requesting {self.cpu} CPU at {self.env.now}\")\n\n with self.cpu_resource.request() as req:\n\n yield req # Wait for CPU resource\n\n print(f\"{self.name} acquired CPU at {self.env.now}\")\n\n yield self.env.timeout(self.execution_time) # Simulate execution time\n\n print(f\"{self.name} completed at {self.env.now}\")\n\n\n\ndef generate_tasks(env, cpu_resource):\n\n for i in range(5): # Generate 5 tasks\n\n cpu = random.randint(1, 3) # CPU cycles required\n\n execution_time = random.randint(2, 5) # Time to execute\n\n Task(env, f\"Task-{i+1}\", cpu, execution_time, cpu_resource)\n\n yield env.timeout(1) # Delay between task arrivals\n\n\n\n# Simulation Environment\n\nenv = simpy.Environment()\n\ncpu_resource = simpy.Resource(env, capacity=2) # CPU resource with 2 cores\n\nenv.process(generate_tasks(env, cpu_resource))\n\nenv.run()\n\n\n\n# Output shows task allocation and completion Tasks wait for the resource if it’s fully utilized and proceed once it’s available. SimPy’s resource management capabilities make it a powerful tool for modeling and optimizing real-world systems with constrained resources. By simulating various scenarios, you can test and refine scheduling strategies before deploying them in production.\n\nSimPy’s capability to simulate complex environments aligns seamlessly with machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. By combining SimPy’s event-driven simulations with powerful ML libraries, you can create pipelines for training AI models, particularly in reinforcement learning (RL) and optimization tasks. SimPy can act as a dynamic environment generator for ML models. For instance - Reinforcement Learning (RL): SimPy provides the environment where agents interact and learn through trial and error. Optimization Models: SimPy-generated simulations can serve as input data for training machine learning models to predict or optimize outcomes. SimPy can communicate with ML frameworks by - Providing State Observations: SimPy updates the state of the environment, which is passed as input to the ML model. Reward Signals: SimPy calculates and returns rewards based on the agent’s actions. A common approach is using SimPy to generate environments where agents learn optimal policies through reinforcement learning. SimPy creates realistic scenarios, while the ML framework handles the learning process, adjusting model parameters based on rewards and penalties.\n• Code Example — SimPy With PyTorch For RL Below is a pipeline integrating SimPy for environment generation and PyTorch for training a simple RL agent. import simpy\n\nimport torch\n\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nimport torch.optim as optim\n\nimport random\n\n\n\n# Define the SimPy environment\n\nclass SimpleEnvironment:\n\n def __init__(self, env):\n\n self.env = env\n\n self.state = 0\n\n self.done = False\n\n\n\n def step(self, action):\n\n # Simulate environment dynamics\n\n reward = random.choice([1, -1]) if action == 1 else random.choice([0, -1])\n\n self.state += reward\n\n self.done = self.state >= 10 or self.state <= -10\n\n return self.state, reward, self.done\n\n\n\n# Define the RL model\n\nclass RLAgent(nn.Module):\n\n def __init__(self, state_size, action_size):\n\n super(RLAgent, self).__init__()\n\n self.fc = nn.Linear(state_size, action_size)\n\n\n\n def forward(self, x):\n\n return self.fc(x)\n\n\n\n# Training loop\n\ndef train_agent(env, agent, optimizer, episodes=100):\n\n for episode in range(episodes):\n\n state = torch.tensor([env.state], dtype=torch.float32)\n\n total_reward = 0\n\n\n\n while not env.done:\n\n action = torch.argmax(agent(state)).item() # Select action\n\n next_state, reward, done = env.step(action)\n\n next_state = torch.tensor([next_state], dtype=torch.float32)\n\n\n\n # Compute loss and backpropagate\n\n target = reward + 0.99 * torch.max(agent(next_state)).item()\n\n prediction = agent(state)[action]\n\n loss = (target - prediction) ** 2\n\n optimizer.zero_grad()\n\n loss.backward()\n\n optimizer.step()\n\n\n\n state = next_state\n\n total_reward += reward\n\n\n\n print(f\"Episode {episode + 1}: Total Reward = {total_reward}\")\n\n env.state, env.done = 0, False # Reset environment\n\n\n\n# Set up SimPy and PyTorch components\n\nsimpy_env = simpy.Environment()\n\nsimpy_env_model = SimpleEnvironment(simpy_env)\n\nagent = RLAgent(state_size=1, action_size=2) # 2 actions: 0 or 1\n\noptimizer = optim.Adam(agent.parameters(), lr=0.01)\n\n\n\n# Train the RL agent\n\ntrain_agent(simpy_env_model, agent, episodes=10) The SimpleEnvironment class models a state and provides a step function for RL interactions. The RLAgent is a simple neural network predicting the best action for a given state. The agent interacts with the SimPy environment, receives rewards, and updates its parameters using gradient descent. SimPy handles the simulation dynamics, while PyTorch manages the agent’s learning process. Integrating SimPy with PyTorch or TensorFlow enables advanced applications like RL and optimization tasks. This pipeline demonstrates how simulations and AI frameworks can work together to solve real-world problems. Advanced Use Cases Of SimPy In AI SimPy’s flexibility and process-based simulation capabilities make it a powerful tool for modeling advanced systems. From multi-agent environments to complex system dynamics, SimPy provides a robust foundation for exploring real-world AI challenges. SimPy can model scenarios involving multiple agents, each acting independently or collaboratively - Competitive Scenarios: Simulate agents competing for limited resources, such as bots in a warehouse or traders in a stock market. Cooperative Scenarios: Model teamwork dynamics, such as drones collaborating to deliver packages or agents optimizing a shared objective. Below is an example where multiple vehicles (agents) navigate a traffic intersection. import simpy\n\nimport random\n\n\n\ndef vehicle(env, name, intersection):\n\n \"\"\"Simulates a vehicle approaching and crossing an intersection.\"\"\"\n\n print(f'{name} approaching intersection at {env.now}')\n\n with intersection.request() as req:\n\n yield req\n\n print(f'{name} crossing intersection at {env.now}')\n\n yield env.timeout(random.randint(2, 5))\n\n print(f'{name} cleared intersection at {env.now}')\n\n\n\ndef setup_traffic(env, num_vehicles, intersection):\n\n \"\"\"Sets up multiple vehicles arriving at random intervals.\"\"\"\n\n for i in range(num_vehicles):\n\n env.process(vehicle(env, f'Vehicle {i + 1}', intersection))\n\n yield env.timeout(random.randint(1, 3))\n\n\n\n# Create SimPy environment\n\nenv = simpy.Environment()\n\n\n\n# Define a shared resource (intersection)\n\nintersection = simpy.Resource(env, capacity=1)\n\n\n\n# Start traffic simulation\n\nenv.process(setup_traffic(env, num_vehicles=5, intersection=intersection))\n\n\n\n# Run the simulation\n\nenv.run() Vehicles As Agents: Each vehicle is a SimPy process that requests access to the intersection. Intersection As A Shared Resource: Only one vehicle can cross the intersection at a time (capacity=1). Random Behavior: Vehicles arrive at random intervals and take random times to cross the intersection. def supplier(env, warehouse, supply_interval):\n\n \"\"\"Replenishes warehouse inventory at regular intervals.\"\"\"\n\n while True:\n\n yield env.timeout(supply_interval)\n\n warehouse.level += 50\n\n print(f'Supplier delivered goods at {env.now}, stock: {warehouse.level}')\n\n\n\ndef customer(env, warehouse, demand_rate):\n\n \"\"\"Customer process consuming goods.\"\"\"\n\n while True:\n\n yield env.timeout(random.randint(1, demand_rate))\n\n if warehouse.level > 0:\n\n warehouse.level -= 1\n\n print(f'Customer purchased at {env.now}, stock: {warehouse.level}')\n\n else:\n\n print(f'Customer left unsatisfied at {env.now}, stock: {warehouse.level}')\n\n\n\n# Create SimPy environment\n\nenv = simpy.Environment()\n\n\n\n# Define warehouse inventory as a shared resource\n\nwarehouse = simpy.Container(env, init=100, capacity=200)\n\n\n\n# Start supplier and customer processes\n\nenv.process(supplier(env, warehouse, supply_interval=10))\n\nenv.process(customer(env, warehouse, demand_rate=2))\n\n\n\n# Run the simulation\n\nenv.run(until=50) Complex Systems: Ideal for simulating real-world, multi-component systems like traffic, supply chains, and energy grids. Scalability: SimPy allows scaling simulations to include numerous agents with customizable interactions, making it a robust tool for advanced AI applications.\n\nSimPy is a powerful simulation framework, but like any tool, it has its challenges and limitations. Understanding these can help developers optimize their workflows and avoid common pitfalls. SimPy excels in small to medium-sized simulations but may encounter bottlenecks as complexity increases - Event Overhead: Large-scale simulations with thousands of events can strain performance, particularly when simulating detailed, high-frequency interactions. Memory Usage: Each process and resource in SimPy consumes memory, which can become a limiting factor in large-scale simulations. Single-Threaded Execution: SimPy runs on a single thread, making it challenging to leverage multi-core systems for parallelism. Distributed SimPy Instances: Split the simulation into smaller, independent parts and run them on distributed nodes. Frameworks like Ray or Dask can be used for orchestration. Simplify Processes: Optimize the simulation by reducing event granularity and simplifying resource management. Debugging Complex Processes: Tracking interactions between multiple agents or processes can be challenging, especially in long-running simulations. Use Matplotlib or similar libraries to create custom visualizations. Integrate tools like NetworkX for visualizing process relationships or resource allocation. Leverage SimPy’s event log for debugging by writing event-specific logs to files for post-simulation analysis. The following code demonstrates how to visualize customer wait times in a queue using Matplotlib - import simpy\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n\n\nwait_times = []\n\n\n\ndef customer(env, name, counter):\n\n \"\"\"Simulates customer arrival and service.\"\"\"\n\n arrival_time = env.now\n\n with counter.request() as req:\n\n yield req\n\n service_time = 2\n\n yield env.timeout(service_time)\n\n wait_times.append(env.now - arrival_time)\n\n\n\ndef setup(env, num_customers, counter):\n\n \"\"\"Spawns customers at regular intervals.\"\"\"\n\n for i in range(num_customers):\n\n env.process(customer(env, f'Customer {i+1}', counter))\n\n yield env.timeout(1)\n\n\n\n# SimPy environment\n\nenv = simpy.Environment()\n\ncounter = simpy.Resource(env, capacity=1)\n\nenv.process(setup(env, num_customers=10, counter=counter))\n\nenv.run()\n\n\n\n# Visualizing wait times\n\nplt.bar(range(len(wait_times)), wait_times)\n\nplt.xlabel('Customer')\n\nplt.ylabel('Wait Time (seconds)')\n\nplt.title('Customer Wait Times in Queue')\n\nplt.show() Scalability: Break down large simulations into manageable components or explore distributed frameworks for scaling. Visualization: Use external tools like Matplotlib or NetworkX to create meaningful visualizations. Debugging: Maintain detailed event logs and adopt modular design to simplify debugging and testing. These workarounds help mitigate SimPy’s limitations, enabling its effective use in even complex AI simulations.\n\nSimPy continues to be a versatile framework for AI simulations, but its potential can be amplified with emerging technologies and innovative approaches. Here are some future directions worth exploring - Hosting SimPy simulations in cloud environments like AWS or Google Cloud can enable scalability and real-time processing for large-scale experiments. By leveraging cloud resources, researchers can parallelize multiple simulation runs, accelerating tasks like hyperparameter tuning in reinforcement learning. Combining SimPy with IoT and edge devices can enable real-time system testing, such as dynamic resource allocation in smart grids or traffic management systems. Integrating SimPy with message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) can simulate real-world asynchronous events in distributed systems. Code Snippet: Example of integrating SimPy with cloud-based tools # Example workflow using Google Cloud Pub/Sub for event-based simulation\n\nfrom google.cloud import pubsub_v1\n\nimport simpy\n\n\n\ndef cloud_event_listener(env, topic_path):\n\n # Simulates receiving events from a cloud-based topic\n\n subscriber = pubsub_v1.SubscriberClient()\n\n with subscriber:\n\n response = subscriber.pull(subscription=topic_path, max_messages=10)\n\n for msg in response.received_messages:\n\n print(f\"Event at {env.now}: {msg.message.data}\")\n\n env.timeout(1) # Simulate processing time\n\n\n\nenv = simpy.Environment()\n\nenv.process(cloud_event_listener(env, \"projects/my-project/subscriptions/my-topic\"))\n\nenv.run(until=20) The integration of AI models like GPT or reinforcement learning agents can assist in designing complex SimPy environments. Example: AI could automatically generate realistic agent behaviors or define optimal simulation parameters based on prior runs. AI can analyze simulation outputs in real time and adjust parameters to explore edge cases or optimize outcomes. Emerging frameworks, such as Ray or RLlib, can complement SimPy by managing distributed simulations and resource allocation. Encouraging contributions to SimPy’s open-source ecosystem can address its current limitations, such as visualization tools and distributed processing capabilities. Developers can contribute plug-ins for niche domains, such as healthcare simulations or autonomous systems testing. Develop tutorials or case studies to help the community leverage SimPy for innovative AI applications. SimPy’s adaptability and simplicity make it a powerful tool for AI simulations. As emerging trends like cloud computing and AI-driven automation continue to evolve, SimPy’s role in shaping robust, scalable systems is only poised to grow."

        "document": "SimPy is a discrete-event simulation library. The behavior of active components (like vehicles, customers or messages) is modeled with processes. All processes live in an environment. They interact with the environment and with each other via events.\n\nProcesses are described by simple Python generators. You can call them process function or process method, depending on whether it is a normal function or method of a class. During their lifetime, they create events and them in order to wait for them to occur.\n\nWhen a process yields an event, the process gets suspended. SimPy resumes the process, when the event occurs (we say that the event is processed). Multiple processes can wait for the same event. SimPy resumes them in the same order in which they yielded that event.\n\nAn important event type is the . Events of this type occur (are processed) after a certain amount of (simulated) time has passed. They allow a process to sleep (or hold its state) for the given time. A and all other events can be created by calling the appropriate method of the that the process lives in ( for example).\n\nOur first example will be a car process. The car will alternately drive and park for a while. When it starts driving (or parking), it will print the current simulation time. Our car process requires a reference to an ( ) in order to create new events. The car’s behavior is described in an infinite loop. Remember, this function is a generator. Though it will never terminate, it will pass the control flow back to the simulation once a statement is reached. Once the yielded event is processed (“it occurs”), the simulation will resume the function at this statement. As I said before, our car switches between the states parking and driving. It announces its new state by printing a message and the current simulation time (as returned by the property). It then calls the factory function to create a event. This event describes the point in time the car is done parking (or driving, respectively). By yielding the event, it signals the simulation that it wants to wait for the event to occur. Now that the behavior of our car has been modeled, lets create an instance of it and see how it behaves: The first thing we need to do is to create an instance of . This instance is passed into our car process function. Calling it creates a process generator that needs to be started and added to the environment via . Note, that at this time, none of the code of our process function is being executed. Its execution is merely scheduled at the current simulation time. The returned by can be used for process interactions (we will cover that in the next section, so we will ignore it for now). Finally, we start the simulation by calling and passing an end time to it."

It finds applications in diverse domains, including but not limited to operations research, supply chain management, healthcare systems, transportation, and finance. DES allows data scientists to simulate complex scenarios, analyze system behaviors under various conditions, and derive insights that aid in strategic planning and decision-making.\n\nThis post aims to provide an introduction to Discrete Event Simulation from the perspective of a data scientist. Specifically, it focuses on leveraging Python’s Simpy library to implement DES models. The primary goal is to illustrate how Simpy can be a valuable asset in a data scientist’s toolkit for simulating and analyzing dynamic systems, offering a hands-on approach to understand the concept of DES and its practical applications.\n\nThroughout this post, we will explore the fundamental concepts behind DES, dive into the functionalities of Simpy, and showcase examples demonstrating how this combination can be instrumental in modeling and analyzing real-world systems. By the end, you should gain insights into the potential of DES using Simpy and its relevance in the realm of data science.\n\nLet’s embark on this journey into the world of Discrete Event Simulation with Python’s Simpy library, where data science meets the simulation of dynamic systems for insightful analysis and decision-making.\n\nDiscrete Event Simulation (DES) operates on the premise of modeling dynamic systems by tracking individual events as they occur at distinct points in time. It’s a powerful technique employed to simulate and analyze systems where changes occur instantaneously, focusing on key events that drive system behavior.\n\nAt its core, DES revolves around entities, events, the simulation clock, and queues.\n• Entities represent the objects or elements within the system under observation.\n• Events, triggered by entities, denote occurrences that affect the system’s state or condition.\n• The simulation clock marks discrete instances when these events transpire, driving the progression of time within the simulated environment.\n• Queues play a pivotal role in managing and processing entities, representing waiting lines or buffers where entities await processing or service.\n\nIf we go one abstraction layer up, common DES components can be classified into sources, servers (with or withtout queues) and sinks.\n• Sources are responsible of producing entities and inserting them into the simulating system. Times between arrival and amount of entities per arrival are common parameters of sources.\n• Servers are in charge of delaying entities in the system for a given time period defined usually as a processing time.\n• Sinks are used to remove entities from the simlating system and are useful to collect information about times spend by entities and performance of the overall system.\n\nDES finds wide-ranging applications in modeling real-world systems across diverse domains. For instance, in manufacturing, DES facilitates the optimization of production lines by simulating the movement of materials or resources through different stages of the manufacturing process. In logistics and transportation, DES helps in modeling traffic flow, allowing analysts to simulate congestion scenarios or evaluate route optimization strategies.\n\nMoreover, DES proves invaluable in healthcare systems for analyzing patient flow through hospitals or clinics, optimizing resource allocation, and evaluating the impact of different operational strategies. Financial institutions leverage DES to model transaction processing, simulate market behavior, or evaluate risk management strategies.\n\nUnderstanding the core concepts of DES forms the foundation for constructing models that emulate the behavior of real-world systems. The versatility of DES in simulating various scenarios and its applicability across industries underscores its significance in data science for modeling complex dynamic systems and deriving insights that aid in decision-making and system optimization.\n• Workflow Modeling: DES enables modeling complex workflows within systems, aiding in understanding process dynamics. For instance, in software development, DES can simulate the flow of tasks in an Agile environment, allowing for optimization of development processes.\n• Process Optimization: DES can be used to optimize manufacturing processes, supply chain operations, or service systems. By simulating different scenarios, DES helps identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies, thereby enabling data-driven process improvements.\n• Resource Allocation Analysis: DES aids in analyzing resource allocation strategies. For instance, in healthcare, it can model patient flow in hospitals to optimize staff allocation or bed utilization.\n• System Performance Evaluation: Consider a data center where DES can model server operations, traffic loads, and network congestion. Utilizing DES allows for sophisticated analysis, aiding in predicting system performance under varying workloads.\n• Predictive Modeling: DES serves as a predictive modeling tool. For instance, in predictive maintenance, DES can simulate equipment failure scenarios, enabling proactive maintenance scheduling based on predicted failures.\n• Cost-Effective Experimentation: DES allows for cost-effective experimentation. I can be used to simulate different strategies or scenarios without real-world implementation, reducing risks and costs associated with trial and error.\n\nWhile DES offers powerful capabilities, it’s important to mention the challenges and limitations when employing this approach.\n• Complexity in Model Construction: Building DES models can be intricate, especially when modeling complex systems with numerous interacting entities and events. Handling intricate interactions and dependencies while ensuring model accuracy might pose challenges.\n• Computational Resource Intensity: Simulating large-scale systems using DES might require substantial computational resources. Processing time and memory usage may increase significantly, impacting the feasibility of simulating extensive scenarios.\n• Continuous vs. Discrete Systems: DES is suitable for modeling systems with discrete events. However, for systems where events occur continuously or in a continuous manner (e.g., physical systems with continuous processes), other simulation techniques like continuous simulation or differential equations might be more appropriate.\n\nUnderstanding the challenges and limitations of employing DES with Simpy is crucial. Mitigating challenges through model abstraction, optimization techniques, and recognizing scenarios where DES might not be the optimal solution ensures more informed decision-making in selecting appropriate simulation methodologies.\n\nIn this set of examples, we’ll explore the Simpy library and its main objects. It’s not the most intuitive library, but not because of the design or quality of it, but due to the non-trivial problem that it aims to solve. Discrete Event Simulation with Python is not an easy task, and I’m far from being an expert in this matter, so I apologize in advance if I make a wrong use of the Simpy library or the concepts behind it.\n\nEasiest way to setup simpy is to install it using `pip` with the following command.\n\nThis first example is just to ilustrate how to start a simulation and what Simpy needs in order to make its magic.\n\nFirst of all, we need to import and install simpy. Then, to make an event ocurr we need to use python generators. The explanation of generators is far beyond the scope of this post but I strongly recommend to take a look at the official python documentation.\n\nThe way I like to think about generators in this specific scenario is that they will freeze the excecution until a condition is passed. In our case, this conditions is the env.timeout() event, which internally makes the simulation time to advance. After this timeout is finished, the excecution continues from where it was interrupted.\n\nAn alternative to python functions, is to use python classes (which I personally prefer). This allows us to build much more “interpretable” models where the simulation objects represents real objects.\n\nIn this example, we’ll make a process to run uninterruptedly and to let simpy enviroment finish the simulation when a maximum time is reached. This kind of simulation it’s mostly use to emulate real time dependent process and to evaluate it’s progress over time.\n\nIn this example, we simulate a machine that processes products in a queue or production plan. The processing time of each product is define by a random variable and sampled from a triangular distribution with a given minimum, mode and maximum parameters.\n\nThe policy used to select the next product can be of three different types:\n• FIFO (first in, first out)\n• LIFO (last in, first out)\n\nThe code necesary to run the previous example could be as follow:\n\nAnd the outputs for each queue policy can be seen in the next block.\n\nYou might be thinking that, with what has been presented so far, it is not enough to apply this tool and analyze highly complex issues as those encountered in real-life scenarios. As I mentioned at the beginning, this post does not aim to demonstrate the use of DES in a real application context, but rather to introduce and ignite interest in the world of simulation, which, in my humble opinion, is an undervalued technique hiding immense potential\n\nI’ll leave you some examples of systems that I could cover in future posts or maybe you could try to implement.\n\nIn conclusion, this post has provided valuable insights into Discrete Event Simulation (DES) and its applications in data science, particularly in utilizing Python’s Simpy library for modeling dynamic systems.\n• Understanding the Essence: We explored the fundamental concepts behind DES, including entities, events, simulation clocks, and queues. These concepts form the backbone of constructing models that replicate real-world system behaviors.\n• Applications: We highlighted practical applications of DES in data science, such as modeling workflows, optimizing processes, and analyzing resource allocation. DES with Simpy emerges as a potent tool for predictive modeling and strategic decision-making.\n• Challenges and Considerations: Acknowledging the challenges and limitations of employing DES is vital. From model complexity to computational resource intensity, data scientists can anticipate hurdles and strategize mitigation approaches effectively.\n\nThe Importance of DES in Data Science\n\nUnderstanding DES is pivotal for data scientists, enabling them to model and simulate complex systems, derive insights, and make informed decisions. Simpy, as a powerful tool, empowers data scientists to implement DES models effectively, allowing for experimentation and prediction in various domains of data science.\n\nAs we conclude, I encourage further exploration and experimentation with DES and Simpy. Delving deeper into DES methodologies and harnessing the functionalities of Simpy can open doors to innovative solutions, optimization strategies, and predictive modeling in diverse industries.\n\nIncorporating DES with Simpy into your data science toolkit not only facilitates better understanding but also empowers you to tackle complex real-world problems with confidence and precision."

When these systems are not optimized, their inefficiency can lead to countless unhappy customers and hours of wasted time. In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to use Python’s framework to create virtual simulations that will help you solve problems like these.\n\nIn this tutorial, you’ll learn how to:\n• Design and run a real-world simulation in Python with\n\nIn this tutorial, you’ll create a simulation for a local movie theater. Your goal is to provide the manager with a script to help find the optimal number of employees to have on staff. You can download the source code for this script by clicking on the link below:\n\nA simulation is a representation of a real-world system. One can use mathematical or computational models of this system to study how it works, or what happens when parts of it are changed. Simulations are used in airports, restaurants, mechanics, government agencies, and many other systems where poor resource allocation can lead to congestion, customer dissatisfaction, and critical transportation delays. A system can be any environment where things happen. Examples of real-world systems include car washes, banks, manufacturing plants, airports, post offices, call centers, and more. These systems have agents that undergo processes within them. For instance:\n• A car wash will have cars go through the washing process.\n• An airport will have passengers go through the security check process.\n• A call center will have customers go through the process of speaking with a telemarketer. This relationship is summed up in the table below: Understanding the processes that agents go through within a system is an important component of logistical planning, especially for large-scale organizations. For example, an airport can see passenger wait times at a security checkpoint skyrocket if there aren’t enough workers that day. Similarly, time-sensitive mail can be delayed by days (or even weeks) if it isn’t routed properly. These instances of congestion can have real-life consequences on time and money, so it’s important to be able to model these processes beforehand. This gives you an idea of where the system might run into problems and how resources should be allocated ahead of time to solve those problems in the most efficient way possible.\n\nIn Python, you can use the framework for event simulation. First, take a quick look at how a simulated process would run in Python. Below is a code snippet from a simulation of a security checkpoint system. The following three lines of code set up the environment, pass all necessary functions, and run the simulation: The first line of code above establishes the environment. You’ll do this by assigning to the desired variable. Here, it’s simply named . This tells to create an environment object named that will manage the simulation time and move the simulation through each subsequent time step. Once you have your environment established, you’ll pass in all of the variables that will act as your parameters. These are the things you can vary to see how the system will react to changes. For this security checkpoint system, you’re using the following parameters:\n• : the environment object to schedule and process events\n• the length of time it takes to check a passenger’s ID\n• : the rate at which passengers arrive at the queue Then, it’s time to run the simulation! You can do this by calling and specifying how long you want the simulation to run for. The simulation runs in minutes, so this sample code will run the simulation for 10 real-time minutes. Note: Don’t worry! You won’t have to wait 10 actual minutes for the simulation to finish. Because simulation gives you a virtual look at a real-time process, those 10 minutes will pass in mere seconds on the computer. To recap, here are the three steps to running a simulation in Python: But there’s a lot more going on underneath the hood! You’ll need to understand how to choose those parameters, and you’ll have to define all the functions that will be called when the simulation is run.\n\nHow to Get Started With There are a few to-dos you should check off your list before creating simulations in Python. The first thing you need to do is make sure you have a solid understanding of Python basics. In particular, you’ll need to have a good grasp of classes and generators. Note: If you need to freshen up on these topics, then check out Intro to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python and Introduction to Python Generators. These are crucial pieces of the simulation process, so you’ll need to understand them before moving forward. The next thing you’ll want to do is install the required package. The main framework you’ll be using is . This is the core package that will create, manage, and run your simulation. You can install it with : You’ll also need a few built-in Python modules. You’ll use the module to calculate average wait times and the module to generate random numbers. These come as part of the Python standard library, so you don’t need to install anything new. Finally, you’ll need to choose how you want to run your simulation. In general, you can choose one of two options:\n• Run it interactively: Use a Jupyter Notebook, where each code block will contain its own class or function definition. The output will be displayed at the bottom of the notebook.\n• Run it in the shell: Save your simulation as a file and tell Python to run it in your terminal. The output will be printed directly to the console. Choose whichever method you’re most comfortable with! The outcome should be the same. Throughout this tutorial, you’ll see references to a standalone file named . As you move through this tutorial, the code blocks will reference to help you keep track of how all the pieces fit together. For your reference, you can access the full code for at the link below: Download Code: Click here to download the code you’ll use to learn about SimPy in this tutorial. Feel free to save the file and follow along in your favorite editor!\n\nHow to Simulate With the Package The first step to running a simulation in is to choose a process to model. Simulation is all about creating a virtual environment to reflect a real-world system. In that same spirit, you’ll “simulate” a situation for your simulation! Imagine you’ve been hired to help the manager for a small, local movie theater. The theater has been receiving poor reviews due to their long wait times. The manager, who is just as concerned about cost as he is about customer satisfaction, can only afford to keep so many employees on staff. The manager is particularly worried about what chaos can unfold once those blockbusters start coming out: lines wrapping around the theater, employees stretched to their limit, angry moviegoers missing the opening scenes… This is definitely a situation to avoid! After checking the reviews, the manager was able to determine that a given moviegoer to their theater is willing to spend at most 10 minutes from the time they arrive until the time they put their butt in a seat. In other words, the average wait time for a night at the theater needs to be 10 minutes or less. The manager has asked for your help to figure out a solution to getting customer wait times under this 10 minute requirement. Before you write out a single line of code, it’s important that you first figure out how your process would run in real life. This is to ensure that, when you pass it along to the machine, the process is an accurate reflection of what customers will really experience. Here’s how you might think through the steps a moviegoer might take to write out your algorithm:\n• Arrive at the theater, get in line, and wait to purchase a ticket.\n• Wait in line to have the ticket checked.\n• Get the ticket checked by an usher.\n• Choose whether or not to get in line for the concession stand:\n• If they get in line, then they purchase food.\n• If they don’t get in line, then they skip to the last step. This is a step-by-step iteration for a moviegoer who purchases their ticket at the theater box office. You can already see which parts of this process can be controlled. You can affect how long a customer is waiting by having more cashiers available at the box office. There are also parts of the process that can’t be controlled, like the very first step. You can’t control how many customers will arrive, or how quickly they’ll do so. You can make a guess, but you can’t simply choose a number, because that would be a poor reflection of reality. For this parameter, the best thing you can do is use available data to determine an appropriate arrival time. Note: Using historical data ensures that the solution you find will accurately reflect what you can expect to see in real life. With these things in mind, it’s time to build your simulation! Before you start building your simulation, you need to make sure that your development environment is properly configured. The very first thing you’ll want to do is import the necessary packages. You can do this by declaring statements at the top of your file: These are the main libraries you’ll use to build a script for the theater manager. Remember, the goal is to find the optimal number of employees that gives an average wait time of less than 10 minutes. To do this, you’ll need to collect the length of time that it takes for each moviegoer to make it to their seats. The next step is to declare a list to hold these times: This list will contain the total amount of time each moviegoer spends moving through the theater, from arrival to sitting in their seat. You declare this list at the very top of the file so that you can use it inside any function you define later on. The first part of the simulation you’ll want to build is the blueprint for the system. This is going to be the overall environment inside which things happen, and people or objects move from one place to another. Remember, an environment can be one of many different systems, like a bank, a car wash, or a security checkpoint. In this case, the environment is a movie theater, so that will be the name of your class: Now it’s time to think through the parts of a movie theater. Of course, there’s the theater itself, which is what you’ve called your environment. Later, you’ll explicitly declare the theater as an actual using one of the functions. For now, call it for short and add it to the class definition: Alright, what else might there be in a theater? You can figure this out by thinking through the simulation algorithm you planned out earlier. When a moviegoer arrives, they’ll need to get in line at the box office, where a cashier will be waiting to help them out. Now you’ve discovered two things about the theater environment:\n• Moviegoers can purchase tickets from them. Cashiers are a resource that the theater makes available to its customers, and they help moviegoers through the process of purchasing a ticket. Right now, you don’t know how many cashiers are available in the simulated theater. In fact, that’s the very problem you’re trying to solve. How do wait times change, depending on the number of cashiers working on a given night? You can go ahead and call this unknown variable . The exact value this variable will take can be sorted out later. For now, just know that it’s an indispensable part of the theater environment. Add it to the class definition: Here, you add the new parameter to your definition. Then, you create a resource and use to declare how many can be in this environment at any given time. Note: In , resources are the parts of the environment ( ) that are limited in number. Using one of them takes time, and only so many ( ) are available to be used at once. There’s one more step that you’ll need to take. A cashier isn’t going to purchase a ticket for themselves, right? They’re going to help the moviegoer! Again, you know that this process of purchasing a ticket is going to take a certain amount of time. But just how much time? Say you’ve asked the manager for historical data on the theater, like employee performance reviews or ticket purchase receipts. Based on this data, you’ve learned that it takes, on average, between 1 and 2 minutes to issue a ticket at the box office. How do you get to mimic this behavior? It only takes one line of code: tells to trigger an event after a certain amount of time has passed. In this case, the event is that a ticket was purchased. The time this takes could be one minute, two minutes, or three minutes. You want each moviegoer to spend a different amount of time at the cashier. To do this, you use to choose a random number between the given low and high values. Then, for each moviegoer, the simulation will wait for the chosen amount of time. Let’s wrap this up in a tidy function and add it to the class definition: The one initiating the event in is the , so they must be passed as a required argument. Note: You’ll see how the moviegoer actually purchases the ticket in the next section! That’s it! You’ve selected a time-bound resource, defined its related process, and codified this in your class definition. For this tutorial, there are two more resources you’ll need to declare: After checking the data the manager sent over, you determine that servers take anywhere between 1 and 5 minutes to complete an order. In addition, ushers are remarkably fast at checking tickets, with an average speed of 3 seconds! You’ll need to add these resources to your class and define the corresponding functions and . Can you figure out what the code should look like? When you’ve got an idea, you can expand the code block below to check your understanding: Take a close look at the new resources and functions. Notice how they follow the same format as described above. uses to generate a random number between 1 and 5 minutes, representing the time it would take a moviegoer to place an order and receive their food. The time delay for is a bit different because the ushers only take 3 seconds. Since works in minutes, this value needs to be passed as a fraction of a minute, or . Alright, you’ve set up the environment by defining a class. You have resources and processes. Now you need a to use them. When a arrives at the theater, they’ll request a resource, wait for its process to complete, and then leave. You’ll create a function, called , to keep track of this: There are three arguments passed to this function:\n• : The will be controlled by the environment, so you’ll pass this as the first argument.\n• : This variable tracks each person as they move through the system.\n• : This parameter gives you access to the processes you defined in the overall class definition. You also declare a variable to hold the time at which each arrives at the theater. You can get this time using the call to . You’ll want each of the processes from your to have corresponding requests in . For example, the first process in the class is , which uses a resource. The will need to make a request to the resource to help them through the process. Here’s a table to summarize this: The cashier is a shared resource, which means that many moviegoers will use the same cashier. However, a cashier can only help one moviegoer at a time, so you’ll need to include some waiting behavior in your code. Here’s how that works:\n• : waits for a to become available if all are currently in use. To learn more about the keyword, check out How to Use Generators and yield in Python.\n• : uses an available to complete the given process. In this case, that’s to purchase a ticket with a call to . After a resource is used, it must be freed up for the next agent to use. You could do this explicitly with , but in the code above, you use a statement instead. This shortcut tells the simulation to automatically release the resource once the process is complete. In other words, once the ticket is bought, the will leave, and the cashier will automatically be ready to take the next customer. When a cashier is freed up, the will spend some time buying their ticket. tells the simulation to go to the instance and run the process on this . The will repeat this request, use, release cycle to have their ticket checked: Here, the structure for the code is the same. Then, there’s the optional step of buying food from the concession stand. You can’t know whether a moviegoer will want to purchase snacks and drinks. One way to deal with this uncertainty is to introduce a bit of randomness to the function. Each either will or will not want to buy food, which you can store as the Boolean values or . Then, use the module to have the simulation randomly decide whether or not this particular is going to proceed to the concession stand: This conditional statement will return one of two outcomes:\n• : The will request a server and order food.\n• : The will instead go to find their seats without purchasing any snacks. Now, remember the goal of this simulation is to determine the number of cashiers, ushers, and servers that should be on staff to keep wait times under 10 minutes. To do this, you’ll need to know how long it took any given to make it to their seats. You use at the beginning of the function to track the , and again at the end when each is finished with all processes and heading into the theater: You use to get the time at which the has finished all processes and made it to their seats. You subtract the moviegoer’s from this departure time and append the resulting time difference to your waiting list, . Note: You could store the departure time in a separate variable like , but this would make your code very repetitive, which violates the D.R.Y. principle. This is ready to watch some previews! Now you’ll need to define a function to run the simulation. will be responsible for creating an instance of a theater and generating moviegoers until the simulation stops. The first thing this function should do is create an instance of a theater: Since this is the main process, you’ll need to pass all of the unknowns you’ve declared so far: These are all variables that the simulation needs to create and control the environment, so it’s absolutely vital to pass them all. Then, you define a variable and tell the simulation to set up the theater with a certain number of cashiers, servers, and ushers. You also might want to start your simulation with a few moviegoers waiting at the theater. There will probably be a few people ready to go as soon as the doors open! The manager says to expect around 3 moviegoers in line ready to buy tickets as soon as the box office opens. You can tell the simulation to go ahead and move through this initial group like so: You use to populate the theater with 3 moviegoers. Then, you use to tell the simulation to prepare to move them through the theater. The rest of the moviegoers will make it to the theater in their own time. So, the function should keep sending new customers into the theater as long as the simulation is running. You don’t know how long it will take new moviegoers to make it to the theater, so you decide to look at past data. Using timestamped receipts from the box office, you learn that moviegoers tend to arrive at the theater, on average, every 12 seconds. Now all you have to do is tell the function to wait this long before generating a new person: Note that you use the decimal number to represent 12 seconds. To get this number, you simply divide 12 seconds by 60 seconds, which is the number of seconds in a minute. After waiting, the function should increment by 1 and generate the next person. The generator function is the same one you used to initialize the first 3 moviegoers: That’s it! When you call this function, the simulation will generate 3 moviegoers to start and begin moving them through the theater with . After that, new moviegoers will arrive at the theater with an interval of 12 seconds and move through the theater in their own time. At this point, you should have a list that contains the total amount of time it took each moviegoer to make it to their seat. Now you’ll want to define a function to help calculate the average time a spends from the time they arrive to the time they finish checking their ticket. does just this: This function takes your list as an argument and uses to calculate the average wait time. Since you’re creating a script that will be used by the movie theater manager, you’ll want to make sure that the output can be read easily by the user. You can add a function called to do this: The last part of the function uses to return the results in minutes and seconds, so the manager can easily understand the program’s output. As you’ve built these functions, you’ve run into a few variables that have not been clearly defined: These variables are the parameters that you can change to see how the simulation changes. If a blockbuster movie has customers lining up around the block, how many cashiers should be working? What if people are flying through the box office but getting stuck at concessions? What value of will help ease the flow? Note: That’s the beauty of simulation. It allows you to try these things out so that you can determine the best possible decision in real life. Whoever is using your simulation needs to be able to change the values of these parameters to try out different scenarios. To this end, you’ll create a helper function to get these values from the user: \"Could not parse input. The simulation will use default values:\" This function simply calls Python’s function to retrieve data from the user. Because user input runs the risk of being messy, you can include an clause to catch anything invalid. If the user inputs bad data, then the simulation will run with default values. The last function you’ll want to create is . This will ensure your script runs in the proper order when you execute it on the command line. You can read more about in Defining Main Functions in Python. Here’s what your should look like:\n• Set up your environment by declaring a random seed. This ensures your output will look like what you see in this tutorial.\n• Query the user of your program for some input.\n• Create the environment and save it as the variable , which will move the simulation through each time step.\n• Tell to run the process , which creates the theater environment and generates moviegoers to move through it.\n• Determine how long you want the simulation to run. As a default value, the simulation is set to run for 90 minutes.\n• Store the output of in two variables, and .\n• Use to show the results to the user. With this, the setup is complete!"

This new course will be all about real-world modelling and simulation with SimPy, and I’d love to send you keep you in the loop via email. If you found the guide helpful you would might be interested in the course. That said, you’re completely free to hit “unsubscribe” after the guide arrives if you prefer."
