Imagine an array of values\n\nThen you compute the Prefix Sum:\n\nNote that this can be computed particularly efficient in parallel. In fact, this is one important building block of many parallel algorithms, as described in the thesis \"Vector Models for Data-Parallel Computing\" by Guy E. Blelloch (thesis as PDF File).\n\nAdditionally, it can be computed in two ways: Either starting with the value from , or starting with . This will, of course, affect how the resulting prefix array has to be accessed. Here, I started with , and made the resulting array one element longer than the input array. This may also be implemented differently, but in this case, it makes it easier to obey the array limits (although one would still have to clarify in which cases indices should be considered as inclusive or exclusive).\n\nHowever, given this prefix sum array, one can compute the sum of elements between indices and in constant time, by simply subtracting the corresponding values of the prefix sum array:\n\nthis would mean that the prefix sums would have to be updated. This could be done brute-force, in linear time, by just adding the difference of the old value and the new value to all prefix sums that appear after the modified element (but for this, also see the notes in the last section of this answer)\n\nI could imagine that the maximum value could simply be tracked while building the prefix sums, as well as checking whether the values are only ascending or descending. However, when values are updated, this information would have to be re-computed.\n\nIn any case, there are some data structures that deal with prefix sums in particular. I think that a Fenwick tree might allow to implement some of the O(n) operations mentioned above in O(logn), but I have not yet looked at this in detail."

        "document": "The Python interpreter has a number of functions and types built into it that are always available. They are listed here in alphabetical order.\n\nOpen file and return a corresponding file object. If the file cannot be opened, an is raised. See Reading and Writing Files for more examples of how to use this function. file is a path-like object giving the pathname (absolute or relative to the current working directory) of the file to be opened or an integer file descriptor of the file to be wrapped. (If a file descriptor is given, it is closed when the returned I/O object is closed unless closefd is set to .) mode is an optional string that specifies the mode in which the file is opened. It defaults to which means open for reading in text mode. Other common values are for writing (truncating the file if it already exists), for exclusive creation, and for appending (which on some Unix systems, means that all writes append to the end of the file regardless of the current seek position). In text mode, if encoding is not specified the encoding used is platform-dependent: is called to get the current locale encoding. (For reading and writing raw bytes use binary mode and leave encoding unspecified.) The available modes are: open for writing, truncating the file first open for exclusive creation, failing if the file already exists open for writing, appending to the end of file if it exists The default mode is (open for reading text, a synonym of ). Modes and open and truncate the file. Modes and open the file with no truncation. As mentioned in the Overview, Python distinguishes between binary and text I/O. Files opened in binary mode (including in the mode argument) return contents as objects without any decoding. In text mode (the default, or when is included in the mode argument), the contents of the file are returned as , the bytes having been first decoded using a platform-dependent encoding or using the specified encoding if given. Python doesn’t depend on the underlying operating system’s notion of text files; all the processing is done by Python itself, and is therefore platform-independent. buffering is an optional integer used to set the buffering policy. Pass 0 to switch buffering off (only allowed in binary mode), 1 to select line buffering (only usable when writing in text mode), and an integer > 1 to indicate the size in bytes of a fixed-size chunk buffer. Note that specifying a buffer size this way applies for binary buffered I/O, but (i.e., files opened with ) would have another buffering. To disable buffering in , consider using the flag for . When no buffering argument is given, the default buffering policy works as follows:\n• None Binary files are buffered in fixed-size chunks; the size of the buffer is chosen using a heuristic trying to determine the underlying device’s “block size” and falling back on . On many systems, the buffer will typically be 4096 or 8192 bytes long.\n• None “Interactive” text files (files for which returns ) use line buffering. Other text files use the policy described above for binary files. encoding is the name of the encoding used to decode or encode the file. This should only be used in text mode. The default encoding is platform dependent (whatever returns), but any text encoding supported by Python can be used. See the module for the list of supported encodings. errors is an optional string that specifies how encoding and decoding errors are to be handled—this cannot be used in binary mode. A variety of standard error handlers are available (listed under Error Handlers), though any error handling name that has been registered with is also valid. The standard names include:\n• None to raise a exception if there is an encoding error. The default value of has the same effect.\n• None ignores errors. Note that ignoring encoding errors can lead to data loss.\n• None causes a replacement marker (such as ) to be inserted where there is malformed data.\n• None will represent any incorrect bytes as low surrogate code units ranging from U+DC80 to U+DCFF. These surrogate code units will then be turned back into the same bytes when the error handler is used when writing data. This is useful for processing files in an unknown encoding.\n• None is only supported when writing to a file. Characters not supported by the encoding are replaced with the appropriate XML character reference .\n• None (also only supported when writing) replaces unsupported characters with escape sequences. newline determines how to parse newline characters from the stream. It can be , , , , and . It works as follows:\n• None When reading input from the stream, if newline is , universal newlines mode is enabled. Lines in the input can end in , , or , and these are translated into before being returned to the caller. If it is , universal newlines mode is enabled, but line endings are returned to the caller untranslated. If it has any of the other legal values, input lines are only terminated by the given string, and the line ending is returned to the caller untranslated.\n• None When writing output to the stream, if newline is , any characters written are translated to the system default line separator, . If newline is or , no translation takes place. If newline is any of the other legal values, any characters written are translated to the given string. If closefd is and a file descriptor rather than a filename was given, the underlying file descriptor will be kept open when the file is closed. If a filename is given closefd must be (the default); otherwise, an error will be raised. A custom opener can be used by passing a callable as opener. The underlying file descriptor for the file object is then obtained by calling opener with (file, flags). opener must return an open file descriptor (passing as opener results in functionality similar to passing ). The following example uses the dir_fd parameter of the function to open a file relative to a given directory: 'This will be written to somedir/spamspam.txt' The type of file object returned by the function depends on the mode. When is used to open a file in a text mode ( , , , , etc.), it returns a subclass of (specifically ). When used to open a file in a binary mode with buffering, the returned class is a subclass of . The exact class varies: in read binary mode, it returns an ; in write binary and append binary modes, it returns an , and in read/write mode, it returns an . When buffering is disabled, the raw stream, a subclass of , , is returned. See also the file handling modules, such as , (where is declared), , , , and . The and arguments may have been modified or inferred from the original call.\n• None used to be raised, it is now an alias of .\n• None is now raised if the file opened in exclusive creation mode ( ) already exists.\n• None The file is now non-inheritable.\n• None If the system call is interrupted and the signal handler does not raise an exception, the function now retries the system call instead of raising an exception (see PEP 475 for the rationale).\n• None On Windows, opening a console buffer may return a subclass of other than . Changed in version 3.11: The mode has been removed.\n\nReturn a proxy object that delegates method calls to a parent or sibling class of type. This is useful for accessing inherited methods that have been overridden in a class. The object_or_type determines the method resolution order to be searched. The search starts from the class right after the type. For example, if of object_or_type is and the value of type is , then searches . The attribute of the class corresponding to object_or_type lists the method resolution search order used by both and . The attribute is dynamic and can change whenever the inheritance hierarchy is updated. If the second argument is omitted, the super object returned is unbound. If the second argument is an object, must be true. If the second argument is a type, must be true (this is useful for classmethods). When called directly within an ordinary method of a class, both arguments may be omitted (“zero-argument ”). In this case, type will be the enclosing class, and obj will be the first argument of the immediately enclosing function (typically ). (This means that zero-argument will not work as expected within nested functions, including generator expressions, which implicitly create nested functions.) There are two typical use cases for super. In a class hierarchy with single inheritance, super can be used to refer to parent classes without naming them explicitly, thus making the code more maintainable. This use closely parallels the use of super in other programming languages. The second use case is to support cooperative multiple inheritance in a dynamic execution environment. This use case is unique to Python and is not found in statically compiled languages or languages that only support single inheritance. This makes it possible to implement “diamond diagrams” where multiple base classes implement the same method. Good design dictates that such implementations have the same calling signature in every case (because the order of calls is determined at runtime, because that order adapts to changes in the class hierarchy, and because that order can include sibling classes that are unknown prior to runtime). For both use cases, a typical superclass call looks like this: # This does the same thing as: In addition to method lookups, also works for attribute lookups. One possible use case for this is calling descriptors in a parent or sibling class. Note that is implemented as part of the binding process for explicit dotted attribute lookups such as . It does so by implementing its own method for searching classes in a predictable order that supports cooperative multiple inheritance. Accordingly, is undefined for implicit lookups using statements or operators such as . Also note that, aside from the zero argument form, is not limited to use inside methods. The two argument form specifies the arguments exactly and makes the appropriate references. The zero argument form only works inside a class definition, as the compiler fills in the necessary details to correctly retrieve the class being defined, as well as accessing the current instance for ordinary methods. For practical suggestions on how to design cooperative classes using , see guide to using super()."
