Use additional flex utilities as needed to adjust this behavior.\n\nInput groups work, too. If your navbar is an entire form, or mostly a form, you can use the element as the container and save some HTML.\n\nVarious buttons are supported as part of these navbar forms, too.

Or you can add a container inside the to only center the contents of a fixed or static top navbar.\n\nUse any of the responsive containers to change how wide the content in your navbar is presented.\n\nUse our position utilities to place navbars in non-static positions. Choose from fixed to the top, fixed to the bottom, or stickied to the top (scrolls with the page until it reaches the top, then stays there). Fixed navbars use , meaning they’re pulled from the normal flow of the DOM and may require custom CSS (e.g., on the ) to prevent overlap with other elements.\n\nAlso note that uses , which isn’t fully supported in every browser.\n\nAdd to a (or other navbar sub-component) to enable vertical scrolling within the toggleable contents of a collapsed navbar. By default, scrolling kicks in at (or 75% of the viewport height), but you can override that with the local CSS custom property or custom styles.

We also recommend making sure that the toggler has the attribute, pointing to the of the content container. In theory, this allows assistive technology users to jump directly from the toggler to the container it controls–but support for this is currently quite patchy.\n\nTransform your expanding and collapsing navbar into an offcanvas drawer with the offcanvas plugin.
