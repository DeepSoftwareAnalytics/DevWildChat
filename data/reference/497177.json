        "document": "This module defines base classes for standard Python codecs (encoders and decoders) and provides access to the internal Python codec registry, which manages the codec and error handling lookup process. Most standard codecs are text encodings, which encode text to bytes (and decode bytes to text), but there are also codecs provided that encode text to text, and bytes to bytes. Custom codecs may encode and decode between arbitrary types, but some module features are restricted to be used specifically with text encodings or with codecs that encode to .\n\nThe module defines the following functions for encoding and decoding with any codec:\n\nThe full details for each codec can also be looked up directly:\n\nTo simplify access to the various codec components, the module provides these additional functions which use for the codec lookup:\n\nCustom codecs are made available by registering a suitable codec search function:\n\nWhile the builtin and the associated module are the recommended approach for working with encoded text files, this module provides additional utility functions and classes that allow the use of a wider range of codecs when working with binary files:\n\nThe module also provides the following constants which are useful for reading and writing to platform dependent files:\n\nThe module defines a set of base classes which define the interfaces for working with codec objects, and can also be used as the basis for custom codec implementations. Each codec has to define four interfaces to make it usable as codec in Python: stateless encoder, stateless decoder, stream reader and stream writer. The stream reader and writers typically reuse the stateless encoder/decoder to implement the file protocols. Codec authors also need to define how the codec will handle encoding and decoding errors. To simplify and standardize error handling, codecs may implement different error handling schemes by accepting the errors string argument: The following error handlers can be used with all Python Standard Encodings codecs: Raise (or a subclass), this is the default. Implemented in . Ignore the malformed data and continue without further notice. Implemented in . Replace with a replacement marker. On encoding, use (ASCII character). On decoding, use (U+FFFD, the official REPLACEMENT CHARACTER). Implemented in . Replace with backslashed escape sequences. On encoding, use hexadecimal form of Unicode code point with formats . On decoding, use hexadecimal form of byte value with format . Implemented in . On decoding, replace byte with individual surrogate code ranging from to . This code will then be turned back into the same byte when the error handler is used when encoding the data. (See PEP 383 for more.) The following error handlers are only applicable to encoding (within text encodings): Replace with XML/HTML numeric character reference, which is a decimal form of Unicode code point with format . Implemented in . Replace with escape sequences, what appears in the braces is the Name property from Unicode Character Database. Implemented in . In addition, the following error handler is specific to the given codecs: Allow encoding and decoding surrogate code point ( - ) as normal code point. Otherwise these codecs treat the presence of surrogate code point in as an error. Added in version 3.1: The and error handlers. Changed in version 3.4: The error handler now works with utf-16* and utf-32* codecs. Changed in version 3.5: The error handler now works with decoding and translating. The set of allowed values can be extended by registering a new named error handler: Register the error handling function error_handler under the name name. The error_handler argument will be called during encoding and decoding in case of an error, when name is specified as the errors parameter. For encoding, error_handler will be called with a instance, which contains information about the location of the error. The error handler must either raise this or a different exception, or return a tuple with a replacement for the unencodable part of the input and a position where encoding should continue. The replacement may be either or . If the replacement is bytes, the encoder will simply copy them into the output buffer. If the replacement is a string, the encoder will encode the replacement. Encoding continues on original input at the specified position. Negative position values will be treated as being relative to the end of the input string. If the resulting position is out of bound an will be raised. Decoding and translating works similarly, except or will be passed to the handler and that the replacement from the error handler will be put into the output directly. Previously registered error handlers (including the standard error handlers) can be looked up by name: Return the error handler previously registered under the name name. Raises a in case the handler cannot be found. The following standard error handlers are also made available as module level functions: Malformed data is ignored; encoding or decoding is continued without further notice. Substitutes (ASCII character) for encoding errors or (U+FFFD, the official REPLACEMENT CHARACTER) for decoding errors. Malformed data is replaced by a backslashed escape sequence. On encoding, use the hexadecimal form of Unicode code point with formats . On decoding, use the hexadecimal form of byte value with format . Changed in version 3.5: Works with decoding and translating. Implements the error handling (for encoding within text encoding only). The unencodable character is replaced by an appropriate XML/HTML numeric character reference, which is a decimal form of Unicode code point with format . Implements the error handling (for encoding within text encoding only). The unencodable character is replaced by a escape sequence. The set of characters that appear in the braces is the Name property from Unicode Character Database. For example, the German lowercase letter will be converted to byte sequence . The base class defines these methods which also define the function interfaces of the stateless encoder and decoder: Encodes the object input and returns a tuple (output object, length consumed). For instance, text encoding converts a string object to a bytes object using a particular character set encoding (e.g., or ). The errors argument defines the error handling to apply. It defaults to handling. The method may not store state in the instance. Use for codecs which have to keep state in order to make encoding efficient. The encoder must be able to handle zero length input and return an empty object of the output object type in this situation. Decodes the object input and returns a tuple (output object, length consumed). For instance, for a text encoding, decoding converts a bytes object encoded using a particular character set encoding to a string object. For text encodings and bytes-to-bytes codecs, input must be a bytes object or one which provides the read-only buffer interface – for example, buffer objects and memory mapped files. The errors argument defines the error handling to apply. It defaults to handling. The method may not store state in the instance. Use for codecs which have to keep state in order to make decoding efficient. The decoder must be able to handle zero length input and return an empty object of the output object type in this situation. The and classes provide the basic interface for incremental encoding and decoding. Encoding/decoding the input isn’t done with one call to the stateless encoder/decoder function, but with multiple calls to the / method of the incremental encoder/decoder. The incremental encoder/decoder keeps track of the encoding/decoding process during method calls. The joined output of calls to the / method is the same as if all the single inputs were joined into one, and this input was encoded/decoded with the stateless encoder/decoder. The class is used for encoding an input in multiple steps. It defines the following methods which every incremental encoder must define in order to be compatible with the Python codec registry. All incremental encoders must provide this constructor interface. They are free to add additional keyword arguments, but only the ones defined here are used by the Python codec registry. The may implement different error handling schemes by providing the errors keyword argument. See Error Handlers for possible values. The errors argument will be assigned to an attribute of the same name. Assigning to this attribute makes it possible to switch between different error handling strategies during the lifetime of the object. Encodes object (taking the current state of the encoder into account) and returns the resulting encoded object. If this is the last call to final must be true (the default is false). Reset the encoder to the initial state. The output is discarded: call , passing an empty byte or text string if necessary, to reset the encoder and to get the output. Return the current state of the encoder which must be an integer. The implementation should make sure that is the most common state. (States that are more complicated than integers can be converted into an integer by marshaling/pickling the state and encoding the bytes of the resulting string into an integer.) Set the state of the encoder to state. state must be an encoder state returned by . The class is used for decoding an input in multiple steps. It defines the following methods which every incremental decoder must define in order to be compatible with the Python codec registry. All incremental decoders must provide this constructor interface. They are free to add additional keyword arguments, but only the ones defined here are used by the Python codec registry. The may implement different error handling schemes by providing the errors keyword argument. See Error Handlers for possible values. The errors argument will be assigned to an attribute of the same name. Assigning to this attribute makes it possible to switch between different error handling strategies during the lifetime of the object. Decodes object (taking the current state of the decoder into account) and returns the resulting decoded object. If this is the last call to final must be true (the default is false). If final is true the decoder must decode the input completely and must flush all buffers. If this isn’t possible (e.g. because of incomplete byte sequences at the end of the input) it must initiate error handling just like in the stateless case (which might raise an exception). Reset the decoder to the initial state. Return the current state of the decoder. This must be a tuple with two items, the first must be the buffer containing the still undecoded input. The second must be an integer and can be additional state info. (The implementation should make sure that is the most common additional state info.) If this additional state info is it must be possible to set the decoder to the state which has no input buffered and as the additional state info, so that feeding the previously buffered input to the decoder returns it to the previous state without producing any output. (Additional state info that is more complicated than integers can be converted into an integer by marshaling/pickling the info and encoding the bytes of the resulting string into an integer.) Set the state of the decoder to state. state must be a decoder state returned by . The and classes provide generic working interfaces which can be used to implement new encoding submodules very easily. See for an example of how this is done. The class is a subclass of and defines the following methods which every stream writer must define in order to be compatible with the Python codec registry. All stream writers must provide this constructor interface. They are free to add additional keyword arguments, but only the ones defined here are used by the Python codec registry. The stream argument must be a file-like object open for writing text or binary data, as appropriate for the specific codec. The may implement different error handling schemes by providing the errors keyword argument. See Error Handlers for the standard error handlers the underlying stream codec may support. The errors argument will be assigned to an attribute of the same name. Assigning to this attribute makes it possible to switch between different error handling strategies during the lifetime of the object. Writes the object’s contents encoded to the stream. Writes the concatenated iterable of strings to the stream (possibly by reusing the method). Infinite or very large iterables are not supported. The standard bytes-to-bytes codecs do not support this method. Resets the codec buffers used for keeping internal state. Calling this method should ensure that the data on the output is put into a clean state that allows appending of new fresh data without having to rescan the whole stream to recover state. In addition to the above methods, the must also inherit all other methods and attributes from the underlying stream. The class is a subclass of and defines the following methods which every stream reader must define in order to be compatible with the Python codec registry. All stream readers must provide this constructor interface. They are free to add additional keyword arguments, but only the ones defined here are used by the Python codec registry. The stream argument must be a file-like object open for reading text or binary data, as appropriate for the specific codec. The may implement different error handling schemes by providing the errors keyword argument. See Error Handlers for the standard error handlers the underlying stream codec may support. The errors argument will be assigned to an attribute of the same name. Assigning to this attribute makes it possible to switch between different error handling strategies during the lifetime of the object. The set of allowed values for the errors argument can be extended with . Decodes data from the stream and returns the resulting object. The chars argument indicates the number of decoded code points or bytes to return. The method will never return more data than requested, but it might return less, if there is not enough available. The size argument indicates the approximate maximum number of encoded bytes or code points to read for decoding. The decoder can modify this setting as appropriate. The default value -1 indicates to read and decode as much as possible. This parameter is intended to prevent having to decode huge files in one step. The firstline flag indicates that it would be sufficient to only return the first line, if there are decoding errors on later lines. The method should use a greedy read strategy meaning that it should read as much data as is allowed within the definition of the encoding and the given size, e.g. if optional encoding endings or state markers are available on the stream, these should be read too. Read one line from the input stream and return the decoded data. size, if given, is passed as size argument to the stream’s method. If keepends is false line-endings will be stripped from the lines returned. Read all lines available on the input stream and return them as a list of lines. Line-endings are implemented using the codec’s method and are included in the list entries if keepends is true. sizehint, if given, is passed as the size argument to the stream’s method. Resets the codec buffers used for keeping internal state. Note that no stream repositioning should take place. This method is primarily intended to be able to recover from decoding errors. In addition to the above methods, the must also inherit all other methods and attributes from the underlying stream. The is a convenience class that allows wrapping streams which work in both read and write modes. The design is such that one can use the factory functions returned by the function to construct the instance. Creates a instance. stream must be a file-like object. Reader and Writer must be factory functions or classes providing the and interface resp. Error handling is done in the same way as defined for the stream readers and writers. instances define the combined interfaces of and classes. They inherit all other methods and attributes from the underlying stream. The translates data from one encoding to another, which is sometimes useful when dealing with different encoding environments. The design is such that one can use the factory functions returned by the function to construct the instance. Creates a instance which implements a two-way conversion: encode and decode work on the frontend — the data visible to code calling and , while Reader and Writer work on the backend — the data in stream. You can use these objects to do transparent transcodings, e.g., from Latin-1 to UTF-8 and back. The stream argument must be a file-like object. The encode and decode arguments must adhere to the interface. Reader and Writer must be factory functions or classes providing objects of the and interface respectively. Error handling is done in the same way as defined for the stream readers and writers. instances define the combined interfaces of and classes. They inherit all other methods and attributes from the underlying stream.\n\nStrings are stored internally as sequences of code points in range – . (See PEP 393 for more details about the implementation.) Once a string object is used outside of CPU and memory, endianness and how these arrays are stored as bytes become an issue. As with other codecs, serialising a string into a sequence of bytes is known as encoding, and recreating the string from the sequence of bytes is known as decoding. There are a variety of different text serialisation codecs, which are collectivity referred to as text encodings. The simplest text encoding (called or ) maps the code points 0–255 to the bytes – , which means that a string object that contains code points above can’t be encoded with this codec. Doing so will raise a that looks like the following (although the details of the error message may differ): UnicodeEncodeError: 'latin-1' codec can't encode character '\\u1234' in position 3: ordinal not in range(256) . There’s another group of encodings (the so called charmap encodings) that choose a different subset of all Unicode code points and how these code points are mapped to the bytes – . To see how this is done simply open e.g. (which is an encoding that is used primarily on Windows). There’s a string constant with 256 characters that shows you which character is mapped to which byte value. All of these encodings can only encode 256 of the 1114112 code points defined in Unicode. A simple and straightforward way that can store each Unicode code point, is to store each code point as four consecutive bytes. There are two possibilities: store the bytes in big endian or in little endian order. These two encodings are called and respectively. Their disadvantage is that if e.g. you use on a little endian machine you will always have to swap bytes on encoding and decoding. avoids this problem: bytes will always be in natural endianness. When these bytes are read by a CPU with a different endianness, then bytes have to be swapped though. To be able to detect the endianness of a or byte sequence, there’s the so called BOM (“Byte Order Mark”). This is the Unicode character . This character can be prepended to every or byte sequence. The byte swapped version of this character ( ) is an illegal character that may not appear in a Unicode text. So when the first character in a or byte sequence appears to be a the bytes have to be swapped on decoding. Unfortunately the character had a second purpose as a : a character that has no width and doesn’t allow a word to be split. It can e.g. be used to give hints to a ligature algorithm. With Unicode 4.0 using as a has been deprecated (with ( ) assuming this role). Nevertheless Unicode software still must be able to handle in both roles: as a BOM it’s a device to determine the storage layout of the encoded bytes, and vanishes once the byte sequence has been decoded into a string; as a it’s a normal character that will be decoded like any other. There’s another encoding that is able to encode the full range of Unicode characters: UTF-8. UTF-8 is an 8-bit encoding, which means there are no issues with byte order in UTF-8. Each byte in a UTF-8 byte sequence consists of two parts: marker bits (the most significant bits) and payload bits. The marker bits are a sequence of zero to four bits followed by a bit. Unicode characters are encoded like this (with x being payload bits, which when concatenated give the Unicode character): The least significant bit of the Unicode character is the rightmost x bit. As UTF-8 is an 8-bit encoding no BOM is required and any character in the decoded string (even if it’s the first character) is treated as a . Without external information it’s impossible to reliably determine which encoding was used for encoding a string. Each charmap encoding can decode any random byte sequence. However that’s not possible with UTF-8, as UTF-8 byte sequences have a structure that doesn’t allow arbitrary byte sequences. To increase the reliability with which a UTF-8 encoding can be detected, Microsoft invented a variant of UTF-8 (that Python calls ) for its Notepad program: Before any of the Unicode characters is written to the file, a UTF-8 encoded BOM (which looks like this as a byte sequence: , , ) is written. As it’s rather improbable that any charmap encoded file starts with these byte values (which would e.g. map to in iso-8859-1), this increases the probability that a encoding can be correctly guessed from the byte sequence. So here the BOM is not used to be able to determine the byte order used for generating the byte sequence, but as a signature that helps in guessing the encoding. On encoding the utf-8-sig codec will write , , as the first three bytes to the file. On decoding will skip those three bytes if they appear as the first three bytes in the file. In UTF-8, the use of the BOM is discouraged and should generally be avoided.\n\nA number of predefined codecs are specific to Python, so their codec names have no meaning outside Python. These are listed in the tables below based on the expected input and output types (note that while text encodings are the most common use case for codecs, the underlying codec infrastructure supports arbitrary data transforms rather than just text encodings). For asymmetric codecs, the stated meaning describes the encoding direction. The following codecs provide to encoding and bytes-like object to decoding, similar to the Unicode text encodings. Implement RFC 3490, see also . Only is supported. Windows only: Encode the operand according to the ANSI codepage (CP_ACP). Windows only: Encode the operand according to the OEM codepage (CP_OEMCP). Latin-1 encoding with and for other code points. Existing backslashes are not escaped in any way. It is used in the Python pickle protocol. Raise an exception for all conversions, even empty strings. The error handler is ignored. Encoding suitable as the contents of a Unicode literal in ASCII-encoded Python source code, except that quotes are not escaped. Decode from Latin-1 source code. Beware that Python source code actually uses UTF-8 by default. The following codecs provide binary transforms: bytes-like object to mappings. They are not supported by (which only produces output). Convert the operand to multiline MIME base64 (the result always includes a trailing ). Changed in version 3.4: accepts any bytes-like object as input for encoding and decoding Convert the operand to hexadecimal representation, with two digits per byte. Added in version 3.2: Restoration of the binary transforms. Changed in version 3.4: Restoration of the aliases for the binary transforms. The following codec provides a text transform: a to mapping. It is not supported by (which only produces output). Return the Caesar-cypher encryption of the operand. Added in version 3.2: Restoration of the text transform. Changed in version 3.4: Restoration of the alias.\n\nThis module implements RFC 3490 (Internationalized Domain Names in Applications) and RFC 3492 (Nameprep: A Stringprep Profile for Internationalized Domain Names (IDN)). It builds upon the encoding and . If you need the IDNA 2008 standard from RFC 5891 and RFC 5895, use the third-party idna module. These RFCs together define a protocol to support non-ASCII characters in domain names. A domain name containing non-ASCII characters (such as ) is converted into an ASCII-compatible encoding (ACE, such as ). The ACE form of the domain name is then used in all places where arbitrary characters are not allowed by the protocol, such as DNS queries, HTTP Host fields, and so on. This conversion is carried out in the application; if possible invisible to the user: The application should transparently convert Unicode domain labels to IDNA on the wire, and convert back ACE labels to Unicode before presenting them to the user. Python supports this conversion in several ways: the codec performs conversion between Unicode and ACE, separating an input string into labels based on the separator characters defined in section 3.1 of RFC 3490 and converting each label to ACE as required, and conversely separating an input byte string into labels based on the separator and converting any ACE labels found into unicode. Furthermore, the module transparently converts Unicode host names to ACE, so that applications need not be concerned about converting host names themselves when they pass them to the socket module. On top of that, modules that have host names as function parameters, such as and , accept Unicode host names ( then also transparently sends an IDNA hostname in the Host field if it sends that field at all). When receiving host names from the wire (such as in reverse name lookup), no automatic conversion to Unicode is performed: applications wishing to present such host names to the user should decode them to Unicode. The module also implements the nameprep procedure, which performs certain normalizations on host names, to achieve case-insensitivity of international domain names, and to unify similar characters. The nameprep functions can be used directly if desired. Return the nameprepped version of label. The implementation currently assumes query strings, so is true. Convert a label to ASCII, as specified in RFC 3490. is assumed to be false. Convert a label to Unicode, as specified in RFC 3490."

        "document": "Several errors can arise when an attempt to decode a byte string from a certain coding scheme is made. The reason is the inability of some encoding schemes to represent all code points. One of the most common errors during these conversions is UnicodeDecode Error which occurs when decoding a byte string by an incorrect coding scheme. This article will teach you how to resolve a UnicodeDecodeError for a CSV file in Python.\n\nWhy does the UnicodeDecodeError error arise?\n\nThe error occurs when an attempt to represent code points outside the range of the coding is made. To solve the issue, the byte string should be decoded using the same coding scheme in which it was encoded. i.e., The encoding scheme should be the same when the string is encoded and decoded.\n\nFor demonstration, the same error would be reproduced and then fixed. In the below code, firstly the character a (byte string) is decoded using ASCII encoding successfully. Then an attempt to decode the byte string a\\xf1 is made, which led to an error. This is because the ASCII encoding standard only allows representation of the characters within the range 0 to 127. Any attempt to address a character outside this range would lead to the ordinal not-in-range error.\n\nTo rectify the error, an encoding scheme would be used that would be sufficient to represent the \\xf1 code point. In this case, the unicode_escape coding scheme would be used:\n\nHow to Resolve a UnicodeDecodeError for a CSV file\n\nIt is common to encounter the error mentioned above when processing a CSV file. This is because the CSV file may have a different encoding than the one used by the Python program. To fix such an error, the encoding used in the CSV file would be specified while opening the file. If the encoding standard of the CSV file is known, the Python interpreter could be instructed to use a specific encoding standard while that CSV file is being opened. This method is only usable if the encoding of the CSV is known.\n\nTo demonstrate the occurrence of the error, the following CSV file will be used:\n\nThe following code attempts to open the CSV file for processing. The above code, upon execution, led to the following error:\n\nThe error occurred as the read_csv method could not decode the contents of the CSV file by using the default encoding, UTF-8. This is because the encoding of the file is UTF-16. Hence the encoding of the CSV file needs to be mentioned while opening the CSV file to fix the error and allow the processing of the CSV file.\n\nFirstly, the pandas‘ library is imported, and the path to the CSV file is specified. Then the program calls the read_csv function to read the contents of the CSV file specified by the path and also passes the encoding through which the CSV file must be decoded (UTF-16 in this case). Since the decoding scheme mentioned in the argument is the one with which the CSV file was originally encoded, the file gets decoded successfully.\n\nAnother way of resolving the issue is by changing the encoding of the CSV file itself. For that, firstly, open the CSV file as a text file (using notepad or Wordpad):\n\nNow go to file and select Save as:\n\nA prompt would appear, and from there, select the encoding option and change it to UTF-8 (the default for Python and pandas), and select Save.\n\nNow the following code would run without errors\n\nThe code ran without errors. This is because the default encoding of the CSV file was changed to UTF-8 before opening it with pandas. Since the default encoding used by pandas is UTF-8, the CSV file opened without error."

The problem is called \"regex search,\" and the instructions are as follows:\n\nMy current attempt to read the files is by using the glob() method to return all .txt files, then loop through the results of the glob() method. When attempting to call the read() method on the path object, I receive the following error:\n\nHaving already searched around for this specific error message, I've found some results that suggest that the file cannot be read in its current format.

I can skip the glob() method and instead loop through os.listdir() to retrieve the .txt files, but I would still like to reach out on guidance regarding the UnicodeDecodeError because I want to better understand not only why the error was thrown but also how to fix it.\n\nHere is my code:"

        "document": "When working with data in Python, the Pandas library is a powerful tool that simplifies the process of data manipulation and analysis. One of the many things it’s great at is importing data from various formats, including CSV files. However, it’s not always a smooth process. You might sometimes run into an error such as .\n\nIf you’ve seen this error, you know it can be frustrating. It usually happens when the CSV file you’re trying to read isn’t in the UTF-8 encoding, but you’re trying to read it as if it was. In this post, we’ll discuss several ways to tackle this issue.\n\nThe first approach is to try and read the file with a different encoding. Python supports a myriad of encodings, which can be passed to the function using the parameter. For example, if your file is in \"ISO-8859-1\" (also known as \"latin1\") encoding, you could read it like this:\n\nIf you’re unsure about the file’s encoding and the previous step doesn’t solve the problem, another option is to employ the library to guess the encoding. Here's how to do it:\n\nThis approach is more versatile as will make a good guess on the encoding type, enabling you to read the file correctly.\n\nAnother strategy is to ignore the errors and replace problematic characters with a replacement character. However, this approach could lead to data loss. Therefore, it’s generally only a good idea if there are only a few problematic characters and they are not significant to your data analysis. Here’s how to do it:\n\nSome encodings are more flexible than others. For example, “utf-8-sig” is a variant of UTF-8 that is more tolerant of certain types of errors:\n\nThis could be a handy trick when dealing with files that have minor issues with their encoding.\n\nWhile encountering a when reading a CSV file with Pandas can be quite annoying, several strategies can help you overcome this hurdle. Depending on your specific case, you might need to try different approaches until you find the one that works for you. Whether it's trying a different encoding, guessing the encoding, ignoring errors, or using a more flexible encoding, these methods will help you successfully read your CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.\n\nRemember, data manipulation is often the most time-consuming part of data analysis, but it’s also one of the most crucial. Knowing how to handle such errors will make your data analysis process more efficient and enjoyable."
