        "document": "Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying its state.\n\nCompared with other programming languages, Python’s class mechanism adds classes with a minimum of new syntax and semantics. It is a mixture of the class mechanisms found in C++ and Modula-3. Python classes provide all the standard features of Object Oriented Programming: the class inheritance mechanism allows multiple base classes, a derived class can override any methods of its base class or classes, and a method can call the method of a base class with the same name. Objects can contain arbitrary amounts and kinds of data. As is true for modules, classes partake of the dynamic nature of Python: they are created at runtime, and can be modified further after creation.\n\nIn C++ terminology, normally class members (including the data members) are public (except see below Private Variables), and all member functions are virtual. As in Modula-3, there are no shorthands for referencing the object’s members from its methods: the method function is declared with an explicit first argument representing the object, which is provided implicitly by the call. As in Smalltalk, classes themselves are objects. This provides semantics for importing and renaming. Unlike C++ and Modula-3, built-in types can be used as base classes for extension by the user. Also, like in C++, most built-in operators with special syntax (arithmetic operators, subscripting etc.) can be redefined for class instances.\n\nBefore introducing classes, I first have to tell you something about Python’s scope rules. Class definitions play some neat tricks with namespaces, and you need to know how scopes and namespaces work to fully understand what’s going on. Incidentally, knowledge about this subject is useful for any advanced Python programmer. A namespace is a mapping from names to objects. Most namespaces are currently implemented as Python dictionaries, but that’s normally not noticeable in any way (except for performance), and it may change in the future. Examples of namespaces are: the set of built-in names (containing functions such as , and built-in exception names); the global names in a module; and the local names in a function invocation. In a sense the set of attributes of an object also form a namespace. The important thing to know about namespaces is that there is absolutely no relation between names in different namespaces; for instance, two different modules may both define a function without confusion — users of the modules must prefix it with the module name. By the way, I use the word attribute for any name following a dot — for example, in the expression , is an attribute of the object . Strictly speaking, references to names in modules are attribute references: in the expression , is a module object and is an attribute of it. In this case there happens to be a straightforward mapping between the module’s attributes and the global names defined in the module: they share the same namespace! Attributes may be read-only or writable. In the latter case, assignment to attributes is possible. Module attributes are writable: you can write . Writable attributes may also be deleted with the statement. For example, will remove the attribute from the object named by . Namespaces are created at different moments and have different lifetimes. The namespace containing the built-in names is created when the Python interpreter starts up, and is never deleted. The global namespace for a module is created when the module definition is read in; normally, module namespaces also last until the interpreter quits. The statements executed by the top-level invocation of the interpreter, either read from a script file or interactively, are considered part of a module called , so they have their own global namespace. (The built-in names actually also live in a module; this is called .) The local namespace for a function is created when the function is called, and deleted when the function returns or raises an exception that is not handled within the function. (Actually, forgetting would be a better way to describe what actually happens.) Of course, recursive invocations each have their own local namespace. A scope is a textual region of a Python program where a namespace is directly accessible. “Directly accessible” here means that an unqualified reference to a name attempts to find the name in the namespace. Although scopes are determined statically, they are used dynamically. At any time during execution, there are 3 or 4 nested scopes whose namespaces are directly accessible:\n• None the innermost scope, which is searched first, contains the local names\n• None the scopes of any enclosing functions, which are searched starting with the nearest enclosing scope, contain non-local, but also non-global names\n• None the next-to-last scope contains the current module’s global names\n• None the outermost scope (searched last) is the namespace containing built-in names If a name is declared global, then all references and assignments go directly to the next-to-last scope containing the module’s global names. To rebind variables found outside of the innermost scope, the statement can be used; if not declared nonlocal, those variables are read-only (an attempt to write to such a variable will simply create a new local variable in the innermost scope, leaving the identically named outer variable unchanged). Usually, the local scope references the local names of the (textually) current function. Outside functions, the local scope references the same namespace as the global scope: the module’s namespace. Class definitions place yet another namespace in the local scope. It is important to realize that scopes are determined textually: the global scope of a function defined in a module is that module’s namespace, no matter from where or by what alias the function is called. On the other hand, the actual search for names is done dynamically, at run time — however, the language definition is evolving towards static name resolution, at “compile” time, so don’t rely on dynamic name resolution! (In fact, local variables are already determined statically.) A special quirk of Python is that – if no or statement is in effect – assignments to names always go into the innermost scope. Assignments do not copy data — they just bind names to objects. The same is true for deletions: the statement removes the binding of from the namespace referenced by the local scope. In fact, all operations that introduce new names use the local scope: in particular, statements and function definitions bind the module or function name in the local scope. The statement can be used to indicate that particular variables live in the global scope and should be rebound there; the statement indicates that particular variables live in an enclosing scope and should be rebound there. This is an example demonstrating how to reference the different scopes and namespaces, and how and affect variable binding: The output of the example code is: After local assignment: test spam After nonlocal assignment: nonlocal spam After global assignment: nonlocal spam In global scope: global spam Note how the local assignment (which is default) didn’t change scope_test's binding of spam. The assignment changed scope_test's binding of spam, and the assignment changed the module-level binding. You can also see that there was no previous binding for spam before the assignment.\n\nA First Look at Classes¶ Classes introduce a little bit of new syntax, three new object types, and some new semantics. The simplest form of class definition looks like this: Class definitions, like function definitions ( statements) must be executed before they have any effect. (You could conceivably place a class definition in a branch of an statement, or inside a function.) In practice, the statements inside a class definition will usually be function definitions, but other statements are allowed, and sometimes useful — we’ll come back to this later. The function definitions inside a class normally have a peculiar form of argument list, dictated by the calling conventions for methods — again, this is explained later. When a class definition is entered, a new namespace is created, and used as the local scope — thus, all assignments to local variables go into this new namespace. In particular, function definitions bind the name of the new function here. When a class definition is left normally (via the end), a class object is created. This is basically a wrapper around the contents of the namespace created by the class definition; we’ll learn more about class objects in the next section. The original local scope (the one in effect just before the class definition was entered) is reinstated, and the class object is bound here to the class name given in the class definition header ( in the example). Class objects support two kinds of operations: attribute references and instantiation. Attribute references use the standard syntax used for all attribute references in Python: . Valid attribute names are all the names that were in the class’s namespace when the class object was created. So, if the class definition looked like this: then and are valid attribute references, returning an integer and a function object, respectively. Class attributes can also be assigned to, so you can change the value of by assignment. is also a valid attribute, returning the docstring belonging to the class: . Class instantiation uses function notation. Just pretend that the class object is a parameterless function that returns a new instance of the class. For example (assuming the above class): creates a new instance of the class and assigns this object to the local variable . The instantiation operation (“calling” a class object) creates an empty object. Many classes like to create objects with instances customized to a specific initial state. Therefore a class may define a special method named , like this: When a class defines an method, class instantiation automatically invokes for the newly created class instance. So in this example, a new, initialized instance can be obtained by: Of course, the method may have arguments for greater flexibility. In that case, arguments given to the class instantiation operator are passed on to . For example, Now what can we do with instance objects? The only operations understood by instance objects are attribute references. There are two kinds of valid attribute names: data attributes and methods. data attributes correspond to “instance variables” in Smalltalk, and to “data members” in C++. Data attributes need not be declared; like local variables, they spring into existence when they are first assigned to. For example, if is the instance of created above, the following piece of code will print the value , without leaving a trace: The other kind of instance attribute reference is a method. A method is a function that “belongs to” an object. Valid method names of an instance object depend on its class. By definition, all attributes of a class that are function objects define corresponding methods of its instances. So in our example, is a valid method reference, since is a function, but is not, since is not. But is not the same thing as — it is a method object, not a function object. Usually, a method is called right after it is bound: In the example, this will return the string . However, it is not necessary to call a method right away: is a method object, and can be stored away and called at a later time. For example: will continue to print until the end of time. What exactly happens when a method is called? You may have noticed that was called without an argument above, even though the function definition for specified an argument. What happened to the argument? Surely Python raises an exception when a function that requires an argument is called without any — even if the argument isn’t actually used… Actually, you may have guessed the answer: the special thing about methods is that the instance object is passed as the first argument of the function. In our example, the call is exactly equivalent to . In general, calling a method with a list of n arguments is equivalent to calling the corresponding function with an argument list that is created by inserting the method’s instance object before the first argument. In general, methods work as follows. When a non-data attribute of an instance is referenced, the instance’s class is searched. If the name denotes a valid class attribute that is a function object, references to both the instance object and the function object are packed into a method object. When the method object is called with an argument list, a new argument list is constructed from the instance object and the argument list, and the function object is called with this new argument list. Generally speaking, instance variables are for data unique to each instance and class variables are for attributes and methods shared by all instances of the class: As discussed in A Word About Names and Objects, shared data can have possibly surprising effects with involving mutable objects such as lists and dictionaries. For example, the tricks list in the following code should not be used as a class variable because just a single list would be shared by all Dog instances: Correct design of the class should use an instance variable instead: # creates a new empty list for each dog\n\nIf the same attribute name occurs in both an instance and in a class, then attribute lookup prioritizes the instance: Data attributes may be referenced by methods as well as by ordinary users (“clients”) of an object. In other words, classes are not usable to implement pure abstract data types. In fact, nothing in Python makes it possible to enforce data hiding — it is all based upon convention. (On the other hand, the Python implementation, written in C, can completely hide implementation details and control access to an object if necessary; this can be used by extensions to Python written in C.) Clients should use data attributes with care — clients may mess up invariants maintained by the methods by stamping on their data attributes. Note that clients may add data attributes of their own to an instance object without affecting the validity of the methods, as long as name conflicts are avoided — again, a naming convention can save a lot of headaches here. There is no shorthand for referencing data attributes (or other methods!) from within methods. I find that this actually increases the readability of methods: there is no chance of confusing local variables and instance variables when glancing through a method. Often, the first argument of a method is called . This is nothing more than a convention: the name has absolutely no special meaning to Python. Note, however, that by not following the convention your code may be less readable to other Python programmers, and it is also conceivable that a class browser program might be written that relies upon such a convention. Any function object that is a class attribute defines a method for instances of that class. It is not necessary that the function definition is textually enclosed in the class definition: assigning a function object to a local variable in the class is also ok. For example: Now , and are all attributes of class that refer to function objects, and consequently they are all methods of instances of — being exactly equivalent to . Note that this practice usually only serves to confuse the reader of a program. Methods may call other methods by using method attributes of the argument: Methods may reference global names in the same way as ordinary functions. The global scope associated with a method is the module containing its definition. (A class is never used as a global scope.) While one rarely encounters a good reason for using global data in a method, there are many legitimate uses of the global scope: for one thing, functions and modules imported into the global scope can be used by methods, as well as functions and classes defined in it. Usually, the class containing the method is itself defined in this global scope, and in the next section we’ll find some good reasons why a method would want to reference its own class. Each value is an object, and therefore has a class (also called its type). It is stored as .\n\nOf course, a language feature would not be worthy of the name “class” without supporting inheritance. The syntax for a derived class definition looks like this: The name must be defined in a namespace accessible from the scope containing the derived class definition. In place of a base class name, other arbitrary expressions are also allowed. This can be useful, for example, when the base class is defined in another module: Execution of a derived class definition proceeds the same as for a base class. When the class object is constructed, the base class is remembered. This is used for resolving attribute references: if a requested attribute is not found in the class, the search proceeds to look in the base class. This rule is applied recursively if the base class itself is derived from some other class. There’s nothing special about instantiation of derived classes: creates a new instance of the class. Method references are resolved as follows: the corresponding class attribute is searched, descending down the chain of base classes if necessary, and the method reference is valid if this yields a function object. Derived classes may override methods of their base classes. Because methods have no special privileges when calling other methods of the same object, a method of a base class that calls another method defined in the same base class may end up calling a method of a derived class that overrides it. (For C++ programmers: all methods in Python are effectively .) An overriding method in a derived class may in fact want to extend rather than simply replace the base class method of the same name. There is a simple way to call the base class method directly: just call . This is occasionally useful to clients as well. (Note that this only works if the base class is accessible as in the global scope.) Python has two built-in functions that work with inheritance:\n• None Use to check an instance’s type: will be only if is or some class derived from .\n• None Use to check class inheritance: is since is a subclass of . However, is since is not a subclass of . Python supports a form of multiple inheritance as well. A class definition with multiple base classes looks like this: For most purposes, in the simplest cases, you can think of the search for attributes inherited from a parent class as depth-first, left-to-right, not searching twice in the same class where there is an overlap in the hierarchy. Thus, if an attribute is not found in , it is searched for in , then (recursively) in the base classes of , and if it was not found there, it was searched for in , and so on. In fact, it is slightly more complex than that; the method resolution order changes dynamically to support cooperative calls to . This approach is known in some other multiple-inheritance languages as call-next-method and is more powerful than the super call found in single-inheritance languages. Dynamic ordering is necessary because all cases of multiple inheritance exhibit one or more diamond relationships (where at least one of the parent classes can be accessed through multiple paths from the bottommost class). For example, all classes inherit from , so any case of multiple inheritance provides more than one path to reach . To keep the base classes from being accessed more than once, the dynamic algorithm linearizes the search order in a way that preserves the left-to-right ordering specified in each class, that calls each parent only once, and that is monotonic (meaning that a class can be subclassed without affecting the precedence order of its parents). Taken together, these properties make it possible to design reliable and extensible classes with multiple inheritance. For more detail, see The Python 2.3 Method Resolution Order.\n\n“Private” instance variables that cannot be accessed except from inside an object don’t exist in Python. However, there is a convention that is followed by most Python code: a name prefixed with an underscore (e.g. ) should be treated as a non-public part of the API (whether it is a function, a method or a data member). It should be considered an implementation detail and subject to change without notice. Since there is a valid use-case for class-private members (namely to avoid name clashes of names with names defined by subclasses), there is limited support for such a mechanism, called name mangling. Any identifier of the form (at least two leading underscores, at most one trailing underscore) is textually replaced with , where is the current class name with leading underscore(s) stripped.

This can even be useful in special circumstances, such as in the debugger.

Attributes are variables defined inside the class and represent the properties of the class. Attributes can be accessed using the dot . operator (e.g., MyClass.my_attribute).\n\nAn Object is an instance of a Class. It represents a specific implementation of the class and holds its own data.\n\nNow, let’s create an object from Dog class.\n\nsound attribute is a class attribute.

It automatically initializes object attributes when an object is created.\n• species: A class attribute shared by all instances of the class.\n• __init__ method: Initializes the name and age attributes when a new object is created.\n• dog1 = Dog(“Buddy”, 3): Creates an object of the Dog class with name as “Buddy” and age as 3.\n• dog1.name: Accesses the instance attribute name of the dog1 object.\n• dog1.species: Accesses the class attribute species of the dog1 object.\n\nself parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class. It allows us to access the attributes and methods of the object.\n• None Inside bark(), self.name accesses the specific dog’s name and prints it.\n• None When we call dog1.bark(), Python automatically passes dog1 as self, allowing access to its attributes.\n\n__str__ method in Python allows us to define a custom string representation of an object. By default, when we print an object or convert it to a string using str(), Python uses the default implementation, which returns a string like <__main__.ClassName object at 0x00000123>.\n• __str__ Implementation: Defined as a method in the Dog class. Uses the self parameter to access the instance’s attributes (name and age).\n• Readable Output: When print(dog1) is called, Python automatically uses the __str__ method to get a string representation of the object. Without __str__, calling print(dog1) would produce something like <__main__.Dog object at 0x00000123>.\n\nIn Python, variables defined in a class can be either class variables or instance variables, and understanding the distinction between them is crucial for object-oriented programming.\n\nThese are the variables that are shared across all instances of a class.

        "document": "Objects are Python’s abstraction for data. All data in a Python program is represented by objects or by relations between objects. (In a sense, and in conformance to Von Neumann’s model of a “stored program computer”, code is also represented by objects.) Every object has an identity, a type and a value. An object’s identity never changes once it has been created; you may think of it as the object’s address in memory. The operator compares the identity of two objects; the function returns an integer representing its identity. CPython implementation detail: For CPython, is the memory address where is stored. An object’s type determines the operations that the object supports (e.g., “does it have a length?”) and also defines the possible values for objects of that type. The function returns an object’s type (which is an object itself). Like its identity, an object’s type is also unchangeable. The value of some objects can change. Objects whose value can change are said to be mutable; objects whose value is unchangeable once they are created are called immutable. (The value of an immutable container object that contains a reference to a mutable object can change when the latter’s value is changed; however the container is still considered immutable, because the collection of objects it contains cannot be changed. So, immutability is not strictly the same as having an unchangeable value, it is more subtle.) An object’s mutability is determined by its type; for instance, numbers, strings and tuples are immutable, while dictionaries and lists are mutable. Objects are never explicitly destroyed; however, when they become unreachable they may be garbage-collected. An implementation is allowed to postpone garbage collection or omit it altogether — it is a matter of implementation quality how garbage collection is implemented, as long as no objects are collected that are still reachable. CPython implementation detail: CPython currently uses a reference-counting scheme with (optional) delayed detection of cyclically linked garbage, which collects most objects as soon as they become unreachable, but is not guaranteed to collect garbage containing circular references. See the documentation of the module for information on controlling the collection of cyclic garbage. Other implementations act differently and CPython may change. Do not depend on immediate finalization of objects when they become unreachable (so you should always close files explicitly). Note that the use of the implementation’s tracing or debugging facilities may keep objects alive that would normally be collectable. Also note that catching an exception with a … statement may keep objects alive. Some objects contain references to “external” resources such as open files or windows. It is understood that these resources are freed when the object is garbage-collected, but since garbage collection is not guaranteed to happen, such objects also provide an explicit way to release the external resource, usually a method. Programs are strongly recommended to explicitly close such objects. The … statement and the statement provide convenient ways to do this. Some objects contain references to other objects; these are called containers. Examples of containers are tuples, lists and dictionaries. The references are part of a container’s value. In most cases, when we talk about the value of a container, we imply the values, not the identities of the contained objects; however, when we talk about the mutability of a container, only the identities of the immediately contained objects are implied. So, if an immutable container (like a tuple) contains a reference to a mutable object, its value changes if that mutable object is changed. Types affect almost all aspects of object behavior. Even the importance of object identity is affected in some sense: for immutable types, operations that compute new values may actually return a reference to any existing object with the same type and value, while for mutable objects this is not allowed. For example, after , a and b may or may not refer to the same object with the value one, depending on the implementation. This is because is an immutable type, so the reference to can be reused. This behaviour depends on the implementation used, so should not be relied upon, but is something to be aware of when making use of object identity tests. However, after , c and d are guaranteed to refer to two different, unique, newly created empty lists. (Note that assigns the same object to both e and f.)"

        "document": "Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying its state.\n\nCompared with other programming languages, Python’s class mechanism adds classes with a minimum of new syntax and semantics. It is a mixture of the class mechanisms found in C++ and Modula-3. Python classes provide all the standard features of Object Oriented Programming: the class inheritance mechanism allows multiple base classes, a derived class can override any methods of its base class or classes, and a method can call the method of a base class with the same name. Objects can contain arbitrary amounts and kinds of data. As is true for modules, classes partake of the dynamic nature of Python: they are created at runtime, and can be modified further after creation.\n\nIn C++ terminology, normally class members (including the data members) are public (except see below Private Variables), and all member functions are virtual. As in Modula-3, there are no shorthands for referencing the object’s members from its methods: the method function is declared with an explicit first argument representing the object, which is provided implicitly by the call. As in Smalltalk, classes themselves are objects. This provides semantics for importing and renaming. Unlike C++ and Modula-3, built-in types can be used as base classes for extension by the user. Also, like in C++, most built-in operators with special syntax (arithmetic operators, subscripting etc.) can be redefined for class instances.\n\nBefore introducing classes, I first have to tell you something about Python’s scope rules. Class definitions play some neat tricks with namespaces, and you need to know how scopes and namespaces work to fully understand what’s going on. Incidentally, knowledge about this subject is useful for any advanced Python programmer. A namespace is a mapping from names to objects. Most namespaces are currently implemented as Python dictionaries, but that’s normally not noticeable in any way (except for performance), and it may change in the future. Examples of namespaces are: the set of built-in names (containing functions such as , and built-in exception names); the global names in a module; and the local names in a function invocation. In a sense the set of attributes of an object also form a namespace. The important thing to know about namespaces is that there is absolutely no relation between names in different namespaces; for instance, two different modules may both define a function without confusion — users of the modules must prefix it with the module name. By the way, I use the word attribute for any name following a dot — for example, in the expression , is an attribute of the object . Strictly speaking, references to names in modules are attribute references: in the expression , is a module object and is an attribute of it. In this case there happens to be a straightforward mapping between the module’s attributes and the global names defined in the module: they share the same namespace! Attributes may be read-only or writable. In the latter case, assignment to attributes is possible. Module attributes are writable: you can write . Writable attributes may also be deleted with the statement. For example, will remove the attribute from the object named by . Namespaces are created at different moments and have different lifetimes. The namespace containing the built-in names is created when the Python interpreter starts up, and is never deleted. The global namespace for a module is created when the module definition is read in; normally, module namespaces also last until the interpreter quits. The statements executed by the top-level invocation of the interpreter, either read from a script file or interactively, are considered part of a module called , so they have their own global namespace. (The built-in names actually also live in a module; this is called .) The local namespace for a function is created when the function is called, and deleted when the function returns or raises an exception that is not handled within the function. (Actually, forgetting would be a better way to describe what actually happens.) Of course, recursive invocations each have their own local namespace. A scope is a textual region of a Python program where a namespace is directly accessible. “Directly accessible” here means that an unqualified reference to a name attempts to find the name in the namespace. Although scopes are determined statically, they are used dynamically. At any time during execution, there are 3 or 4 nested scopes whose namespaces are directly accessible:\n• None the innermost scope, which is searched first, contains the local names\n• None the scopes of any enclosing functions, which are searched starting with the nearest enclosing scope, contain non-local, but also non-global names\n• None the next-to-last scope contains the current module’s global names\n• None the outermost scope (searched last) is the namespace containing built-in names If a name is declared global, then all references and assignments go directly to the next-to-last scope containing the module’s global names. To rebind variables found outside of the innermost scope, the statement can be used; if not declared nonlocal, those variables are read-only (an attempt to write to such a variable will simply create a new local variable in the innermost scope, leaving the identically named outer variable unchanged). Usually, the local scope references the local names of the (textually) current function. Outside functions, the local scope references the same namespace as the global scope: the module’s namespace. Class definitions place yet another namespace in the local scope. It is important to realize that scopes are determined textually: the global scope of a function defined in a module is that module’s namespace, no matter from where or by what alias the function is called. On the other hand, the actual search for names is done dynamically, at run time — however, the language definition is evolving towards static name resolution, at “compile” time, so don’t rely on dynamic name resolution! (In fact, local variables are already determined statically.) A special quirk of Python is that – if no or statement is in effect – assignments to names always go into the innermost scope. Assignments do not copy data — they just bind names to objects. The same is true for deletions: the statement removes the binding of from the namespace referenced by the local scope. In fact, all operations that introduce new names use the local scope: in particular, statements and function definitions bind the module or function name in the local scope. The statement can be used to indicate that particular variables live in the global scope and should be rebound there; the statement indicates that particular variables live in an enclosing scope and should be rebound there. This is an example demonstrating how to reference the different scopes and namespaces, and how and affect variable binding: The output of the example code is: After local assignment: test spam After nonlocal assignment: nonlocal spam After global assignment: nonlocal spam In global scope: global spam Note how the local assignment (which is default) didn’t change scope_test's binding of spam. The assignment changed scope_test's binding of spam, and the assignment changed the module-level binding. You can also see that there was no previous binding for spam before the assignment.\n\nA First Look at Classes¶ Classes introduce a little bit of new syntax, three new object types, and some new semantics. The simplest form of class definition looks like this: Class definitions, like function definitions ( statements) must be executed before they have any effect. (You could conceivably place a class definition in a branch of an statement, or inside a function.) In practice, the statements inside a class definition will usually be function definitions, but other statements are allowed, and sometimes useful — we’ll come back to this later. The function definitions inside a class normally have a peculiar form of argument list, dictated by the calling conventions for methods — again, this is explained later. When a class definition is entered, a new namespace is created, and used as the local scope — thus, all assignments to local variables go into this new namespace. In particular, function definitions bind the name of the new function here. When a class definition is left normally (via the end), a class object is created. This is basically a wrapper around the contents of the namespace created by the class definition; we’ll learn more about class objects in the next section. The original local scope (the one in effect just before the class definition was entered) is reinstated, and the class object is bound here to the class name given in the class definition header ( in the example). Class objects support two kinds of operations: attribute references and instantiation. Attribute references use the standard syntax used for all attribute references in Python: . Valid attribute names are all the names that were in the class’s namespace when the class object was created. So, if the class definition looked like this: then and are valid attribute references, returning an integer and a function object, respectively. Class attributes can also be assigned to, so you can change the value of by assignment. is also a valid attribute, returning the docstring belonging to the class: . Class instantiation uses function notation. Just pretend that the class object is a parameterless function that returns a new instance of the class. For example (assuming the above class): creates a new instance of the class and assigns this object to the local variable . The instantiation operation (“calling” a class object) creates an empty object. Many classes like to create objects with instances customized to a specific initial state. Therefore a class may define a special method named , like this: When a class defines an method, class instantiation automatically invokes for the newly created class instance. So in this example, a new, initialized instance can be obtained by: Of course, the method may have arguments for greater flexibility. In that case, arguments given to the class instantiation operator are passed on to . For example, Now what can we do with instance objects? The only operations understood by instance objects are attribute references. There are two kinds of valid attribute names: data attributes and methods. data attributes correspond to “instance variables” in Smalltalk, and to “data members” in C++. Data attributes need not be declared; like local variables, they spring into existence when they are first assigned to. For example, if is the instance of created above, the following piece of code will print the value , without leaving a trace: The other kind of instance attribute reference is a method. A method is a function that “belongs to” an object. Valid method names of an instance object depend on its class. By definition, all attributes of a class that are function objects define corresponding methods of its instances. So in our example, is a valid method reference, since is a function, but is not, since is not. But is not the same thing as — it is a method object, not a function object. Usually, a method is called right after it is bound: In the example, this will return the string . However, it is not necessary to call a method right away: is a method object, and can be stored away and called at a later time. For example: will continue to print until the end of time. What exactly happens when a method is called? You may have noticed that was called without an argument above, even though the function definition for specified an argument. What happened to the argument? Surely Python raises an exception when a function that requires an argument is called without any — even if the argument isn’t actually used… Actually, you may have guessed the answer: the special thing about methods is that the instance object is passed as the first argument of the function. In our example, the call is exactly equivalent to . In general, calling a method with a list of n arguments is equivalent to calling the corresponding function with an argument list that is created by inserting the method’s instance object before the first argument. In general, methods work as follows. When a non-data attribute of an instance is referenced, the instance’s class is searched. If the name denotes a valid class attribute that is a function object, references to both the instance object and the function object are packed into a method object. When the method object is called with an argument list, a new argument list is constructed from the instance object and the argument list, and the function object is called with this new argument list. Generally speaking, instance variables are for data unique to each instance and class variables are for attributes and methods shared by all instances of the class: As discussed in A Word About Names and Objects, shared data can have possibly surprising effects with involving mutable objects such as lists and dictionaries. For example, the tricks list in the following code should not be used as a class variable because just a single list would be shared by all Dog instances: Correct design of the class should use an instance variable instead: # creates a new empty list for each dog\n\nIf the same attribute name occurs in both an instance and in a class, then attribute lookup prioritizes the instance: Data attributes may be referenced by methods as well as by ordinary users (“clients”) of an object. In other words, classes are not usable to implement pure abstract data types. In fact, nothing in Python makes it possible to enforce data hiding — it is all based upon convention. (On the other hand, the Python implementation, written in C, can completely hide implementation details and control access to an object if necessary; this can be used by extensions to Python written in C.) Clients should use data attributes with care — clients may mess up invariants maintained by the methods by stamping on their data attributes. Note that clients may add data attributes of their own to an instance object without affecting the validity of the methods, as long as name conflicts are avoided — again, a naming convention can save a lot of headaches here. There is no shorthand for referencing data attributes (or other methods!) from within methods. I find that this actually increases the readability of methods: there is no chance of confusing local variables and instance variables when glancing through a method. Often, the first argument of a method is called . This is nothing more than a convention: the name has absolutely no special meaning to Python. Note, however, that by not following the convention your code may be less readable to other Python programmers, and it is also conceivable that a class browser program might be written that relies upon such a convention. Any function object that is a class attribute defines a method for instances of that class. It is not necessary that the function definition is textually enclosed in the class definition: assigning a function object to a local variable in the class is also ok. For example: Now , and are all attributes of class that refer to function objects, and consequently they are all methods of instances of — being exactly equivalent to . Note that this practice usually only serves to confuse the reader of a program. Methods may call other methods by using method attributes of the argument: Methods may reference global names in the same way as ordinary functions. The global scope associated with a method is the module containing its definition. (A class is never used as a global scope.) While one rarely encounters a good reason for using global data in a method, there are many legitimate uses of the global scope: for one thing, functions and modules imported into the global scope can be used by methods, as well as functions and classes defined in it. Usually, the class containing the method is itself defined in this global scope, and in the next section we’ll find some good reasons why a method would want to reference its own class. Each value is an object, and therefore has a class (also called its type). It is stored as .\n\nOf course, a language feature would not be worthy of the name “class” without supporting inheritance. The syntax for a derived class definition looks like this: The name must be defined in a namespace accessible from the scope containing the derived class definition. In place of a base class name, other arbitrary expressions are also allowed. This can be useful, for example, when the base class is defined in another module: Execution of a derived class definition proceeds the same as for a base class. When the class object is constructed, the base class is remembered. This is used for resolving attribute references: if a requested attribute is not found in the class, the search proceeds to look in the base class. This rule is applied recursively if the base class itself is derived from some other class. There’s nothing special about instantiation of derived classes: creates a new instance of the class. Method references are resolved as follows: the corresponding class attribute is searched, descending down the chain of base classes if necessary, and the method reference is valid if this yields a function object. Derived classes may override methods of their base classes. Because methods have no special privileges when calling other methods of the same object, a method of a base class that calls another method defined in the same base class may end up calling a method of a derived class that overrides it. (For C++ programmers: all methods in Python are effectively .) An overriding method in a derived class may in fact want to extend rather than simply replace the base class method of the same name. There is a simple way to call the base class method directly: just call . This is occasionally useful to clients as well. (Note that this only works if the base class is accessible as in the global scope.) Python has two built-in functions that work with inheritance:\n• None Use to check an instance’s type: will be only if is or some class derived from .\n• None Use to check class inheritance: is since is a subclass of . However, is since is not a subclass of . Python supports a form of multiple inheritance as well. A class definition with multiple base classes looks like this: For most purposes, in the simplest cases, you can think of the search for attributes inherited from a parent class as depth-first, left-to-right, not searching twice in the same class where there is an overlap in the hierarchy. Thus, if an attribute is not found in , it is searched for in , then (recursively) in the base classes of , and if it was not found there, it was searched for in , and so on. In fact, it is slightly more complex than that; the method resolution order changes dynamically to support cooperative calls to . This approach is known in some other multiple-inheritance languages as call-next-method and is more powerful than the super call found in single-inheritance languages. Dynamic ordering is necessary because all cases of multiple inheritance exhibit one or more diamond relationships (where at least one of the parent classes can be accessed through multiple paths from the bottommost class). For example, all classes inherit from , so any case of multiple inheritance provides more than one path to reach . To keep the base classes from being accessed more than once, the dynamic algorithm linearizes the search order in a way that preserves the left-to-right ordering specified in each class, that calls each parent only once, and that is monotonic (meaning that a class can be subclassed without affecting the precedence order of its parents). Taken together, these properties make it possible to design reliable and extensible classes with multiple inheritance. For more detail, see The Python 2.3 Method Resolution Order.\n\n“Private” instance variables that cannot be accessed except from inside an object don’t exist in Python. However, there is a convention that is followed by most Python code: a name prefixed with an underscore (e.g. ) should be treated as a non-public part of the API (whether it is a function, a method or a data member). It should be considered an implementation detail and subject to change without notice. Since there is a valid use-case for class-private members (namely to avoid name clashes of names with names defined by subclasses), there is limited support for such a mechanism, called name mangling. Any identifier of the form (at least two leading underscores, at most one trailing underscore) is textually replaced with , where is the current class name with leading underscore(s) stripped. This mangling is done without regard to the syntactic position of the identifier, as long as it occurs within the definition of a class. The private name mangling specifications for details and special cases. Name mangling is helpful for letting subclasses override methods without breaking intraclass method calls. For example: # provides new signature for update() # but does not break __init__() The above example would work even if were to introduce a identifier since it is replaced with in the class and in the class respectively. Note that the mangling rules are designed mostly to avoid accidents; it still is possible to access or modify a variable that is considered private. This can even be useful in special circumstances, such as in the debugger. Notice that code passed to or does not consider the classname of the invoking class to be the current class; this is similar to the effect of the statement, the effect of which is likewise restricted to code that is byte-compiled together. The same restriction applies to , and , as well as when referencing directly."

An object’s type determines the operations that the object supports (e.g., “does it have a length?”) and also defines the possible values for objects of that type. The function returns an object’s type (which is an object itself). Like its identity, an object’s type is also unchangeable. The value of some objects can change. Objects whose value can change are said to be mutable; objects whose value is unchangeable once they are created are called immutable. (The value of an immutable container object that contains a reference to a mutable object can change when the latter’s value is changed; however the container is still considered immutable, because the collection of objects it contains cannot be changed. So, immutability is not strictly the same as having an unchangeable value, it is more subtle.) An object’s mutability is determined by its type; for instance, numbers, strings and tuples are immutable, while dictionaries and lists are mutable. Objects are never explicitly destroyed; however, when they become unreachable they may be garbage-collected. An implementation is allowed to postpone garbage collection or omit it altogether — it is a matter of implementation quality how garbage collection is implemented, as long as no objects are collected that are still reachable. CPython implementation detail: CPython currently uses a reference-counting scheme with (optional) delayed detection of cyclically linked garbage, which collects most objects as soon as they become unreachable, but is not guaranteed to collect garbage containing circular references. See the documentation of the module for information on controlling the collection of cyclic garbage. Other implementations act differently and CPython may change. Do not depend on immediate finalization of objects when they become unreachable (so you should always close files explicitly). Note that the use of the implementation’s tracing or debugging facilities may keep objects alive that would normally be collectable. Also note that catching an exception with a … statement may keep objects alive. Some objects contain references to “external” resources such as open files or windows. It is understood that these resources are freed when the object is garbage-collected, but since garbage collection is not guaranteed to happen, such objects also provide an explicit way to release the external resource, usually a method. Programs are strongly recommended to explicitly close such objects. The … statement and the statement provide convenient ways to do this. Some objects contain references to other objects; these are called containers. Examples of containers are tuples, lists and dictionaries. The references are part of a container’s value. In most cases, when we talk about the value of a container, we imply the values, not the identities of the contained objects; however, when we talk about the mutability of a container, only the identities of the immediately contained objects are implied. So, if an immutable container (like a tuple) contains a reference to a mutable object, its value changes if that mutable object is changed. Types affect almost all aspects of object behavior. Even the importance of object identity is affected in some sense: for immutable types, operations that compute new values may actually return a reference to any existing object with the same type and value, while for mutable objects this is not allowed. For example, after , a and b may or may not refer to the same object with the value one, depending on the implementation. This is because is an immutable type, so the reference to can be reused. This behaviour depends on the implementation used, so should not be relied upon, but is something to be aware of when making use of object identity tests. However, after , c and d are guaranteed to refer to two different, unique, newly created empty lists. (Note that assigns the same object to both e and f.)"

        "document": "Python classes provide a great framework for creating objects that can handle complex data structures, processes, pipelines, algorithms, or machine learning models. Object Oriented Programming (OOP) offers a ton of modularity and reusability, which enables data scientists and machine learning engineers to develop flexible and scalable codebases. Personally, I find structuring my code as classes and objects extremely useful for retrospective development work — whether it is adding new features, modifying existing ones, or fixing annoying bugs.\n\nIn Python, there are generally three types of methods: instance methods, static methods, and class methods.\n\nInstance methods (the ones you define with as the first argument) take an instance of the class as an implicit input and allow the user to interact with the class attributes. Instance methods are incredibly powerful because they can access and modify the data and configurations within an instance to perform complex calculations and implement sophisticated logic, while being highly readable and maintainable."
