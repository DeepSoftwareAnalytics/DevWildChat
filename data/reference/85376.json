I have meddled a bit with it in earlier Projects but I always find myself in this very weird and messy hundreds of lines long character controller script, which also does not feel good with unitys mecanim character controller. Has anyone experienced similar issues? Or has some resources for maybe a nice design pattern or good way to approach this? I am talking about a fairly common controller, with things like running, maybe 3 different attacks, a dash or roll and blocking or getting hit."
