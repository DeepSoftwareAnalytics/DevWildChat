        "document": "This module provides various time-related functions. For related functionality, see also the and modules.\n\nAlthough this module is always available, not all functions are available on all platforms. Most of the functions defined in this module call platform C library functions with the same name. It may sometimes be helpful to consult the platform documentation, because the semantics of these functions varies among platforms.\n\nAn explanation of some terminology and conventions is in order.\n• None The epoch is the point where the time starts, the return value of . It is January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 (UTC) on all platforms.\n• None The term seconds since the epoch refers to the total number of elapsed seconds since the epoch, typically excluding leap seconds. Leap seconds are excluded from this total on all POSIX-compliant platforms.\n• None The functions in this module may not handle dates and times before the epoch or far in the future. The cut-off point in the future is determined by the C library; for 32-bit systems, it is typically in 2038.\n• None Function can parse 2-digit years when given format code. When 2-digit years are parsed, they are converted according to the POSIX and ISO C standards: values 69–99 are mapped to 1969–1999, and values 0–68 are mapped to 2000–2068.\n• None UTC is Coordinated Universal Time and superseded Greenwich Mean Time or GMT as the basis of international timekeeping. The acronym UTC is not a mistake but conforms to an earlier, language-agnostic naming scheme for time standards such as UT0, UT1, and UT2.\n• None DST is Daylight Saving Time, an adjustment of the timezone by (usually) one hour during part of the year. DST rules are magic (determined by local law) and can change from year to year. The C library has a table containing the local rules (often it is read from a system file for flexibility) and is the only source of True Wisdom in this respect.\n• None The precision of the various real-time functions may be less than suggested by the units in which their value or argument is expressed. E.g. on most Unix systems, the clock “ticks” only 50 or 100 times a second.\n• None On the other hand, the precision of and is better than their Unix equivalents: times are expressed as floating-point numbers, returns the most accurate time available (using Unix where available), and will accept a time with a nonzero fraction (Unix is used to implement this, where available).\n• None The time value as returned by , , and , and accepted by , and , is a sequence of 9 integers. The return values of , , and also offer attribute names for individual fields. See for a description of these objects. Changed in version 3.3: The type was extended to provide the and attributes when platform supports corresponding members. Changed in version 3.6: The attributes and are now available on all platforms.\n• None Use the following functions to convert between time representations:\n\nConvert a tuple or representing a time as returned by or to a string of the following form: . The day field is two characters long and is space padded if the day is a single digit, e.g.: . If t is not provided, the current time as returned by is used. Locale information is not used by . Unlike the C function of the same name, does not add a trailing newline. Return the clk_id of the thread-specific CPU-time clock for the specified thread_id. Use or the attribute of objects to get a suitable value for thread_id. Passing an invalid or expired thread_id may result in undefined behavior, such as segmentation fault. See the man page for pthread_getcpuclockid(3) for further information. Return the resolution (precision) of the specified clock clk_id. Refer to Clock ID Constants for a list of accepted values for clk_id. Return the time of the specified clock clk_id. Refer to Clock ID Constants for a list of accepted values for clk_id. Use to avoid the precision loss caused by the type. Similar to but return time as nanoseconds. Set the time of the specified clock clk_id. Currently, is the only accepted value for clk_id. Use to avoid the precision loss caused by the type. Similar to but set time with nanoseconds. Convert a time expressed in seconds since the epoch to a string of a form: representing local time. The day field is two characters long and is space padded if the day is a single digit, e.g.: . If secs is not provided or , the current time as returned by is used. is equivalent to . Locale information is not used by . Get information on the specified clock as a namespace object. Supported clock names and the corresponding functions to read their value are: The result has the following attributes:\n• None adjustable: if the clock can be changed automatically (e.g. by a NTP daemon) or manually by the system administrator, otherwise\n• None implementation: The name of the underlying C function used to get the clock value. Refer to Clock ID Constants for possible values.\n• None monotonic: if the clock cannot go backward, otherwise\n• None resolution: The resolution of the clock in seconds ( ) Convert a time expressed in seconds since the epoch to a in UTC in which the dst flag is always zero. If secs is not provided or , the current time as returned by is used. Fractions of a second are ignored. See above for a description of the object. See for the inverse of this function. Like but converts to local time. If secs is not provided or , the current time as returned by is used. The dst flag is set to when DST applies to the given time. may raise , if the timestamp is outside the range of values supported by the platform C or functions, and on or failure. It’s common for this to be restricted to years between 1970 and 2038. This is the inverse function of . Its argument is the or full 9-tuple (since the dst flag is needed; use as the dst flag if it is unknown) which expresses the time in local time, not UTC. It returns a floating-point number, for compatibility with . If the input value cannot be represented as a valid time, either or will be raised (which depends on whether the invalid value is caught by Python or the underlying C libraries). The earliest date for which it can generate a time is platform-dependent. Return the value (in fractional seconds) of a monotonic clock, i.e. a clock that cannot go backwards. The clock is not affected by system clock updates. The reference point of the returned value is undefined, so that only the difference between the results of two calls is valid. Use to avoid the precision loss caused by the type. Changed in version 3.5: The function is now always available and always system-wide. Changed in version 3.10: On macOS, the function is now system-wide. Similar to , but return time as nanoseconds. Return the value (in fractional seconds) of a performance counter, i.e. a clock with the highest available resolution to measure a short duration. It does include time elapsed during sleep and is system-wide. The reference point of the returned value is undefined, so that only the difference between the results of two calls is valid. CPython implementation detail: On CPython, use the same clock as and is a monotonic clock, i.e. a clock that cannot go backwards. Use to avoid the precision loss caused by the type. Changed in version 3.10: On Windows, the function is now system-wide. Changed in version 3.13: Use the same clock as . Similar to , but return time as nanoseconds. Return the value (in fractional seconds) of the sum of the system and user CPU time of the current process. It does not include time elapsed during sleep. It is process-wide by definition. The reference point of the returned value is undefined, so that only the difference between the results of two calls is valid. Use to avoid the precision loss caused by the type. Similar to but return time as nanoseconds. Suspend execution of the calling thread for the given number of seconds. The argument may be a floating-point number to indicate a more precise sleep time. If the sleep is interrupted by a signal and no exception is raised by the signal handler, the sleep is restarted with a recomputed timeout. The suspension time may be longer than requested by an arbitrary amount, because of the scheduling of other activity in the system. On Windows, if secs is zero, the thread relinquishes the remainder of its time slice to any other thread that is ready to run. If there are no other threads ready to run, the function returns immediately, and the thread continues execution. On Windows 8.1 and newer the implementation uses a high-resolution timer which provides resolution of 100 nanoseconds. If secs is zero, is used.\n• None Use if available (resolution: 1 nanosecond);\n• None Or use if available (resolution: 1 nanosecond); To emulate a “no-op”, use instead of . To voluntarily relinquish the CPU, specify a real-time scheduling policy and use instead. Changed in version 3.5: The function now sleeps at least secs even if the sleep is interrupted by a signal, except if the signal handler raises an exception (see PEP 475 for the rationale). Changed in version 3.11: On Unix, the and functions are now used if available. On Windows, a waitable timer is now used. Convert a tuple or representing a time as returned by or to a string as specified by the format argument. If t is not provided, the current time as returned by is used. format must be a string. is raised if any field in t is outside of the allowed range. 0 is a legal argument for any position in the time tuple; if it is normally illegal the value is forced to a correct one. The following directives can be embedded in the format string. They are shown without the optional field width and precision specification, and are replaced by the indicated characters in the result: Day of the month as a decimal number [01,31]. Day of the year as a decimal number [001,366]. Locale’s equivalent of either AM or PM. Week number of the year (Sunday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number [00,53]. All days in a new year preceding the first Sunday are considered to be in week 0. Day of the week (Monday is 1; Sunday is 7) as a decimal number [1, 7]. Week number of the year (Monday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number [00,53]. All days in a new year preceding the first Monday are considered to be in week 0. Time zone offset indicating a positive or negative time difference from UTC/GMT of the form +HHMM or -HHMM, where H represents decimal hour digits and M represents decimal minute digits [-23:59, +23:59]. Time zone name (no characters if no time zone exists). Deprecated. ISO 8601 year (similar to but follows the rules for the ISO 8601 calendar year). The year starts with the week that contains the first Thursday of the calendar year. ISO 8601 week number (as a decimal number [01,53]). The first week of the year is the one that contains the first Thursday of the year. Weeks start on Monday.\n• None The format directive only applies to , not to . However, see also and where the format directive applies to microseconds.\n• None When used with the function, the directive only affects the output hour field if the directive is used to parse the hour.\n• None The range really is to ; value is valid in timestamps representing leap seconds and value is supported for historical reasons.\n• None When used with the function, and are only used in calculations when the day of the week and the year are specified. Here is an example, a format for dates compatible with that specified in the RFC 2822 Internet email standard. Additional directives may be supported on certain platforms, but only the ones listed here have a meaning standardized by ANSI C. To see the full set of format codes supported on your platform, consult the strftime(3) documentation. On some platforms, an optional field width and precision specification can immediately follow the initial of a directive in the following order; this is also not portable. The field width is normally 2 except for where it is 3. Parse a string representing a time according to a format. The return value is a as returned by or . The format parameter uses the same directives as those used by ; it defaults to which matches the formatting returned by . If string cannot be parsed according to format, or if it has excess data after parsing, is raised. The default values used to fill in any missing data when more accurate values cannot be inferred are . Both string and format must be strings. Support for the directive is based on the values contained in and whether is true. Because of this, it is platform-specific except for recognizing UTC and GMT which are always known (and are considered to be non-daylight savings timezones). Only the directives specified in the documentation are supported. Because is implemented per platform it can sometimes offer more directives than those listed. But is independent of any platform and thus does not necessarily support all directives available that are not documented as supported. The type of the time value sequence returned by , , and . It is an object with a named tuple interface: values can be accessed by index and by attribute name. The following values are present: Note that unlike the C structure, the month value is a range of [1, 12], not [0, 11]. In calls to , may be set to 1 when daylight savings time is in effect, and 0 when it is not. A value of -1 indicates that this is not known, and will usually result in the correct state being filled in. When a tuple with an incorrect length is passed to a function expecting a , or having elements of the wrong type, a is raised. Return the time in seconds since the epoch as a floating-point number. The handling of leap seconds is platform dependent. On Windows and most Unix systems, the leap seconds are not counted towards the time in seconds since the epoch. This is commonly referred to as Unix time. Note that even though the time is always returned as a floating-point number, not all systems provide time with a better precision than 1 second. While this function normally returns non-decreasing values, it can return a lower value than a previous call if the system clock has been set back between the two calls. The number returned by may be converted into a more common time format (i.e. year, month, day, hour, etc…) in UTC by passing it to function or in local time by passing it to the function. In both cases a object is returned, from which the components of the calendar date may be accessed as attributes. Use to avoid the precision loss caused by the type. Similar to but returns time as an integer number of nanoseconds since the epoch. Return the value (in fractional seconds) of the sum of the system and user CPU time of the current thread. It does not include time elapsed during sleep. It is thread-specific by definition. The reference point of the returned value is undefined, so that only the difference between the results of two calls in the same thread is valid. Use to avoid the precision loss caused by the type. Similar to but return time as nanoseconds. Reset the time conversion rules used by the library routines. The environment variable specifies how this is done. It will also set the variables (from the environment variable), (non-DST seconds West of UTC), (DST seconds west of UTC) and (to 0 if this timezone does not have any daylight saving time rules, or to nonzero if there is a time, past, present or future when daylight saving time applies). Although in many cases, changing the environment variable may affect the output of functions like without calling , this behavior should not be relied on. The environment variable should contain no whitespace. The standard format of the environment variable is (whitespace added for clarity): Where the components are: Three or more alphanumerics giving the timezone abbreviations. These will be propagated into time.tzname The offset has the form: . This indicates the value added the local time to arrive at UTC. If preceded by a ‘-’, the timezone is east of the Prime Meridian; otherwise, it is west. If no offset follows dst, summer time is assumed to be one hour ahead of standard time. Indicates when to change to and back from DST. The format of the start and end dates are one of the following: The Julian day n (1 <= n <= 365). Leap days are not counted, so in all years February 28 is day 59 and March 1 is day 60. The zero-based Julian day (0 <= n <= 365). Leap days are counted, and it is possible to refer to February 29. The d’th day (0 <= d <= 6) of week n of month m of the year (1 <= n <= 5, 1 <= m <= 12, where week 5 means “the last d day in month m” which may occur in either the fourth or the fifth week). Week 1 is the first week in which the d’th day occurs. Day zero is a Sunday. has the same format as except that no leading sign (‘-’ or ‘+’) is allowed. The default, if time is not given, is 02:00:00. On many Unix systems (including *BSD, Linux, Solaris, and Darwin), it is more convenient to use the system’s zoneinfo (tzfile(5)) database to specify the timezone rules. To do this, set the environment variable to the path of the required timezone datafile, relative to the root of the systems ‘zoneinfo’ timezone database, usually located at . For example, , , or .\n\nThe offset of the local DST timezone, in seconds west of UTC, if one is defined. This is negative if the local DST timezone is east of UTC (as in Western Europe, including the UK). Only use this if is nonzero. See note below. Nonzero if a DST timezone is defined. See note below. The offset of the local (non-DST) timezone, in seconds west of UTC (negative in most of Western Europe, positive in the US, zero in the UK). See note below. A tuple of two strings: the first is the name of the local non-DST timezone, the second is the name of the local DST timezone. If no DST timezone is defined, the second string should not be used. See note below. For the above Timezone constants ( , , , and ), the value is determined by the timezone rules in effect at module load time or the last time is called and may be incorrect for times in the past. It is recommended to use the and results from to obtain timezone information. More object-oriented interface to dates and times. Internationalization services.

        "document": "Hello everyone, hope you are learning python well. In this tutorial we will learn about python time sleep() method. Python sleep function belongs to the python time module that is already discussed earlier\n\nPython time sleep function is used to add delay in the execution of a program. We can use python sleep function to halt the execution of the program for given time in seconds. Notice that python time sleep function actually stops the execution of current thread only, not the whole program.\n\nPython sleep() is a method of python time module. So, first we have to import the time module then we can use this method. Way of using python sleep() function is: Here the argument of the sleep() method t is in seconds. That means, when the statement time.sleep(t) is executed then the next line of code will be executed after t seconds. See the following example:\n\nIf you run the above code then you will see that the second print executes after 5 seconds. So you can make delay in your code as necessary. The argument can be in floating value also to have more precise delay. For example you want to make delay for 100 milliseconds which is 0.1 seconds, as following:\n\nLet’s see the following example of python time sleep function.\n\nElapsed time is greater than 5 because each time in the for loop, execution is halted for 1 second. The extra time is because of the execution time of the program, operating system thread scheduling etc.\n\nSometimes you may need to delay for different seconds of time. You can do it as follows:\n\nYou may need to print some message in a dramatic way, you can do it as following:\n\nIf you run the above code then, you will see that after printing every character of the message it’s taking some time, which seems like dramatic.\n\nPython time sleep() function is very important method for multithreading. Below is a simple example showing that the python time sleep function halts the execution of current thread only in multithreaded programming.\n\nBelow image shows the output produced by above python thread sleep example. From the output it’s very clear that only the threads are being stopped from execution and not the whole program by python time sleep function. That’s all about python time sleep function or python sleep function. Reference: StackOverFlow Post, API Doc"

        "document": "Have you ever needed to make your Python program wait for something? Most of the time, you’d want your code to execute as quickly as possible. But there are times when letting your code sleep for a while is actually in your best interest.\n\nFor example, you might use a Python call to simulate a delay in your program. Perhaps you need to wait for a file to upload or download, or for a graphic to load or be drawn to the screen. You might even need to pause between calls to a web API, or between queries to a database. Adding Python calls to your program can help in each of these cases, and many more!\n\nIn this tutorial, you’ll learn how to add Python calls with:\n\nThis article is intended for intermediate developers who are looking to grow their knowledge of Python. If that sounds like you, then let’s get started!\n\nPython has built-in support for putting your program to sleep. The module has a function that you can use to suspend execution of the calling thread for however many seconds you specify. Here’s an example of how to use : If you run this code in your console, then you should experience a delay before you can enter a new statement in the REPL. Note: In Python 3.5, the core developers changed the behavior of slightly. The new Python system call will last at least the number of seconds you’ve specified, even if the sleep is interrupted by a signal. This does not apply if the signal itself raises an exception, however. You can test how long the sleep lasts by using Python’s module: python3 -m timeit -n 3 loops, best of 5: 3 sec per loop Here, you run the module with the parameter, which tells how many times to run the statement that follows. You can see that ran the statement 3 times and that the best run time was 3 seconds, which is what was expected. The default number of times that will run your code is one million. If you were to run the above code with the default , then at 3 seconds per iteration, your terminal would hang for approximately 34 days! The module has several other command line options that you can check out in its documentation. Let’s create something a bit more realistic. A system administrator needs to know when one of their websites goes down. You want to be able to check the website’s status code regularly, but you can’t query the web server constantly or it will affect performance. One way to do this check is to use a Python system call: Here you create , which takes a URL as its argument. The function then attempts to open that URL with . If there’s an or , then the program catches it and prints out the error. (In a live environment, you would log the error and probably send out an email to the webmaster or system administrator.) If no errors occur, then your code prints out that all is well. Regardless of what happens, your program will sleep for 60 seconds. This means that you only access the website once every minute. The URL used in this example is bad, so it will output the following to your console once every minute: Go ahead and update the code to use a known good URL, like . Then you can re-run it to see it work successfully. You can also try to update the code to send an email or log the errors. For more information on how to do this, check out Sending Emails With Python and Logging in Python.\n\nThere are times when you need to retry a function that has failed. One popular use case for this is when you need to retry a file download because the server was busy. You usually won’t want to make a request to the server too often, so adding a Python call between each request is desirable. Another use case that I’ve personally experienced is where I need to check the state of a user interface during an automated test. The user interface might load faster or slower than usual, depending on the computer I’m running the test on. This can change what’s on the screen at the moment my program is verifying something. In this case, I can tell the program to sleep for a moment and then recheck things a second or two later. This can mean the difference between a passing and failing test. You can use a decorator to add a Python system call in either of these cases. If you’re not familiar with decorators, or if you’d like to brush up on them, then check out Primer on Python Decorators. Let’s look at an example: is your decorator. It accepts a value and the number of times it should , which defaults to 3. Inside is another function, , which accepts the decorated function. Finally, the innermost function accepts the arguments and keyword arguments that you pass to the decorated function. This is where the magic happens! You use a loop to retry calling the function. If there’s an exception, then you call , increment the counter, and try running the function again. Now rewrite to use your new decorator: # Re-raise the exception for the decorator # Re-raise the exception for the decorator Here, you decorate with a of 3 seconds. You’ve also removed the original loop, as well as the old call to . The decorator now takes care of this. One other change you’ve made is to add a inside of the exception handling blocks. This is so that the decorator will work properly. You could write the decorator to handle these errors, but since these exceptions only apply to , you might be better off keeping the decorator the way it is. That way, it will work with a wider variety of functions. Note: If you’d like to brush up on exception handling in Python, then check out Python Exceptions: An Introduction. There are a few improvements that you could make to your decorator. If it runs out of retries and still fails, then you could have it re-raise the last error. The decorator will also wait 3 seconds after the last failure, which might be something you don’t want to happen. Feel free to try these out as an exercise!\n\nThere are also times when you might want to add a Python call to a thread. Perhaps you’re running a migration script against a database with millions of records in production. You don’t want to cause any downtime, but you also don’t want to wait longer than necessary to finish the migration, so you decide to use threads. Note: Threads are a method of doing concurrency in Python. You can run multiple threads at once to increase your application’s throughput. If you’re not familiar with threads in Python, then check out An Intro to Threading in Python. To prevent customers from noticing any kind of slowdown, each thread needs to run for a short period and then sleep. There are two ways to do this:\n• Use as before.\n• Use from the module. Let’s start by looking at . The Python Logging Cookbook shows a nice example that uses . Python’s module is thread-safe, so it’s a bit more useful than statements for this exercise. The following code is based on this example: Here, you use Python’s module to create two threads. You also create a logging object that will log the to stdout. Next, you start both threads and initiate a loop to log from the main thread every so often. You use to catch the user pressing + . Try running the code above in your terminal. You should see output similar to the following: As each thread runs and then sleeps, the logging output is printed to the console. Now that you’ve tried an example, you’ll be able to use these concepts in your own code. The module provides an that you can use like . However, has the added benefit of being more responsive. The reason for this is that when the event is set, the program will break out of the loop immediately. With , your code will need to wait for the Python call to finish before the thread can exit. The reason you’d want to use here is because is non-blocking, whereas is blocking. What this means is that when you use , you’ll block the main thread from continuing to run while it waits for the call to end. solves this problem. You can read more about how all this works in Python’s threading documentation. Here’s how you add a Python call with : In this example, you create and pass it to . (Recall that in the previous example, you instead passed a dictionary.) Next, you set up your loops to check whether or not is set. If it’s not, then your code prints a message and waits a bit before checking again. To set the event, you can press + . Once the event is set, will return and the loop will break, ending the program. Note: If you’d like to learn more about dictionaries, then check out Dictionaries in Python. Take a closer look at the code block above. How would you pass in a different sleep time to each worker thread? Can you figure it out? Feel free to tackle this exercise on your own!\n\nAsynchronous capabilities were added to Python in the 3.4 release, and this feature set has been aggressively expanding ever since. Asynchronous programming is a type of parallel programming that allows you to run multiple tasks at once. When a task finishes, it will notify the main thread. is a module that lets you add a Python call asynchronously. If you’re unfamiliar with Python’s implementation of asynchronous programming, then check out Async IO in Python: A Complete Walkthrough and Python Concurrency & Parallel Programming. Here’s an example from Python’s own documentation: In this example, you run and have it sleep for one second between two calls. Here’s a more compelling example from the Coroutines and Tasks portion of the documentation: In this code, you create a worker called that takes in the number of seconds to and the to print out. Then, you use Python’s keyword to wait for the code to run. is required here because has been marked as an function, so you can’t call it like you would a normal function. When you run this code, your program will execute 3 times. The code will wait for 1, 2, and 3 seconds, for a total wait time of 6 seconds. You can also rewrite the code so that the tasks run in parallel: Now you’re using the concept of tasks, which you can make with . When you use tasks in , Python will run the tasks asynchronously. So, when you run the code above, it should finish in 3 seconds total instead of 6.\n\nCommand-line applications aren’t the only place where you might need to add Python calls. When you create a Graphical User Interface (GUI), you’ll occasionally need to add delays. For example, you might create an FTP application to download millions of files, but you need to add a call between batches so you don’t bog down the server. GUI code will run all its processing and drawing in a main thread called the event loop. If you use inside of GUI code, then you’ll block its event loop. From the user’s perspective, the application could appear to freeze. The user won’t be able to interact with your application while it’s sleeping with this method. (On Windows, you might even get an alert about how your application is now unresponsive.) Fortunately, there are other methods you can use besides . In the next few sections, you’ll learn how to add Python calls in both Tkinter and wxPython. is a part of the Python standard library. It may not be available to you if you’re using a pre-installed version of Python on Linux or Mac. If you get an , then you’ll need to look into how to add it to your system. But if you install Python yourself, then should already be available. You’ll start by looking at an example that uses . Run this code to see what happens when you add a Python call the wrong way: Once you’ve run the code, press the button in your GUI. The button will stick down for three seconds as it waits for to finish. If the application had other buttons, then you wouldn’t be able to click them. You can’t close the application while it’s sleeping, either, since it can’t respond to the close event. To get to sleep properly, you’ll need to use : Here you create an application that is 400 pixels wide by 400 pixels tall. It has no widgets on it. All it will do is show a frame. Then, you call where is a reference to the object. takes two arguments:\n• The number of milliseconds to sleep\n• The method to call when the sleep is finished In this case, your application will print a string to stdout after 3 seconds. You can think of as the version of , but it also adds the ability to call a function after the sleep has finished. You could use this functionality to improve user experience. By adding a Python call, you can make the application appear to load faster and then start some longer-running process after it’s up. That way, the user won’t have to wait for the application to open. There are two major differences between wxPython and Tkinter:\n• wxPython has many more widgets.\n• wxPython aims to look and feel native on all platforms. The wxPython framework is not included with Python, so you’ll need to install it yourself. If you’re not familiar with wxPython, then check out How to Build a Python GUI Application With wxPython. In wxPython, you can use to add a Python call: Here, you subclass directly and then call . This function takes the same parameters as Tkinter’s :\n• The number of milliseconds to sleep\n• The method to call when the sleep is finished When you run this code, you should see a small blank window appear without any widgets. After 4 seconds, you’ll see the string printed to stdout. One of the benefits of using is that it’s thread-safe. You can use this method from within a thread to call a function that’s in the main wxPython application."

        "document": "Python’s loop enables you to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a given condition remains true. Unlike loops, which iterate a known number of times, loops are ideal for situations where the number of iterations isn’t known upfront.\n\nLoops are a pretty useful construct in Python, so learning how to write and use them is a great skill for you as a Python developer.\n\nBy the end of this tutorial, you’ll understand that:\n• is a Python keyword used to initiate a loop that repeats a block of code as long as a condition is true.\n• A loop works by evaluating a condition at the start of each iteration. If the condition is true, then the loop executes. Otherwise, it terminates.\n• loops are useful when the number of iterations is unknown, such as waiting for a condition to change or continuously processing user input.\n• in Python creates an infinite loop that continues until a statement or external interruption occurs.\n• Python lacks a built-in do-while loop, but you can emulate it using a loop with a statement for conditional termination.\n\nWith this knowledge, you’re prepared to write effective loops in your Python programs, handling a wide range of iteration needs.\n\nIn programming, loops are control flow statements that allow you to repeat a given set of operations a number of times. In practice, you’ll find two main types of loops:\n• loops are mostly used to iterate a known number of times, which is common when you’re processing data collections with a specific number of data items.\n• loops are commonly used to iterate an unknown number of times, which is useful when the number of iterations depends on a given condition. Python has both of these loops and in this tutorial, you’ll learn about loops. In Python, you’ll generally use loops when you need to repeat a series of tasks an unknown number of times. Python loops are compound statements with a header and a code block that runs until a given condition becomes false. The basic syntax of a loop is shown below: In this syntax, is an expression that the loop evaluates for its truth value. If the condition is true, then the loop body runs. Otherwise, the loop terminates. Note that the loop body can consist of one or more statements that must be indented properly. Here’s a more detailed breakdown of this syntax:\n• is the keyword that initiates the loop header.\n• is an expression evaluated for truthiness that defines the exit condition.\n• consists of one or more statements to execute in each iteration. Here’s a quick example of how you can use a loop to iterate over a decreasing sequence of numbers: In this example, is the loop condition. If this condition returns a false value, the loop terminates. The body consists of a call to that displays the value on the screen. Next, you decrease the value of . This change will produce a different result when the loop evaluates the condition in the next iteration. The loop runs while the condition remains true. When the condition turns false, the loop terminates, and the program execution proceeds to the first statement after the loop body. In this example, the loop terminates when reaches a value less than or equal to . If the loop condition doesn’t become false, then you have a potentially infinite loop. Consider the following loop, and keep your fingers near the + key combination to terminate its execution: In this example, the loop condition is . This condition works when you decrease by . However, if you decrease it by 2, the condition may never become false, resulting in a potentially infinite loop. In such cases, you can usually terminate the loop by pressing + , which raises a exception on most operating systems. Note that the loop checks its condition first before anything else happens. If it’s false to start with, then the loop body will never run: In this example, when the loop finds that isn’t greater than , it immediately terminates the execution without entering the loop body. So, the body never executes. Now that you know the basic syntax of loops, it’s time to dive into some practical examples in Python. In the next section, you’ll see how these loops can be applied to real-world scenarios.\n\nThe Python loop has some advanced features that make it flexible and powerful. These features can be helpful when you need to fine-tune the loop to meet specific execution flows. So far, you’ve seen examples where the entire loop body runs on each iteration. Python provides two keywords that let you modify that behavior:\n• : Immediately terminates a loop. The program execution then proceeds with the first statement following the loop body.\n• : Ends only the current iteration. The execution jumps back to the loop header, and the loop condition is evaluated to determine whether the loop will execute again. Python’s loops also have additional syntax. They have an clause that runs when the loop terminates naturally because the condition becomes true. In the following sections, you’ll learn more about how the and statements work, as well as how to use the clause effectively in loops. With the statement, you can terminate the execution of a loop and make your program continue with the first statement immediately after the loop body. Here’s a short script that demonstrates how the statement works: When becomes , the statement is reached, and the loop terminates completely. The program execution jumps to the call to in the final line of the script. Running from the command line produces the following output: The loop prints values normally. When reaches the value of , then runs, terminating the loop and printing to your screen. Note that and aren’t printed at all. It’s important to note that it makes little sense to have statements outside of conditionals. Suppose you include a statement directly in the loop body without wrapping it in a conditional. In that case, the loop will terminate in the first iteration, potentially without running the entire loop body. The Statement: Skipping Tasks in an Iteration Next, you have the statement. With this statement, you can skip some tasks in the current iteration when a given condition is met. The next script is almost identical to the one in the previous section except for the statement in place of : The output of looks like this: This time, when is , the statement terminates that iteration. That’s why isn’t printed. The control then returns to the loop header, where the condition is re-evaluated. The loop continues until reaches , at which point it terminates as before. Python allows an optional clause at the end of loops. The syntax is shown below: The code under the clause will run only if the loop terminates naturally without encountering a statement. In other words, it executes when the loop condition becomes false, and only then. Note that it doesn’t make much sense to have an clause in a loop that doesn’t have a statement. In that case, placing the block’s content after the loop—without indentation—will work the same and be cleaner. When might an clause on a loop be useful? One common use case for is when you need to break out of the loop. Consider the following example: This script simulates the process of connecting to an external server. The loop lets you try to connect a number of times, defined by the constant. If the connection is successful, then the statement terminates the loop. Note: In the example above, you used the module to simulate a successful or unsuccessful connection. You’ll use this module in a few other examples throughout this tutorial. To learn more about random data, check out the Generating Random Data in Python (Guide) tutorial. When all the connection attempts fail, the clause executes, letting you know that the attempts were unsuccessful. Go ahead and run the script several times to check the results.\n\nWhen writing loops in Python, you should ensure that they’re efficient and readable. You also need to make sure that they terminate correctly. Normally, you choose to use a loop when you need to repeat a series of actions until a given condition becomes false or while it remains true. This type of loop isn’t the way to go when you need to process all the items in an iterable. In that case, you should use a loop instead. In the following sections, you’ll learn how to use loops effectively, avoid infinite loops, implement control statements like and , and leverage the clause for handling loop completion gracefully. A general use case for a loop is waiting for a resource to become available before proceeding to use it. This is common in scenarios like the following:\n• Waiting for a file to be created or populated Here’s a loop that continually checks if a given file has been created: \"File not found. Retrying in 1 second...\" The loop in this script uses the method on a object. This method returns if the target file exits. The operator negates the check result, returning if the file doesn’t exit. If that’s the case, then the loop waits for one second to run another iteration and check for the file again. If you run this script, then you’ll get something like the following: python check_file.py Waiting for hello.txt to be created... File not found. Retrying in 1 second... File not found. Retrying in 1 second... File not found. Retrying in 1 second... In the meantime, you can open another terminal and create the file. When the loop finds the newly created file, it’ll terminate. Then, the code after the loop will run, printing the file content to your screen. Using Loops for an Unknown Number of Iterations loops are also great when you need to process a stream of data with an unknown number of items. In this scenario, you don’t know the required number of iterations, so you can use a loop with as its control condition. This technique provides a Pythonic way to write loops that will run an unknown number of iterations. To illustrate, suppose you need to read a temperature sensor that continuously provides data. When the temperature is equal to or greater than 28 degrees Celsius, you should stop monitoring it. Here’s a loop to accomplish this task: In this loop, you use as the loop condition, which generates a continually running loop. Then, you read the temperature sensor and print the current temperature value. If the temperature is equal to or greater than 25 degrees, you break out of the loop. Otherwise, you wait for a second and read the sensor again. Removing Items From an Iterable in a Loop Modifying a collection during iteration can be risky, especially when you need to remove items from the target collection. In some cases, using a loop can be a good solution. For example, say that you need to process a list of values and remove each value after it’s processed. In this situation, you can use a loop like the following: When you evaluate a list in a Boolean context, you get if it contains elements and if it’s empty. In this example, remains true as long as it has elements. Once you remove all the items with the method, becomes false, and the loop terminates. Getting user input from the command line is a common use case for loops in Python. Consider the following loop that takes input using the built-in functions. The loop runs until you type the word : The function asks the user to enter some text. Then, you assign the result to the variable. The loop condition checks whether the content of is different from , in which case, the loop body executes. Inside the loop, you call again. The loop repeats until the user types the word . This example works, but it has the drawback of unnecessarily repeating the call to . You can avoid the repetition using the walrus operator as in the code snippet below: In this updated loop, you get the user input in the variable using an assignment expression. At the same time, the expression returns the user input so that it can be compared to the sentinel value . Using a loop with the built-in function may be a great way to fine-control the iteration process when working with iterators and iterables. To give you an idea of how this works, you’ll rewrite a loop using a loop instead. Consider the following code: The two loops are equivalent. When you run the script, each loop will handle the three requests in turn: Python’s loops are quite flexible and powerful, and you should generally prefer over if you need to iterate over a given collection. However, translating the loop into a loop, like above, gives you even more flexibility in how you handle the iterator. A do-while loop is a control flow statement that executes its code block at least once, regardless of whether the loop condition is true or false. If you come from languages like C, C++, Java, or JavaScript, then you may be wondering where Python’s do-while loop is. The bad news is that Python doesn’t have one. The good news is that you can emulate it using a loop with a statement. Consider the following example, which takes user input in a loop: Again, this loop takes the user input using the built-in function. The input is then converted into an integer number using . If the user enters a number that’s or lower, then the statement runs, and the loop terminates. Note that to emulate a do-while loop in Python, the condition that terminates the loop goes at the end of the loop, and its body is a statement. It’s also important to emphasize that in this type of loop, the body runs at least once.\n\nSometimes, you might write a loop that doesn’t naturally terminate. A loop with this behavior is commonly known as an infinite loop, although the name isn’t quite accurate because, in the end, you’ll have to terminate the loop somehow. You may write an infinite loop either intentionally or unintentionally. Intentional infinite loops are powerful tools commonly used in programs that need to run continuously until an external condition is met, such as game loops, server processes, and event-driven apps like GUI apps or asynchronous code. In contrast, unintentional infinite loops are often the result of some kind of logical issue that prevents the loop condition from ever becoming false. For example, this can happen when the loop: In these cases, the loop erroneously continues to run until it’s terminated externally. In the following sections, you’ll learn about both types of infinite loops and how to approach them in your code. To kick things off, you’ll start with unintentional infinite loops. Suppose you write a loop that never ends due to an internal error. Getting back to the example in the initial section of this tutorial, you have the following loop that runs continuously: To terminate this code, you have to press + , which interrupts the program’s execution from the keyboard. Otherwise, the loop would run indefinitely since its condition never turns false. In real-world code, you’d typically want to have a proper loop condition to prevent unintended infinite execution. In most cases like this, you can prevent the potentially infinite loop by fixing the condition itself or the internal loop logic to make sure the condition becomes false at some point in the loop’s execution. In the example above, you can modify the condition a bit to fix the issue: This time, the loop doesn’t go down the value. Instead, it terminates when has a value that’s equal to or less than . Alternatively, you can use additional conditionals in the loop body to terminate the loop using : This loop has the same original loop condition. However, it includes a failsafe condition in the loop body to terminate it in case the main condition fails. Figuring out how to fix an unintentional infinite loop will largely depend on the logic you’re using in the loop condition and body. So, you should analyze each case carefully to determine the correct solution. Intentionally infinite loops are pretty common and useful. However, writing them correctly requires ensuring proper exit conditions, avoiding performance issues, and preventing unintended infinite execution. For example, you might want to write code for a service that starts up and runs forever, accepting service requests. Forever, in this context, means until you shut it down. The typical way to write an infinite loop is to use the construct. To ensure that the loop terminates naturally, you should add one or more statements wrapped in proper conditions: This syntax works well when you have multiple reasons to end the loop. It’s often cleaner to break out from several different locations rather than try to specify all the termination conditions in the loop header. To see this construct in practice, consider the following infinite loop that asks the user to provide their password: This loop has two exit conditions. The first condition checks whether the password is correct. The second condition checks whether the user has reached the maximum number of attempts to provide a correct password. Both conditions include a statement to finish the loop gracefully."

Other times a loop is obviously infinite because it has no iteration variable at all.\n\nSometimes you don’t know it’s time to end a loop until you get half way through the body. In that case you can write an infinite loop on purpose and then use the statement to jump out of the loop.\n\nThis loop is obviously an infinite loop because the logical expression on the statement is simply the logical constant :\n\nAs you can see above, the Code Lens gives you a warning because it runs for over 1000 steps. If you make the mistake of running this code, you will learn quickly how to stop a runaway Python process on your system or find where the power-off button is on your computer.

        "document": "An infinite loop in Python occurs when a loop continues to execute indefinitely because its termination condition is never met, often due to a missing or incorrect exit condition.\n\nInfinite loops are a fundamental concept in programming, and Python is no exception. An infinite loop occurs when a sequence of instructions continues to execute endlessly without a defined endpoint, often due to the loop's condition being perpetually met. While this might sound problematic, infinite loops can be incredibly useful in various scenarios, such as handling real-time data, creating interactive applications, and maintaining ongoing processes.\n\nUnderstanding how to effectively create, manage, and exit infinite loops is crucial for any Python developer. In this article, we will explore the mechanics of infinite loops, their practical applications and different types, and the best practices for avoiding common pitfalls associated with them.\n\nAn infinite loop in Python programming language is a sequence that continues indefinitely until it is externally stopped. This type of loop does not have a terminating condition. It often uses conditions that are always true, which causes the loop to never end. In Python, infinite loops can be intentional or unintentional. Developers may create them for specific tasks. However, they can also occur by mistake when a condition is incorrectly set.\n\nA real-world example of an infinite loop can be found in the context of a simple command-line-based chatbot. In this scenario, the chatbot continuously interacts with users, responding to their inputs until the user decides to end the conversation.\n\nHow To Write An Infinite Loop In Python\n\nIn Python, you can create an infinite loop using a while loop with the condition set to True. Here's the process:\n• Define the Loop Structure: An infinite while loop is a common way to create an endless loop in Python.\n• Initiate the Loop: Use the while True: statement to start it. This means the loop will run indefinitely until a break condition is met.\n• Set Up Loop Conditions: You can include control statements like break or continue. For example, if a user input matches a specific value, you can use break to exit the loop.\n• Testing and Debugging: Testing and debugging are crucial. Use print statements to monitor variables inside the loop. This helps ensure that the infinite iteration behaves as expected.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively create and manage infinite loops in Python.\n\nWhen Are Infinite Loops In Python Necessary?\n\nPython infinite loops are necessary or useful in several scenarios, particularly when you need to continuously perform an action without knowing ahead of time when the loop should stop. Here are some common situations:\n• Event-Driven Programs: Servers and GUI programs often rely on infinite loops to keep the system responsive, continuously waiting for events (e.g., a button click, incoming data, etc.). The loop runs until an external condition causes it to stop. For Example: A web server continuously listens for incoming requests.\n• Monitoring and Polling: Infinite loops can be used to monitor a condition or poll a resource at regular intervals. For instance, checking the status of a system or service. For Example: Monitoring a file or process.\n• Game Loops: Many games have a main loop that keeps running until the game ends. This loop continuously updates the game state, processes input, and renders graphics. For Example: A basic game loop.\n• Real-Time Systems: Systems that require real-time processing (e.g., embedded systems or IoT devices) often use infinite loops to handle continuous input or perform actions in real time.\n• Daemon/Background Services: Many background processes or services run indefinitely until explicitly stopped, such as a logging service that collects logs from various sources.\n• User Input until Exit Condition: If you're waiting for user input indefinitely (e.g., a command-line tool that keeps accepting commands until the user types \"exit\"), an infinite loop is often employed.\n\nThe infinite loops in Python can be categorized into different types based on the intent behind their design: fake infinite loops, intended infinite loops, and unintended infinite loops. Each type serves a unique purpose or may result from logical errors in the code.\n\nFake infinite loops appear to run forever. However, they contain a hidden termination condition. These loops are often used in testing environments. They simulate long-running processes without actual risks.\n• For example, a developer can create a fake loop to mimic a server running indefinitely. This helps test how other parts of the system react under load.\n• Fake infinite loops allow developers to observe behavior without crashing the program. They provide a safe space for experimentation.\n• By using them, developers can ensure their code handles unexpected situations well. This method of testing is crucial for building reliable software.\n\nIn the above code example-\n• We start by initializing a variable counter to 0.\n• Next, we enter an infinite while loop using while True, which keeps running until we explicitly stop it.\n• Inside the loop, we print the current value of counter using an f-string to format the output.\n• After printing, we increment the counter by 1 with counter += 1.\n• We then check if counter has reached 5. If it has, we print \"Exiting loop\" to signal that we're about to stop the loop.\n• Finally, the break statement ends the loop, stopping further execution.\n\nIntended infinite loops serve specific purposes. They are designed to run continuously until manually stopped. Many systems require this type of loop for constant operation.\n• For instance, IoT devices often use intended infinite loops to stay ready for user input or data collection.\n• These loops must have a clear exit strategy. Without one, they could lead to resource exhaustion or system crashes.\n• A common practice is to monitor conditions within the loop. If certain criteria are met, the loop can safely terminate. This approach ensures that the system remains responsive and efficient.\n\nIn the above code example-\n• We start an infinite loop using while True, which will continue running until we manually stop it.\n• Inside the loop, we prompt the user for input by defining a function input() and asking them to type \"exit\" to stop the loop.\n• The user's input is stored in the variable user_input.\n• We then check if user_input is equal to \"exit\".\n• If it is, we print \"Loop stopped.\" to inform the user that the loop is ending.\n• Finally, the break statement is used to exit the loop, stopping its execution.\n\nUnintended infinite loops occur due to logical errors in the code. These mistakes can stem from missing or incorrect loop control statements.\n• For example, if a loop condition never becomes false, it will run forever.\n• The impact of unintended infinite loops can be severe. They may cause programs to freeze or crash. This situation leads to frustrating experiences for users and developers alike.\n• To prevent these issues, thorough code reviews and testing are essential. Developers should carefully examine their logic before finalizing their code.\n\nIn the above code example-\n• First, we initialize the variable counter to 0.\n• We enter a while loop with the condition counter < 5, meaning the loop will run as long as counter is less than 5.\n• Inside the loop, we print the current value of counter using an f-string.\n• However, we forgot to increment the counter, so it stays at 0, causing the condition counter < 5 to always be true.\n• As a result, the loop continues indefinitely because the counter never changes.\n\nHere's how different control statements like for, while, if, break, and continue interact with Python infinite loops:\n\nA while loop is commonly used to create an infinite loop by setting its condition to True. The loop will continue running until it encounters a break statement or an external stop.\n\nIn the above code example-\n• We start an infinite loop using while True, which is designed to run continuously.\n• Inside the while loop, we print the message \"This loop will run forever!\" to indicate that the loop is active.\n• Immediately after printing, we use the break statement to exit the loop.\n• This means the loop will only run for one iteration before stopping, so even though it was set to run forever, it effectively ends after displaying the message once.\n\nThe for loops aren't typically used for infinite loops, but they can be made infinite by looping over an endlessly repeating generator or sequence, like itertools.cycle.\n\nIn the above code example-\n• We begin by importing the itertools module, which provides various functions that work on iterators.\n• We use itertools.cycle([1]), which creates an iterator that will cycle through the list [1] infinitely.\n• We then set up a for loop that iterates over this infinite iterator, but we use _ as the loop variable since we don't need to use its value.\n• Inside the loop, we print the message \"Infinite loop with for!\" to indicate that the loop is executing.\n• Immediately after printing, we include a break statement to exit the loop.\n• This results in the loop running only once, even though it was set up to cycle infinitely, as it stops right after displaying the message.\n\nIntegrating if statements within a while loop provides more control over execution. The if conditions inside infinite loops are useful for checking conditions dynamically and deciding whether to break or continue the loop.\n\nIn the above code example-\n• We start by initializing a variable counter to 0.\n• We then enter an infinite loop using while True, which will run until we explicitly stop it.\n• Inside the loop, we increment the counter by 1 with counter += 1.\n• We then print the current value of counter using an f-string.\n• Next, we check if counter has reached 3 using an if-statement. If it has, we print the message \"Breaking the loop\" to indicate that we're about to stop the loop.\n• Finally, we use the break statement to exit the loop when counter equals 3, ending the loop's execution.\n\nThe break statement serves a crucial role in managing loops. It allows for premature termination of a loop when certain conditions are met. In infinite loops, break is essential to stopping the loop when a certain condition is met.\n\nIn the above code example-\n• We start an infinite loop using while True, which will continue running until we manually stop it.\n• Inside the loop, we prompt the user for input with input() function, asking them to type \"stop\" to break the loop.\n• We store the user's input in the variable user_input.\n• We then check if user_input is equal to \"stop\".\n• If it is, we print the message \"Loop stopped.\" to inform the user that the loop is ending.\n• Finally, we use the break statement to exit the loop, stopping its execution when the user types \"stop\".\n\nThe continue statement helps refine loop logic by skipping the current iteration without stopping the entire loop. When executed, it jumps back to the beginning of the loop for the next cycle. In an infinite loop, it can be used to bypass certain code when specific conditions are met.\n\nIn the above code example-\n• We start by initializing a variable counter to 0.\n• Next, we enter an infinite loop using while True, which will run continuously until we stop it explicitly.\n• Inside the loop, we increment the counter by 1 with counter += 1.\n• We then check if counter is even by using the condition counter % 2 == 0. If this condition is true, we use the continue statement to skip the rest of the loop for that iteration.\n• If counter is odd, we print the current value as \"Odd Counter: {counter}\".\n• We then check if counter has reached 5. If it has, we use the break statement to exit the loop.\n• As a result, the loop will only print odd values of counter (1, 3, 5) and will stop when counter equals 5.\n\nPython infinite loops and finite loops differ in structure and application. A finite loop runs a specific number of times. An infinite loop, on the other hand, continues until an external factor stops it. Here's a table highlighting the key differences between finite loops and infinite loops in Python:\n\nAvoiding infinite loops in Python is crucial for ensuring your programs run efficiently and do not become unresponsive. Here are several strategies to prevent infinite loops:\n• Set Clear Exit Conditions: Always ensure that your loop has a clear and achievable exit condition. For example, when using a while loop, make sure the condition will eventually evaluate to False.\n• Use Loop Counters: If your loop is meant to run a specific number of times, use a counter to track iterations and break the loop when the counter reaches a defined limit.\n• Implement break Statements: Use break statements to exit loops based on certain conditions being met. This is especially useful in while loops.\n• Validate User Input: When using loops that depend on user input, validate the input to ensure it can lead to an exit condition. Avoid relying solely on user input that might not be controlled.\n• Set a Maximum Iteration Limit: You can implement a maximum iteration limit in your loops, especially in cases where conditions might not be guaranteed to change.\n• Use Debugging Techniques: Utilize debugging tools or print statements to monitor variable states within your loops. This can help identify if your loop is behaving as expected.\n• Employ Unit Testing: Write unit tests for your functions that involve loops to ensure that they behave correctly under various conditions, preventing infinite loops from sneaking into your code.\n• Review and Refactor Code: Regularly review and refactor your code to identify potential infinite loops, especially after making changes. Peer reviews can also be beneficial for catching logical errors.\n\nBy applying these strategies, you can significantly reduce the chances of encountering infinite loops in your Python programs, leading to more robust and reliable code.\n\nPython infinite loops are powerful constructs that can serve various purposes, from creating responsive applications to managing continuous processes. While they offer flexibility and control, it’s essential to use them with caution to avoid unintended consequences such as unresponsive programs and excessive resource consumption. By understanding how to create, manage, and exit infinite loops effectively, developers can leverage their capabilities in scenarios like event-driven programming and real-time systems.\n\nAdditionally, implementing strategies to prevent infinite loops—such as setting clear exit conditions and validating user input—can lead to more robust and efficient code. As with any programming concept, the key to harnessing the power of infinite loops lies in careful planning, testing, and debugging.\n\nQ. What is an infinite loop in Python?\n\nAn infinite loop in Python is a loop that continues to execute indefinitely without terminating. It occurs when the loop's exit condition is never met or when the loop is explicitly designed to run forever (e.g., using while True:). These loops can be intentional, such as for server processes, or unintentional due to logic errors.\n\nQ. How can I create an infinite loop in Python?\n\nYou can create an infinite loop in Python using a while loop with the condition set to True. For example:\n\nAlternatively, you can use a for loop with an infinitely repeating generator, such as itertools.cycle, although it's less common.\n\nQ. When are infinite loops useful?\n\nInfinite loops are useful in several scenarios, including:\n• Event-driven programming: Waiting for user actions, such as in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) or servers that handle incoming requests.\n• Monitoring systems: Continuously checking the status of a service or resource until a certain condition is met.\n• Game loops: Running the main logic of a game, updating the state, and rendering graphics.\n\nQ. How do I exit an infinite loop?\n\nYou can exit an infinite loop using the break statement. This allows you to terminate the loop based on a specific condition. For example:\n\nAdditionally, you can interrupt the program externally (e.g., by pressing Ctrl + C in the terminal) to stop an infinite loop.\n\nQ. What are the risks of using infinite loops?\n\nThe risks of using infinite loops include:\n• Resource exhaustion: They can consume CPU cycles and memory, leading to unresponsive applications or system crashes.\n• Unintended behavior: Logic errors can result in loops that run longer than expected or indefinitely without a way to exit.\n• Difficult debugging: Finding the source of an unintended infinite loop can be challenging, especially in complex codebases.\n\nQ. Can you provide a practical example of an infinite loop?\n\nGiven below is a basic infinite loop examples that asks the user for input until they choose to exit:\n\nIn this example, the loop continues to prompt the user for input until they type 'quit', at which point the break statement is triggered, exiting the loop. This kind of infinite loop is commonly used in command-line applications and interactive scripts.\n\nWith this, we conclude our discussion on Python infinite loops.
