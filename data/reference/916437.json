Your organization’s database management system (DBMS) stores all the enterprise data you need for software applications, systems, and IT environments, helping you make smarter data-driven business decisions.\n\nHere are the key things to know about database schema design:\n• None Database schema design refers to the strategies and practices for constructing a database schema.\n• None A database schema is a description of how data is structured or organized in a database.\n• None There are six types of database schemas: flat model, hierarchical model, network model, relational model, star schema, and snowflake schema.\n• None The right database schema design helps you make better use of your enterprise data.\n\nNot all databases are equal. The design of a database schema influences how efficiently your database runs and how quickly you can retrieve information. However, designing a database schema is easier said than done. This article offers an overview of how database schema design works, as well as examples and best practices to help you optimize database schema design.\n\nSimply put, a database schema is a formal description of the structure or organization of a particular database (DB). The term database schema is most commonly used for relational databases, which organize information in tables and use the SQL query language. Non-relational (or “NoSQL”) databases come in several different formats and don't have a “schema” in the same way that relational databases do (although they do have an underlying structure).\n\nThere are two fundamental components of any database schema:\n• The physical database schema describes how you physically store data in a storage system and the form of storage used (files, key-value pairs, indices, etc.).\n• The logical database schema describes the logical constraints applied to data and defines fields, tables, relations, views, integrity constraints, etc. These requirements provide useful information for programmers to apply to the physical design of a database. The rules or constraints defined in this logical model determine how data in different tables relate to one another.\n\nThe definition of physical tables in the schema comes from the logical data model. Entities become tables, entity attributes become table fields, etc.\n\nLearn more about the six most common database schema types below:\n• A flat model database schema organizes data in a single, two-dimensional display—think of a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet or a . This schema is best for simple tables and databases without complex relationships between different entities.\n• Database schemas in a hierarchical model have a “tree-like” structure, with child nodes branching out from a root data node. This schema is ideal for storing nested data—for example, family trees or biological taxonomies.\n• The network model, like the hierarchical model, treats data as nodes connected to one other; however, it allows for more complex connections, such as and cycles. This schema can model the movement of goods and materials between locations or the workflows required to accomplish a particular task.\n• As discussed above, this model organizes data in a series of tables, rows, and columns, creating relationships between different entities. The next section and the rest of this guide will focus on the relational model.\n• The star schema is an evolution of the relational model that organizes data into facts and dimensions. Fact data is numerical (for example, the number of sales of a product), while dimensional data is descriptive (for example, a product’s price, color, weight, etc.).\n• is a further abstraction on top of the star schema. It contains a fact table that connects to a dimensional table , expanding the descriptiveness possible within a database. As you might have guessed, the snowflake schema gets its name from the intricate patterns of a snowflake, where smaller structures radiate off of the central arms of the flake.\n\nRelated Reading: 6 Database Schema Designs and How to Use Them\n\nDatabase schema design — sometimes called SQL schema design — refers to the practices and strategies for constructing a database schema. You can think of database schema design as a blueprint for storing massive amounts of information in a database. The schema is an abstract structure or outline representing the logical view of the database as a whole. Defining data types and the relationships between them, database schema design makes data much easier to retrieve, consume, manipulate, and interpret.\n\nDB schema design organizes data into separate entities, determines how to create relationships between organized entities, and influences the applications of constraints on data. Designers create database schemas to give other database users, such as programmers and analysts, a logical understanding of data.\n\nInefficiently organized databases suck up tons of energy and resources and are difficult to maintain and administer. That’s where database schema design comes into play. You’ll struggle to get value from enterprise data without a clean, efficient, consistent database schema. The right schema design removes duplicated and inconsistent data in different locations.\n\nRelational database systems depend on a solid database schema. The goals of good schema design include:\n• None Keeping sensitive and confidential data secure and accessible to those who need it.\n\nDatabase schemas outline the architecture of a database and ensure database fundamentals such as the following:\n\nA DB schema design can exist both as a visual representation and as a set of formulas or use constraints that govern a database. Developers then express these formulas in different data definition languages, depending on the database system you use. The leading database systems define schemas slightly differently. However, MySQL, Oracle Database, and Microsoft SQL Server each support the CREATE SCHEMA statement.\n\nSuppose you want to create a database to hold information for your accounting department. A specific schema for this database might outline the structure of two simple tables:\n\nThis single schema contains valuable information such as:\n• None The title of each table\n• None The fields each table contains\n• None The relationships between tables (for example, linking an employee’s overtime pay to their identity via their ID number)\n\nDevelopers and database administrators can then convert these schema tables into SQL code.\n\nTo make the most of database schema design, it’s important to follow best practices. That ensures developers have a clear reference point for tables and fields in a project. Here are some of those best practices:\n• None Define and use appropriate naming conventions to make your database schema designs more effective. While you may decide on a particular style or adhere to an ISO standard, the most important thing is to be consistent in your name fields.\n• None Try not to use reserved words in table names, column names, fields, etc. that will likely deliver a syntax error.\n• None Don’t use hyphens, quotes, spaces, or special characters. They will either require additional work or not be valid.\n• None Use singular nouns, not plural nouns, for table names (for example, use StudentName instead of StudentNames). A table represents a collection, so there’s no need to make the title plural.\n• None Omit unnecessary verbiage for table names (for example, use Department instead of DepartmentList or TableDepartments)\n• starts with a good database schema design. Use encryption for sensitive data such as personally identifiable information (PII) and passwords. Don’t give administrator roles to each user; instead, request user authentication for database access.\n• None Database schemas are useful long after you've created them and will be viewed by many other people. So good documentation is essential. Document your database schema design with explicit instructions and write comment lines for scripts, triggers, and other commands.\n• None Normalization ensures independent entities and relationships are not grouped in the same table, reducing redundancy and improving integrity. Use normalization as necessary to optimize database performance. Both over-normalization and under-normalization can lead to problems.\n• None Understanding your data and the attributes of each element helps you build out the most effective schema design. A well-designed schema can enable your data to grow exponentially. As you keep expanding your data, analyze each field in relation to the others you are collecting in your schema.\n\nDesigning your database schema is just the first step in good data management. Well-designed schemas ensure that you can efficiently retrieve and analyze your data. However, you need a tool like Integrate.io to actually perform this retrieval and analysis.\n\nIntegrate.io is a powerful, feature-rich no-code data pipeline platform that builds data pipelines from databases and other sources to a centralized target repository in the cloud. With more than 100 pre-built connectors and integrations and a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface, it’s never been easier to integrate enterprise data.\n\nAre you in the market for a cutting-edge data pipeline tool?

It includes the definition of how data is organized in the database, with relational databases organizing information in tables and using SQL for queries. Non-relational databases, or \"NoSQL\" databases, also have structures but differ from relational databases in their organization.\n\nDatabase schema design is crucial for the efficient organization of databases. It helps in reducing or eliminating data redundancy, preventing data inconsistencies, ensuring data integrity, facilitating rapid data lookup and retrieval, and keeping sensitive data secure. A well-designed schema is vital for making the most of enterprise data and supporting data-driven business decisions.\n\nWhat are the Types of Database Schemas?\n\nThere are six common types of database schemas: flat model, hierarchical model, network model, relational model, star schema, and snowflake schema. Each type has its unique structure and is suited for different kinds of data organization and retrieval needs.\n\nDesigning a database schema involves organizing data into entities, creating relationships between these entities, and applying constraints. The process can be both a visual and a formulaic exercise, using data definition languages appropriate to the database system. Key considerations include ensuring consistent data formatting, unique primary keys for record entries, and the inclusion of essential data.\n\nWhat are Best Practices for Database Schema Design?\n\nBest practices for database schema design include using appropriate naming conventions, ensuring data security, thorough documentation, applying normalization judiciously, and having a deep understanding of the data and its attributes. Following these practices helps in creating a schema that is efficient, secure, and scalable, facilitating easier data management and retrieval."

        "document": "Keeping data safe and secure is a top priority for database designers and administrators. Learn how to design a database for security in this article.\n\nWhen designing a database, security should be one of the top aspects to be considered. Databases store sensitive and valuable information, making them an attractive target for malicious actors. Protecting the data and ensuring its integrity and confidentiality are some of the most critical aspects when designing and implementing a database. In this article, we will discuss database security best practices and how to implement them.\n\nThere are a lot of things to consider when implementing database security best practices; before we start reviewing them you can get a quick introduction in our article A Beginner’s Guide to Database Security.\n\nAuthentication refers to the process of verifying the identity of an individual or a system before granting access to a resource (such as a database). Implementing strong authentication mechanisms to validate the identity of users is a must when designing a database.\n\nAuthentication can be based on three primary factors:\n• Something the user knows (e.g., a password or PIN).\n• Something the user has (e.g., a physical token or a mobile device).\n• Something the user is (e.g., biometric data like fingerprints or facial recognition).\n\nYou may want to read my article How to Store Login Data in a Database; it not only describes the best ways to store passwords and PINs, it also explains two-factor authentication (2FA) and social authentication. (2FA combines two or more factors for increased security; social authentication is provided by trusted companies like Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn or other platforms like Google or Microsoft.) The article also discusses using secure authentication protocols like LDAP, OAuth, or OpenID Connect for enhanced security without storing authentication information in the database.\n\nEnforcing complex passwords, enabling multi-factor authentication, and limiting the number of failed login attempts strongly reduces the chance of non-authenticated users accessing the database. In our article Best Practices for Designing a User Authentication Module, this and other aspects (like how to design a password recovery mechanism) are covered in detail.\n\nOnce we’ve authenticated a user, we are sure that they are the person they claim to be. But not all users have the same permissions and privileges on a database. Implementing strong access control mechanisms is crucial for safeguarding your database. This involves granting appropriate permissions to users and limiting access to authorized individuals or applications. Utilize role-based access control (RBAC) to assign specific privileges based on user roles and responsibilities. Additionally, regularly review and update access permissions to prevent unauthorized access.\n\nThis mechanism simplifies granting the required permissions to multiple users by defining roles. Each role consists of a set of permissions, usually associated with a specific task or position. Roles can also (usually) be nested, so you can create roles, grant permissions to them, and then grant those roles to another role. Once you have defined your roles, you grant them to each user rather than granting the user individual permissions.\n\nAlmost all database engines support (and promote) this security model for DB user management, allowing you to create roles like database administrator, database developer, app developer, tester, etc.\n\nThis model is not only useful for organizing database users. An application may also benefit from a similar approach – defining application roles based on required activities, granting each role the appropriate permissions, and assigning roles to end users.\n\nData encryption is essential for protecting sensitive information stored in the database. Encryption is available on most database engines; this feature converts information into secret code that hides the information's true meaning. Utilize strong encryption algorithms and ensure that encryption keys are securely managed to prevent unauthorized access to encrypted data.\n\nLet’s see how to implement encryption at a general level; we will cover encrypting specific sensitive information in another section.\n\nThis technique involves encrypting data before storing it on disk and then decrypting it when it is read from disk into memory by the database instance. This ensures any user who gains access to the database files (without having the required encryption key) will not be able to understand the data stored on the files.\n\nThis method is usually called Transparent Data Encryption, since it is completely transparent to the database users. It can be enabled by a database administrator for all (recommended) or some of the files of the database – or even for one or some columns. Then encryption/decryption is automatically performed by the database each time it writes or reads from disk.\n\nThis encryption is also applied to backups (since they usually copy data from blocks in the database files). The database files are secured on the server where they reside, but the backups are also secure if someone gets access to them (e.g. if a carry disk containing a backup is lost or stolen).\n\nThis feature uses two levels of encryption:\n• A master key is created and stored outside the database, in a secure wallet or HSM\n• One encryption key is created to encrypt database files. This key is stored internally in the database and encrypted with the master key.\n\nWhen the instance is started, it uses the master key to decrypt the regular keys and then uses it to encrypt/decrypt data that is written/read from disk.\n\nIt is extremely important to ensure that only the database instance has access to the master key. It is also important to create a secure backup of it, since the regular encryption key is required; without it the database will become unusable.\n\nImplementing Encryption in Transit ensures that data is not sneaked by non-authorized users that may get access to the network (intranet or internet) while data is in transit from the database server to the end-user application/device.\n\nEnabling Data in Transit encryption is usually a very simple configuration task that does not require end-user intervention. It can be achieved by using TCPS protocol instead of TCP for communication; some databases (like Oracle) also allow native in-transit encryption. It is simpler to set up, with no additional cost or licenses. There’s also no need to install certificates, as explained in this blog post. Other database providers offer similar options that can ensure that data is not compromised while being in transit.\n\nNot all data stored in a database has the same value or may produce the same harm if it is stolen or accessed without permission. Each country and state may have specific laws and regulations about which particular pieces of information are considered sensitive; some of the best known are the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) under California data privacy laws, or the USA’s Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which describes how medical information must be stored and shared.\n\nWhen we talk about sensitive information, we usually refer to any of the following:\n• Medical/health records (an individual's past, present, or future physical or mental health data, including payment information related to medical care).\n• Personal data (e. gender, racial or ethnic origin, political affiliation, religious belief, genetic and biometric data, etc.).\n• Personal Identifiable Information, or PII (any information that may uniquely identify a person, like social security number, passport number, or driver's license number). While encryption secures data in the database, removing your PII from the internet is crucial for full protection.\n\nWe have already seen the usage of encryption to protect the entire database from unauthorized access; now we are going to discuss how to implement additional encryption to ensure that specific pieces of information stored in the database are not directly available for users without an additional decryption process.\n\nThis type of encryption is not performed in the database; it’s done on the client side. Sensitive data is stored encrypted on the database, but the key used to encrypt and decrypt data is not available for the database instance. This key is kept only by the authorized users. Users who do not possess the correct key to decrypt data will be able to query the database data, but they will obtain illegible information.\n\nThis way, data is not only protected from users who do not have access to the database (but do have access to the disks or servers). It is also protected from authenticated database users who do not have the required permissions to access those particular pieces of sensitive information.\n\nAlthough the database is not responsible for the encryption and decryption of the data, it is part of database design work to identify the columns that will actually require this encryption and ensure that they are created using the appropriate data type to store the encrypted values.\n\nAll Together Now\n\nColumn encryption can be implemented in conjunction with regular “at rest” and “in transit” encryption, as shown below:\n• Database instance encrypting or decrypting data written or read from the disk (green arrows), including the already encrypted (outside of DB) CardNumber column, using the “orange” database encryption key.\n• Database instance and clients encrypt and decrypt data that is transferred in the network (blue arrows), including the already encrypted (outside of DB) CardNumber column, using TCPS or native network encryption keys (blue keys).\n• Unauthorized users receive the data, but they cannot decrypt the CardNumber column since they do not have the column-level encryption key (green key). Meanwhile, authorized users can see the information: they do have the required column-level key to decrypt the values stored in the column. Note that this key is not stored in the database and is not even known by the database.\n\nSecurity must be considered not only when designing and creating a database, but also once it is in use. There are several administration tasks that will help keep the database secure.\n\nImplement comprehensive auditing and logging mechanisms to track and monitor activities within the database. This includes:\n• Login Attempts: Both failed and valid-but-suspicious login attempts (i.e. from strange locations, outside regular office hours, etc.) should be logged and reviewed.\n• Sensitive data access: Every time-sensitive data is accessed, either by authorized or non-authorized users, it should be logged and monitored.\n• Sensitive and authorization data modification: Any change to sensitive data or login information (username, password, security questions, email recovery address, etc.).\n\nAuditing allows you to identify suspicious behavior, track changes to sensitive data, and investigate potential security incidents. Ensure that audit logs are securely stored and regularly reviewed to detect any unauthorized access or suspicious activities. Most database products include several mechanisms both to capture and analyze audit information, like Audit Vault in the Oracle database.\n\nImplement regular backups of your database to protect against data loss due to hardware failures, natural disasters, or malicious attacks. Encrypt the backup files and store them in secure off-site locations. Test the recovery process periodically to ensure that backups are valid and can be restored when needed.\n\nStay up to date with the latest patches and updates for your database management system. Vendors often release security patches to address vulnerabilities and improve the overall security of their software. Regularly applying these updates helps protect your database against known security flaws and reduces the risk of unauthorized access."

        "document": "As you might imagine, good database schema design is essential to making your data tractable. With a solid schema design in place, you can better make sense of your database and build the dashboards, reports and data models that you need.\n\nIn this article, we’ll run down the basics of database schema design, some best practices and how Fivetran provides normalized schemas to make life easier for analysts. Read on to learn more.\n\nA database schema is a blueprint representing a data set's tables and relations. In other words, it’s the foundation for interacting with and using your data.\n\nSchema design is especially important when working with raw data “from the source” since raw data feeds from SaaS APIs are seldom organized in a way that’s usable to analysts. At best, data from APIs are organized to accommodate general analytics use cases, but only those predicted by the provider. This might include pre-joined tables and pre-calculated fields (i.e., denormalization).\n\nAs a result, it’s almost always better to design your own database schema. While there’s a bit of thought involved, it’s not too difficult if you understand the data model and follow schema design best practices.\n\nThough there are many ways to design a database schema, all good designs share a few common characteristics. At Fivetran, our designs attempt to meet the following principles:\n\n2. Normalization to create a single source of truth and maintain data integrity\n\n3. Constructing an entity-relationship diagram (ERD) that clearly represents the following types of databases or relationships:\n\n4. Standardization to allow templated analytics products to be built on top of schemas\n\nThese principles represent a substantial investment of time, effort and expertise. Before you can start designing, however, it’s important to understand the underlying data model.\n\nThe first and most important step to leveraging data from an application is to understand the underlying data model behind it.\n\nUnfortunately, many APIs are poorly designed and documented, and some API endpoints can be both complicated and inconsistent. For example, the columns representing the same data are sometimes named inconsistently between tables.\n\nIn any case, data from API endpoints tend to arrive in a non-tabular format like JSON. From these formats, there are several ways to build an understanding of how an app behaves.\n\nOur developers attempt to accomplish this by doing the following:\n• Use the app themselves\n• Speak with the users of the app\n• Speak with the developers of the app (and/or the API)\n\nSimple enough, right? Every SaaS app implicitly contains a representation of the world since the world consists of organizations, people, transactions and other common business concepts. Understanding these representations, then, is essential to understanding the data.\n\nOnce you understand the data model and what it represents, you can begin to design your database schema in a way that best reflects it. Keeping this general goal in mind is helpful during the planning stage, which is the first of our database design best practices.\n\nThe more upfront planning you do, the easier everything will be down the line.\n\nThat’s why upfront planning is not only our top best practice but also the first thing you should do when starting the database design process. Get this step right, and all the other best practices — normalization, ERDs, consistent naming, etc. — will quickly fall into place.\n\nMake sure to keep your target users in mind during the planning phase. One effective way to verify your database design is to allow users to generate a few test reports before full-scale deployment. Their feedback will likely be invaluable as you verify (or modify) your design.\n\nA broader discussion of the normal forms is beyond the scope of this article, but, in a nutshell, normalization strives to eliminate duplicate, redundant and derived data values.\n\nAt Fivetran, we often define our data integration workflow as ELT (extract, load, transform), but in reality, it’s more like E-t-LT. Fivetran performs a small transformation (t) for all of our app connectors that involves a modest amount of cleaning, massaging and reorganizing before the data is loaded into the data warehouse.\n\nNormalization is only possible after a large, upfront investment of work to understand the underlying data model of the app. The knowledge that is painstakingly gleaned from API documentation, experience using the app, and consultation with the app developers, helps us understand the business logic performed by the app and how it represents real-world concepts. Then, we identify data columns that are redundant, duplicative or derived from other values, disaggregate or eliminate them, and construct an entity-relationship model.\n\nEntity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) are visual representations of schemas or entity-relationship models. They represent the interrelations between tables. For example, the ERD below is what Fivetran builds for the Asana connector.\n\nNote that every table has a primary key denoting the basic entity that the table represents and uniquely identifies each row in that table. Foreign keys are simply primary keys from other tables. They connect the entity represented by the primary key with another entity represented in another table.\n\nUsing primary and foreign keys, we can represent the following relationships in most database types:\n• One-to-one. Two entities can only map onto each other and no other elements. A real-world example would be Social Security numbers, which only ever map onto one person. In Fivetran ERDs, if we encounter a nested object that has a one-to-one relationship with the main table, we simply flatten its data into columns.\n• One-to-many: One entity in a table can correspond with multiple records in another table, but not vice-versa. An example of one-to-many might be a list of favorite colors and the customers who like them. Each color can have many devoted customers, but every customer only has a single favorite. If we encounter a nested object that has a one-to-many relationship to the main table, it is turned into a separate table.\n• Many-to-many. These relationships are represented in join tables. The composite primary key in a join table consists of the primary keys of the two related entities. For instance, a person’s shopping habits might bring them to many stores, and each store will have many customers.\n\nThe ERD of a normalized schema allows the app’s underlying data model to be represented in a clear and concise manner. All Fivetran ERDs can be found in our documentation.\n\nData from a normalized schema is not necessarily useful for analytical purposes out-of-the-box, as the data has been arranged on the basis of real-world logical relationships rather than the computed and derived values commonly used for reporting, analytics and training algorithms.\n\nLuckily, while there are as many ways to design a denormalized schema as there are opinions, there are only a handful of plausible normal forms. Standardizing on normalized schemas is a way to create the lowest common denominator that can be later transformed to enable virtually every use case.\n\nSince the KPIs of many business intelligence dashboards, such as sales and marketing funnels, revenue reports, customer attribution, and so forth, are well known and similar across customers, it is possible to transform the data into a denormalized form for such use cases. That is what we at Fivetran are doing with our analytics templates, which are a set of tools to help our analyst users denormalize the Fivetran data with SQL and dbt (data build tool) into a form that meets their specific analytical needs.\n\nOne of the best ways to avoid database headaches is to use naming conventions for fields, tables and every other data element.\n\nNo matter what you’re naming, names should be clear, consistent and meaningful to your audience. You should strive to make names clear enough that they can be understood at first glance. That may mean avoiding high-level jargon that might confuse the user but would otherwise be accurate.\n\nAnd when we say consistent, we mean it: Naming conventions should be the same across your entire database. Some basic rules to follow include not using system-reserved labels for table names or column names, as well as avoiding hyphens and punctuation that may cause confusion or application code errors.\n\nYour data is valuable — which means it deserves top-notch security from the start.\n\nInstead of leaving things to chance, follow “security by design” as you plan your schema. Examples of security by design include establishing an encryption method, permissions (read: not everyone gets to be a database administrator), authentication for database access and so on.\n\nWhile these points may seem obvious, planning your security from the start is one of the most effective ways to avoid hackers and other security threats.\n\nDespite all this planning, your schema isn’t necessarily set in stone. Instead, it’s a living, breathing thing that will see a multitude of changes and updates over its lifetime.\n\nKeeping up with these changes isn’t just good practice — it’s essential for keeping things clear and organized. To do so, you should maintain ongoing documentation that describes current implementations, their changes, and the reasoning behind them. Even things as simple as explaining relationships between different tables can go a long way in making your database usable.\n\nGood schema design requires a substantial investment of time and talent. At the end of the day, however, adopting a standardized solution allows you to leverage the expertise of people who have made themselves intimately familiar with the data you want — so you don’t have to.\n\nTo experience for yourself how Fivetran automates data integration, sign up for a free trial or get in touch with a product specialist."

        "document": "Poorly designed databases can cause many problems, including a waste of resources, difficult maintenance, and faulty performance. That's why having a great database schema design is a crucial part of effective data management.\n\n\"Great database schema design\" is certainly easier said than done, though. Since a given domain or business problem can be modeled in infinitely different ways, it stands to reason that there are comparatively fewer ways of doing it correctly.\n\nThat's why it's so important to learn principles and best practices when it comes to database schema design. And that's exactly what this post is about.\n\nWe'll start with some basics, explaining what a database schema is and why it's important. Then, we'll talk about how you create schemas in practice. Last but not least, we'll get into the practical part of the post, in which you'll see an example of database schema design. Let's dig in.\n\nBefore you roll up your sleeves to design a database schema, you must have a solid understanding of what that even is and why it matters so much.\n\nA database schema, in a nutshell, is the way a given database is organized or structured. Not all types of databases make use of a rigid schema—NoSQL databases such as MongoDB come to mind. However, the ones that do will require you to have a structure in place before you start adding data to your database.\n\nRelational database systems—such as Postgres or MySQL—rely on having a schema in place so you can work with them. So that's the first reason a database schema is important: you literally can't have a database without one.\n\nAlso, a sloppy design can give you headaches. If your schema isn't structured in an optimal way—e.g., it doesn't follow normalization—that might result in duplicated or inconsistent data. On the other hand, it's possible to get to the other extreme where your queries become slow.\n\nTo sum it up, database schema design is essential because you want your databases to work as efficiently as possible.\n\nHow do you create a database schema in practice?\n\nHaving explained what a database schema is and why it's important, let's now walk you through how you can design one.\n\nThe tools of the trade\n\nThere are mainly two tools you'd use to create a database schema. The first is an RDBMS, or a relational database management system. Examples of RDBMSs include SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.\n\nThe second and most important tool is SQL (structured query language). This is the language we use to define the tables, columns, indexes, and other artifacts in our database.\n\nSure, there's nothing wrong with using diagramming programs—or even pen and paper—to define the overall design of a database. But in order to implement the database in practice, you'll need a real RDBMS and SQL.\n\nFor our database schema design example, we'll use PostgreSQL as our RDBMS. The demo database schema we'll design will be for a fictional bookstore.\n\nThe snippet of code above, besides defining a schema, also creates a table in it, which we call . The table has three columns:\n• , which is a unique identifier for each genre\n• , which is a unique name for each genre\n• and , which is a brief, optional description\n\nA bookstore certainly needs information about authors, so let's create a table for that as well.\n\nWith the table, we can manage data about authors, using three columns:\n• again, a numerical, auto-incremental , which serves as a unique identifier\n• a —this time without a \"unique\" constraint, since it's perfectly fine for two authors to have the same name\n\nWe're now getting closer to being able to store the books themselves. Let's create a table for that:\n\nThe table is more involved than the previous ones. Besides the usual unique numerical identifier, a display column—in this case, \"title\" instead of \"name\"—and a description, this table also contains a column called (an International Standard Book Number) and, most interestingly, a foreign key constraint.\n\nIn a nutshell, foreign keys are what allow us to connect tables together. In this case, the column in the table references the columns from the table . That way, it's possible to express the relationship between those two entities. To use the jargon, we've defined a one-to-many relationship. In other words, a single genre can have one or more books assigned to it. On the other hand, there's no way to assign more than one genre to a book since the column can only point to a single row at a time.\n\nYou might have noticed that our table doesn't have any relationship to authors. Couldn't we just include another foreign key in the table, connecting it to authors, the same as we did for ? Sure, that would be possible. However, remember that our requirements state that books can have more than one author.\n\nSo an author might be associated with many books, while a book might have more than one author. That's what we call a many-to-many relationship. There's no way we can design that relationship by adding a column to the or to the table.\n\nInstead, our solution here is to create a third table, which will hold foreign keys to both authors and books:\n\nIn this third table, we reference both _id and . We also have an extra column, , of type boolean—that is, it can be true or false and indicates whether a given author is the main author of the book specified in the relationship.\n\nThat's a lot to keep track of (and we've just scratched the surface!), so here's how all those tables fit together:\n\nWith the schema we designed so far, we're able to store and manage information about a simple bookstore. Keep in mind that a real-world schema for a bookstore would probably be much more complex. However, our example should be enough to give you an idea of what is involved in creating a database schema.\n\nDatabase schema design: What comes next?\n\nIn this post, we've offered you an intro to the concept of a database schema. You've learned what a schema is, why it's so important, and how one is created. Then, we've walked you through an example of designing a basic yet functional database schema for a fictional bookstore.\n\nFrom deciding which tables contain which data to how they connect, there's a lot that goes into creating an efficient database schema. And there's nothing more irritating than creating a complex schema and then having to enter all that info into your data warehouse software.\n\nThat's where Panoply comes in. Along with providing code-free data connections and managed storage, Panoply automatically detects your database schemas so the data you ingest is right where you expect and ready for analysis.\n\nTo learn more about how Panoply makes working with your data easier, book a personalized demo."

        "document": "As a developer, creating new apps and features is the highlight of the job. But it’s equally important to recognize the importance of database schemas. Sure, they’re not glamorous, but understanding these structures is an essential component of your development toolkit.\n• Scalability: Proper organization makes it easier to scale up without compromising performance.\n• Success: A good schema can significantly impact the overall success of your app/website.\n\nThink about the chaos of organizing code without a clear structure — it’s a bit like working with data that lacks a solid schema.\n\nBy mastering schemas, you’ll not only elevate your product’s performance but also streamline your development process, making your work more efficient and manageable. Let’s take a closer look at this product developer essential.\n\nA database schema is a plan that shows how app and website data is stored and used. Just like building blueprints show where doors and windows go, the schema shows how product data is organized, which makes it easier to manage.\n\nThe schema includes fields, indexes, and tables, which hold data in rows and columns. Each row is a piece of data, and each column is a type of data. Indexes help you find information within the tables quickly, and constraints set rules that the data must follow to be correct and consistent. The schema also shows how tables are linked through keys, which connect data from different tables.\n\nTL; DR: A database schema is a blueprint for a database. It guides how to keep data accurate, secure, and easy to manage.\n\nDatabase schemas are important because they help keep data organized and running smoothly.\n\nThis, in turn, improves how quickly and effectively you can retrieve your data, update it, or scale it as needs change. By turning raw data into useful information, schemas support smart decision-making and strategic plans.\n\nDatabase schemas also make it easier to manage security by controlling who can see or change different parts of the database. This level of control also improves quality and consistency because you’re limiting who can hop in and change things.\n• Help different systems work together\n• Help you manage data security thanks to different access options\n• Make it easier to scale up without losing speed or reliability\n\nThe short answer? Anyone who works on a product, either directly or indirectly.\n• Database administrators (DBAs) need schemas to make sure the database runs smoothly. They use schemas to avoid duplication and help keep app and website data organized.\n• Programmers work with database schemas to build apps and websites. They rely on schemas to know how the data they work with is stored and how their programs use it. This helps them write code that interacts with the database correctly.\n• Everyday database users also interact with schemas, even if they don’t know the system itself. Their actions rely on schemas to get the right data when they need it. With a well designed schema, users can trust the data they access is accurate and up to date.\n\nSeveral types of database schemas cater to different needs, each with unique characteristics and benefits.\n\nA simple database model where data is stored in a single two-dimensional table or file.\n• Cons: Lack of relationships between data fields; not ideal for large-scale databases.\n\nData is organized in a tree-like structure with a single root and various levels of hierarchy.\n• Cons: Complex to manage and lacks flexibility; difficult to reorganize.\n\nAn extension of the hierarchical model with more flexible relationships among data.\n• Cons: Complexity in implementation and management; can become unwieldy for large datasets.\n\nOrganizes data into tables where relations are defined between different entities.\n• ase of use; supports SQL; widely adopted and understood.\n• Cons: Performance can suffer if not optimized; it requires designing a normalized schema.\n\nA type of relational schema with a central fact table connected to dimension tables.\n• Cons: May require more storage space; redundancy can lead to update anomalies.\n\nAn extension of the star schema where dimension tables are normalized into multiple related tables.\n• Pros: Reduces data redundancy; can handle more complex queries and analysis.\n• Cons: More complex queries due to multiple joins; can increase query times.\n\nLet’s take a moment to clarify two important terms. Proper understanding of both helps you manage the system, so it’s all set for future growth.\n\nA database instance is like the active environment of the database system, handling operations like data processing and transactions. It manages access to data and ensures everything runs smoothly and securely. A bit like how a cashier manages the till and the flow of money (data) in and out of it.\n\nOn the other hand, a database schema is the blueprint of the database, setting out how data is organized in tables and columns, without dealing with the actual data itself. It gives the framework that the database instance needs to function. So to go back to our till analogy, the schema is like the slots in the till that tell the cashier where the 5, 10, and 20 dollar bills go.\n\nBoth the instance and schema impact how data is stored, accessed, and maintained, so it’s important to know their unique functions.\n\nDatabase schema design, also known as ‘database modeling,’ is about translating business needs into a structured format that allows for good data management. These databases are used by a range of roles, including system admins, programmers, and general database users.\n\nA well-designed schema acts as a guide for database developers and admins, helping them create a system that supports queries, transactions, and data retrieval operations, as well as maintain data integrity via rules and constraints.\n• Entities and relationships: Identifying the entities that represent real-world objects or concepts and defining how they relate to one another is fundamental. This involves establishing one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationships.\n• Attributes: Defining attributes for each entity, like customer names, product details, or transaction dates, is essential. Each attribute has a data type and constraints, ensuring data is stored in a consistent format.\n• Constraints: Implementing constraints helps maintain data correctness, like ensuring a customer’s age is within a plausible range or a product’s price is positive. Constraints can be entity-based or relational, drawing on rules that span across different tables.\n• Indexes and keys: Indexes improve data retrieval speeds, and keys — primary, foreign, and candidate keys — are critical for defining relationships and ensuring data integrity.\n\nDesigning a database schema involves several steps to make sure it meets an organization’s needs. Here’s a simplified breakdown of the process:\n• Understanding data needs: Designers start by looking at what the organization needs from the data. They collect information about how data moves and identify key items and how they relate. It’s important during this stage to include different perspectives to get a full picture.\n• Creating a visual map: Next, schema designers create a basic diagram, known as an entity-relationship diagram (ERD), to show key items, their details, and how they connect. This stage helps organize everything clearly but doesn’t worry about storage details just yet.\n• Building the logical structure: Next, designers turn the visual plan into a detailed outline that a database can use. Define tables, columns, what type of data goes where, and set up connections using identifiers like primary and foreign keys.\n• Designing the storage plan: Finally, designers decide how to store the data physically in the chosen database system. They consider aspects like how data is indexed, split up (partitioned), and any performance tweaks for speed.\n• Testing and feedback: Finally, they use testing and feedback to iron out any problems. They repeat the process to ensure everything works smoothly.\n\nHow to integrate database schemas into a system\n\nSometimes you need to integrate schemas within a database system, so the information can be shared and used across different systems.\n\nBusinesses might choose to integrate schemas for various reasons, e.g. mergers, where different databases need to work together, or when departments aim to consolidate their data for better decision-making.\n\nThis process requires compatibility between schemas, meaning they should use the same data format and naming conventions to avoid issues like duplicates when combining data from multiple sources.\n\nTo do this well, you need a clear strategy for managing differences in data types and structures, plus proper documentation, which helps admins and developers understand the system.\n\nWhen integrating schemas, you should aim to meet the following four requirements.\n• Normalization, to avoid independent relationships and entities being put together in the same table. This is especially true for source-specific schema elements, which should not be grouped with overlapping schema elements if the grouping puts independent entities or relationships in the same place.\n• Minimality, to make sure no source elements of the schema are lost.\n• Documentation, to help with maintenance.\n\nTo create a reliable and useful database schema, you’ll need to follow a few ground rules. Here are some key principles to guide you through the process.\n\nWhile normalization can help you avoid duplicate data and keep consistency, doing it too much can make queries slow and complex. Find a balance by normalizing to keep data correct but don’t make it inefficient. Denormalize when necessary, especially if you’re mostly reading data, to make reading faster.\n\nClear, consistent names for tables, columns, indexes, and keys make the database easier to read and manage. Use meaningful names and decide on singular or plural forms for names throughout your schema.\n\nThink about future growth by making sure your schema can manage more data and users. Be ready to split data into different databases or use methods like sharding if needed.\n\nMake your database fast by using indexes wisely to speed up query processing, but don’t overdo it as too many indexes can slow down writing data. Always check query performance to find and fix slow areas.\n\nSet up strict rules like primary keys, foreign keys, unique rules, and checks to keep data correct. This reduces errors and enforces rules directly in the database.\n\nProtect sensitive info with access controls and encryption. Make sure personal and sensitive information follows laws like GFPR or HIPAA.\n\nGood documentation is vital for managing your schema well. Write down why you made certain design choices, how the tables and fields should be used, and any assumptions or limits. This helps with future work and bringing new team members on board.\n\nThe first design of your schema is rarely perfect. Regularly check and improve your schema to match changing business needs and tech updates. Feedback from real use can show where you need to make improvements.\n\nDesign better database schemas with tools built for the job\n\nWhen it comes to managing products, and especially for creating database schemas, having the right tools can make all the difference. Product management tools like Backlog are designed to simplify complicated tasks, making it easier for teams to work together and get things done faster.\n\nThanks to automatic data collection and continuous integration capabilities, developers can spot problems sooner rather than later, helping avoid costly redos later on. And, by making processes smoother and automating manual tasks, Backlog gives teams the space they need to focus on what they do best: coming up with ideas for great products that make their users’ lives better.

        "document": "MySQL’s popularity as an open-source relational database management system (or RDBMS) is prolific within the data world. In fact, it’s the system of choice for some of the world’s favorite websites and web applications including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, WordPress, and phpBB to name only a few. As you can imagine, with so much data and a wide variety of consumer applications, it is vital to keep this data secure. Whether you’re new to MySQL or need a refresher, consider this a useful crash course to ensuring the safety of your MySQL databases – not to mention the private data your clients and customers entrust your business to safeguard. In this article, you will learn about:\n\nWhile MySQL has been around since the mid-90s, it is one of the most popular database servers still used. As of writing, MySQL comes in two main flavors: the open-source MySQL Community Server and Oracle’s proprietary MySQL Enterprise Server. Compared to other SQL and non-SQL databases, some of MySQL’s benefits include ease of use, scalability, customizability, high availability, platform- and interface-friendliness, and the open-source version’s license is cost-free. \n\nHowever, MySQL isn’t without its drawbacks. These include a limitation on triggers (they cannot be defined on views) or, if you choose to use a storage engine other than InnoDB, MySQL will no longer comply completely with SQL standards.\n\n\n\nStill, with its wide variety of plugins, tools, software availability, and cloud deployment options, MySQL continues to be a favorite among developers, especially within the web application space.\n\nOne of the most common problems is assigning the wrong kinds of account access to users. Nothing is worse than treating every user as an administrator or giving them powerful privileges such as access to root accounts. In the hands of malicious actors (or even well-meaning users prone to accidents), that kind of power can cripple your database and ruin the data along with it. Establish this habit if you haven’t already: give every user the least amount of privileges needed to do their work within the database. Moreover, keep access to important features such as the user table within the mysql system database to root accounts only.\n\nOne of the most common brute force attacks on a MySQL database is distributed denial of service (or DDoS) attacks. Attackers use multiple accounts to overwhelm the database with fake queries in rapid succession. The purpose of this kind of attack is to slow down and eventually crash the database. A few ways to mitigate DDoS attacks are by limiting maximum connections, disabling persistent connections, and closing opened connections that result in code errors. It goes without saying that in a normal deployment, you should not even expose your database to the world. Then, DDoS mitigations can also be applied at the application level.\n\nData inputs that haven’t been properly sanitized can also cause remote preauth user enumeration vulnerabilities. These kinds of attacks are used to validate whether or not a certain user exists within the database so the attacker can identify accounts to use as points of entry. This is done by calling different usernames within the instance to get the database to throw an error. From there, the attack can validate if the account username exists and begin trying to force entry. These kinds of attacks can be mitigated by ensuring all user-generated inputs are sanitized before being sent to the database.\n\nRace condition (also known as a Time of Check to Time of Use or TOCTTOU attack) are when a system tries to perform multiple operations simultaneously instead of executing them in their correct sequence. This can also happen when two processes try to access the same resource at the same time, competing for it. TOCTTOU attacks can cause a variety of errors reading and writing data and can either lead to unintended behavior or to denial of service. Because race condition attacks rely on processes trying to run out of sequence or compete for the same resources simultaneously, methods to protect against these attacks include avoiding share states, using thread synchronization, and serializing memory and storage access. Moreover, certain race condition issues can be resolved by performing atomic operations. With that in mind, it’s important to close any loopholes that might cause simultaneous calls to a single resource.\n\nAdhere to the principle of least privilege. It is common for users to have more privileges than they actually need. This is often done due to using common users instead of separate users, a bottleneck of access requests handled by the DBAs, or simply not revoking access after it’s no longer needed. In addition to adding security risks, this can cause other problems like data corruption and other operational issues. Instead, grant users just enough privileges and access to do their jobs, and revoke it as soon as it’s not needed. There’s no need for salespeople to have access to HR records or for marketers to have access to their fellow employee’s SSNs.\n\n\n\nFinally, be sure to adjust user privileges and access accordingly depending on their position, work, and need especially when they’re being changed to a new position or department within the organization."

        "document": "When it comes to managing databases, security can often be overlooked, as they are sometimes seen as a means to an end. MySQL, one of the most popular relational database management systems, is used across various industries to store and manage critical data. However, proactive steps need to be taken to ensure the security of a MySQL database to safeguard against potential vulnerabilities and cyber threats.\n\nMySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It’s admired for its robustness, scalability, and performance, making it a favored option for powering dynamic web applications, content management systems, and more.\n\nThe significance of MySQL security is underscored by the sensitive nature of the data it contains and processes. Without robust security measures, MySQL databases are prone to various security threats, such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and SQL injection attacks.\n\nOver the years, Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) have been identified in MySQL, highlighting the importance of securing the databases, one such example being CVE-2020-14868 in MySQL Server which allows high privileged attackers to exploit a flaw, leading to unauthorized access and potential data manipulation.\n\nHow to Improve the Security of a MySQL Database?\n\nWhen improving the security of a MySQL database, it’s important to take care when implementing procedures and policies for the following:\n\nMySQL has powerful built-in authentication plugins to restrict access to authorized users only. These plugins allow MySQL to support a wide range of authentication methods, from system-based authentication like PAM (useful for integrating with a server’s existing login systems) to more secure SHA-256-based and multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods.\n\nSome of the plugins, such as , are deprecated and outdated and may pose security risks if used.\n\nMySQL can limit where users are connecting from, allowing only certain network addresses or machines to access the database, and can enforce password policies by enabling the validate_password component to prevent the use of weak passwords.\n\nRunning in your server is a good start to understand which user can connect from there, and which plugin they are using.\n\nMySQL’s authorization mechanisms are designed to finely control what authenticated users can and cannot do within the database. These permissions can be very granular, ranging from the ability to read or write data in specific tables, to more administrative tasks like managing user accounts.\n\nAdministrators can grant or revoke these permissions, tailoring access rights to the needs of different users or groups of users. It also supports the concept of role, which is essentially a collection of permissions that can be assigned to users based on job functions or responsibilities.\n\nThese controls ensure that users have just enough access to perform their tasks, adhering to the principle of least privilege and enhancing the security of the database environment.\n\nYou can use to display which accounts have access to what, and to take those privileges away.\n\nMySQL supports encrypted connections between clients and the server using Transport Layer Security (TLS). It’s strongly recommended to always enable TLS for MySQL connections to safeguard against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nFor environments that require a higher level of security, MySQL offers the option of TLS client’s certificate verification, and commercial Transparent Data Encryption (TDE). Such solutions can help meet specific regulatory requirements, such as PCI-DSS, GDPR, and HIPAA regulatory standards.\n\nYou can start by checking if SSL is enabled in your MySQL server’s global variables, and make sure that all of your users have been created with the option.\n\nAfter all of the horror stories that have come out over the years involving passwords stored in plaintext, it should be common sense to add a bit more security here. Using strong hashing algorithms is seen as the standard path to adding security to stored passwords, but this can be enhanced further.\n\nStarting from version 4.1, MySQL introduced SHA-256-based encrypted passwords for internal users. It also improved the salting and caching, enhancing both security and performance during authentication.\n\nApplications that leverage databases should also use cryptographically secure hashing on their end: NIST recommends using algorithms like PBKDF2 or bcrypt together with SHA-256 to improve robustness against dictionary attacks.\n\nKeep MySQL and the underlying operating system software up to date with the latest security patches and updates. Regularly check for security advisories and apply patches promptly to mitigate known vulnerabilities.\n\nEnable database logging and auditing features to track database activities and identify any suspicious behavior. Monitor database logs regularly for signs of unauthorized access, SQL injection attempts, and other security incidents. You should also seek to periodically review the database configurations to ensure they have not been changed and they are in line with your organization’s policies.\n\nAdopt secure coding practices when developing applications that interact with MySQL databases. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks and sanitize user input to mitigate security risks.\n\nSecureFlag offers comprehensive application security training labs designed to equip developers, IT professionals, and security enthusiasts with the knowledge and skills needed to secure MySQL databases effectively.\n\nThrough hands-on labs, interactive exercises, and expert-led courses, SecureFlag doesn’t just ask multiple-choice questions but instead requires participants to understand MySQL’s security features, identify vulnerabilities, and implement best practices to mitigate risks.\n\nSecuring a MySQL database is essential for protecting sensitive data and maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of information. By following best practices such as implementing strong authentication, encryption, regular updates, and secure coding practices, organizations can enhance the security posture of their MySQL databases and mitigate the risk of security breaches. With the help of platforms like SecureFlag, individuals and teams can acquire the necessary skills and knowledge to secure MySQL databases and defend against evolving cyber threats effectively.\n\nEnhancing MySQL database security begins with understanding the threats, knowing the best practices, and equipping oneself with the right skills – all achievable with the right training and tools."

        "document": "MySQL is an open source RDBMS (relational database management system). It is based on Structured Query Language (SQL) and runs on many platforms, including Windows, Linux, and UNIX. MySQL is also provided as a service on all popular public cloud platforms including Amazon, Azure, and Google Cloud.\n\nMySQL is part of LAMP, an open source web development platform. The LAMP enterprise stack consists of Linux (operating system), Apache (web server), MySQL (RDBMS), and PHP (object-oriented scripting language), Perl, or Python.\n\nMySQL helps support various use cases, including web applications and online publishing scenarios. It powers websites and consumer-facing and corporate web-based applications, such as Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook.\n\nWant More Tech News? Subscribe to ComputingEdge Newsletter Today!\n\nDatabases store sensitive information, which is vulnerable to many threats—including data loss and theft, privacy violations, availability issues, and malicious or accidental modifications. These issues can occur due to various reasons, including outside attackers, malicious insiders, and accidental action.\n\nOpen source databases like MySQL typically pose security concerns related to secure communication and access controls, as well as open source security risks such as known and zero-day vulnerabilities.\n\nExcessive privileges, for example, can allow users to gain needless access to confidential information. This issue can escalate to privilege abuse, enabling authorized users to misuse their privileges to perform unauthorized actions. While you can use access control policies and query-level access control to mitigate these threats, many more issues may arise. For example, it may not prevent threat actors from escalating low-level access to high-level privileges.\n\nPlatforms and operating systems often contain vulnerabilities, which can lead to leakage and data corruption. You can mitigate this using a patch management process alongside vulnerability assessment.\n\nHowever, vulnerability assessment cannot prevent threat actors from using SQL injection to send unauthorized database queries to trick the server into revealing information. You need to use prepared SQL statements to mitigate this threat. Databases are also exposed to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks that can make resources and databases unavailable, denying users access to data or applications.\n\nThe following best practices can help you enhance the security of your MySQL database.\n\nThe default mapping for MySQL is to run on port 3306. You should change this setting after installing MYSQL to conceal the ports on which your critical services run. Attackers typically target default settings first, so it is important to modify them to avoid exploits.\n\nYou should run MySQL under a dedicated user account that contains the minimal permissions required to run a service. Don’t let MySQL run directly as a root server. In addition to the advantages of logging and auditing, avoiding root-level privileges helps ensure that attackers cannot hijack the root user account to gain access.\n\nIf you run MySQL in a cloud environment, your cloud provider will likely offer security services to protect your database. For example, Azure lets you protect your open source relational database using Microsoft Defender to detect anomalous behavior that may indicate malicious attempts to access the server. AWS offers AWS Shield to help secure applications and databases from a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.\n\nBy default, MySQL creates a history file upon installation, storing it under ~/.mysql_history. You should delete this file because it details the history of your installation and configuration. If compromised, malicious actors could use it to expose critical database user passwords. You should also create a soft link from the history file to a null device to prevent MySQL from logging events to the file.\n\nMySQL 8.0.19 introduced a temporary account locking function. You can set up MySQL to lock a user account based on variables such as the number of failed login attempts and the account lock time.\n\nRun the following script to enable account locking when you create a user account:\n\nThe value that follows the failed login attempts variable specifies the number of failed attempts required before locking the account. The value that follows the password lock time variable specifies the time (in days) the account will be locked. You can also specify “unbounded” as the password lock time value to keep the account locked indefinitely until it is manually unlocked.\n\nAuthentication plugins enable users to select their preferred authentication method. MySQL supports numerous pluggable authentication options, which you can combine for greater security. You can use an authentication plugin alongside statements like ALTER USER or CREATE USER.\n\nThis query uses native password hashing to implement authentication.\n\nThe SHOW DATABASES command allows users to view sensitive information. You should restrict the use of this command to prevent remote users and malicious actors from collecting data about your databases. You can restrict or remove this function in the MYSQL configuration file by specifying “skip-show-database” in the [mysqld] section.\n\nEncrypt Data at Rest and in Transit\n\nBy default, MySQL uses unencrypted communication between the server and client, which provides an opportunity for attackers to intercept data via a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack. Likewise, any user data left unencrypted in the database could compromise the user’s integrity and privacy.\n\nYou can use TLS/SSL encryption to protect MySQL communication between networks. Communications within a protected network might not require encryption. MySQL also lets you encrypt data at rest to secure your stored data in the event of a server breach.\n\nMySQL allows you to apply password policies, requiring non-privileged users to set a new password while entering their current password. This function can protect your database from several threats, such as attackers who have compromised the host machine and are trying to access user database sessions with a Web Shell. With password policy changes enabled, the attackers cannot lock the target user out of the compromised account unless they have the user’s existing password.\n\nMySQL does not enable the Change Current Password policy by default. You can control this policy on an individual user basis or globally (enforcing it across all non-privileged user accounts). It is recommended to set the policy globally, or at least to cover all non-privileged users. Use the my.cnf server file to enable a global current password policy.\n\nIn this article, I explained the basics of MySQL security and provided several best practices that can make your database more secure:\n• Modify port mappings – avoid keeping default ports because they are known by attackers.\n• Avoid running MySQL with root privileges – this can allow the compromise of the database to lead to privilege escalation on the host machine.\n• Secure MySQL in the cloud – accidental exposure to cloud-based databases can have catastrophic consequences.\n• Disable and delete MySQL history – this prevents attackers who gain access to a database account from gleaning valuable data.\n• Lock users’ accounts on suspicious activity – use built-in MySQL features to lock accounts after too many failed login attempts.\n• Use authentication plugins – ensure your database has strong authentication.\n• Restrict or disable database visibility – disable the SHOW DATABASES command that can provide sensitive information to attackers.\n• Encrypt data at rest and in transit – encryption can prevent exposure of sensitive data even if the database is compromised.\n• Enforce secure password policies – MySQL lets you set policies to ensure that users and administrators have passwords that are not easily guessable.\n\nI hope this will be useful as you improve the security posture of your MySQL databases."

        "document": "Have you ever read a news story about a major company experiencing a data breach that exposed millions of customer records? These breaches can be devastating, causing significant financial losses, reputational damage, and even legal repercussions. Unfortunately, MySQL databases, one of the most popular relational database management systems, is at the heart of many critical applications, making it a prime target for cyberattacks.\n\nAlthough a data breach may appear to be a remote risk, it’s essential to take proactive measures to secure your MySQL databases. This article is for developers, DBAs, and security experts aiming to strengthen their MySQL setups. We will discuss vital security best practices that can reduce the risk of data breaches and protect sensitive information.\n\nThe first line of defense in securing your MySQL database involves implementing strong User Management and Access Control (UMAC) practices. These practices guarantee that only approved users gain access to your database and possess only the essential privileges needed to carry out their designated tasks.\n\nHere are some key UMAC principles to implement:\n\nFollow the principle of least privilege: Users should only be granted the permissions they absolutely need for executing their assigned jobs within the MySQL database. Avoid giving users more access than they require, as this reduces the potential damage if their credentials are compromised.\n\nAvoid root users for everyday tasks: The MySQL root user has complete control over the database server. Using the root user for routine actions like running queries or managing users is a considerable security risk. Instead, create separate user accounts with limited access for day-to-day operations.\n\nCreate dedicated user accounts with restricted privileges: For each user who accesses your MySQL database, create a separate user account with the bare minimum of permissions required for their role or application. This minimizes the consequences of a compromised user account.\n\nConduct regular permission reviews and revocations: Regularly evaluate user permissions and revoke any unneeded or excessive privileges. This guarantees that your UMAC remains effective and prevents users from gaining unnecessary access over time.\n\nConsider Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implementing RBAC in complicated environments with many users can help to simplify UMAC. RBAC allows you to assign roles with predefined permissions, which can then be assigned to users, making permission management more efficient and easier to manage.\n\nAlongside User Management and Access Control, enforcing password policies is another critical aspect of MySQL database security. Strong passwords greatly reduce the likelihood of unauthorized access from brute-force attacks or compromised credentials. Below are the fundamental elements of effective password policies:\n• Password length : Enforce a minimum password length, ideally 12 characters or more. Longer passwords are exponentially more difficult to crack.\n• Character types : Require passwords to include a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. This makes them more resistant to various hacking techniques.\n\nEncourage password changes: Although there is some debate about the appropriate frequency, it is recommended that users change their passwords on a regular basis. This minimizes the likelihood of compromised credentials remaining valid for extended periods.\n\nEstablish password lockout policies: Set your MySQL server to disable user accounts after several consecutive failed login attempts. This strategy helps counteract brute-force attacks, where attackers attempt to decipher a password through multiple login attempts using various combinations.\n\nConsider Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): MFA increases security by requiring a second verification factor in addition to a username and password. This could include an SMS code, a mobile authentication app, or a security key. MFA significantly minimizes the likelihood of unauthorized access, even if an attacker knows a user’s password.\n\nIn addition to user access control and robust passwords, securing your MySQL server further entails deactivating unused features, services, and protocols to minimize the potential for attacks. Additionally, if remote access to your MySQL server isn’t necessary, completely block it. If remote access is needed, use a firewall to restrict incoming connections to designated IP addresses or ranges and implement secure protocols such as SSL/TLS.\n\nHere are some key database hardening practices to implement:\n\nDisable unused features and services: The MySQL server offers a variety of features and services catering to different functionalities. Identify and disable any features or services you don’t use in your specific environment. This reduces the potential attack surface, as vulnerabilities might exist in unused components.\n\nKeep MySQL software up-to-date: Regularly update your MySQL server software to the latest stable version. These updates often include critical security patches that address newly discovered vulnerabilities. Running outdated software exposes your database to known exploits that attackers can leverage.\n\nRemove unnecessary test databases or default accounts Test databases or default accounts created during installation might still exist in your environment. If you’re no longer using them, remove these unnecessary accounts and databases to eliminate potential security risks.\n\nRestrict remote access (when possible): If remote access to your MySQL server isn’t required for administrative tasks, consider disabling it altogether. This significantly reduces the attack surface, as attackers would need direct access to your server to exploit vulnerabilities.\n\nImplement firewall controls: Utilize a firewall to limit incoming connections to your MySQL server. Configure the firewall to only allow connections from authorized IP addresses and ports typically used by MySQL. This adds an additional layer of security by filtering out unauthorized traffic.\n\nEncryption adds another layer of defense for your critical MySQL data. It scrambles information using mathematical algorithms, rendering it unreadable without a decryption key. Even if attackers gain access to your database storage or network traffic, the encrypted data remains useless without the key.\n\nWhen implementing encryption, follow best practices for encryption algorithms and secure key management (including regular key rotation) and comply with your region’s industry-specific compliance requirements.\n\nThere are two primary data encryption options to consider for your MySQL database:\n• Encrypt data at rest: Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) or full-disk encryption safeguards data files on the server’s storage system. This ensures that even if attackers access the storage drives, the data remains encrypted.\n• Encrypt data in transit: This method encrypts data traveling between your application and the MySQL server over the network. This protects your sensitive information from being intercepted during transmission.\n• Confidentiality: Encryption ensures that only authorized users with the decryption key can access your sensitive information. Even if attackers manage to breach your database defenses, the encrypted data remains unreadable, protecting its confidentiality.\n• Data breach protection: Encrypted data provides an extra layer of protection in the unfortunate event of a data breach. Attackers who gain unauthorized access to your database will be unable to decipher the encrypted information, significantly reducing the potential impact of the breach on your organization.\n• Regulatory compliance: Many regulations across various industries mandate encryption for sensitive data. Implementing data encryption for your MySQL database can help your organization meet these compliance requirements. ( We’ll cover compliance considerations later in this blog post\n\nWhen considering data encryption for MySQL, it’s important to be aware of encryption algorithms and key management strategies.\n• Encryption algorithms: The algorithm you choose determines the level of security for your encrypted data. A strong choice is AES-256, a widely trusted and well-established algorithm that offers robust encryption.\n• Key management: Securing your encryption keys is critical. These keys are essential for decryption, and if compromised, attackers could potentially access your encrypted data. A key management strategy includes:\n• Secure key storage : Implement secure methods for storing your encryption keys, such as Hardware Security Modules (HSMs).\n• Regular key rotation : Regularly rotate your encryption keys to minimize the risk of compromise even if an attacker gains access to an older key.\n\nSQL injection continues to be a significant threat to applications using databases like MySQL. It occurs when malicious SQL code is inserted into an input field to execute unauthorized commands, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or manipulation of the database.\n\nSQL injection attacks exploit weaknesses in an application’s database layer, typically arising when inputs are inadequately sanitized or validated. This allows attackers to introduce harmful SQL code, with outcomes that may include unauthorized data exposure or even total data destruction.\n• Input validation : Verify all user inputs for type, length, format, and range. Utilize regular expressions to block inputs that include forbidden characters.\n• Use prepared statements and parameterized queries : One of the most effective defenses against SQL injection is to use prepared statements with parameterized queries. This technique keeps SQL code and data separate, ensuring data is strictly treated as input, not executable code.\n• Escaping inputs : Though less comprehensive than parameterized queries, escaping user inputs can also reduce SQL injection risks. This involves adding an escape character before special characters in SQL statements.\n\nProactive security goes beyond initial setup, and ongoing security monitoring and auditing are crucial for continuously safeguarding your MySQL database. Monitoring with software like Percona Monitoring and Management helps keep an eye on database activity to detect any suspicious behavior that might indicate a security breach attempt.\n\nHere’s how you can implement effective security monitoring and auditing for your MySQL database:\n\nMonitoring tools and techniques: Utilize tools and techniques to monitor various aspects of your database activity:\n• None Track login attempts (successful and failed) to identify potential brute-force attacks or unauthorized access.\n• None Monitor for unusual login patterns, such as attempts from unexpected locations or at odd times, to detect unauthorized access attempts.\n• None Analyze database queries for anomalies, such as those accessing unauthorized data, running excessively long, or exhibiting unusual patterns.\n\nMySQL auditing: Enable MySQL auditing to log user actions and database modifications. These logs create a detailed history of operations within your database, which is crucial for identifying and investigating potential security events. Audit logs can document various actions, such as:\n\n\n\nLog analysis: Regularly analyze your security monitoring data and MySQL audit logs. This analysis can reveal patterns or trends that might indicate suspicious activity. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions can be helpful for centralizing and analyzing logs from various security sources, including your MySQL database.\n\nBack everything up — and be able to recover\n\nEven with the best security measures in place, unexpected events can occur. A comprehensive backup strategy allows you to restore your database in case of hardware failures, software errors, or even security incidents like ransomware attacks.\n\nHere are some key considerations for your MySQL backup strategy:\n• Backup frequency: The frequency of backups depends on the criticality of your data and how often it changes. For highly critical databases that change frequently, consider more frequent backups (daily or even more often). Less critical databases might have less frequent backup schedules (weekly or monthly).\n• Secure backup storage: Don’t store your backups on the same server as your MySQL database. This ensures that even if your server is compromised, your backups remain secure. Consider storing backups offsite or in the cloud using a trusted storage provider.\n• Testing backup and restore procedures: Having backups in place is only half the battle. You must regularly test your backup and restore procedures to ensure they function correctly. This involves restoring a backup to a test environment and verifying data integrity. This practice confirms that your backups are reliable and ready for use in recovery scenarios when necessary.\n\nWhile we should always strive to prevent security incidents, it’s important to be prepared in case one occurs. An incident response plan outlines the steps your organization will take to identify, contain, eradicate, and recover from a security breach or other critical event impacting your MySQL database. A clear plan ensures a coordinated and efficient response, minimizing damage and downtime.\n\nHere are some key components of an effective incident response plan for your MySQL database:\n• None Define procedures for identifying and assessing potential security incidents, such as unauthorized access attempts, suspicious database activities, or data breaches.\n• None Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to promptly detect anomalies or indicators of compromise.\n• None Establish a dedicated incident response team with clearly defined roles and responsibilities for different aspects of the response process.\n• None Assign team members based on their expertise, including database administrators, security analysts, legal advisors, and communications personnel.\n• None Outline steps for containing the incident and preventing further damage, such as isolating affected systems, revoking compromised credentials, or implementing network access controls.\n• None Define procedures for eradicating the threat, such as removing malware, patching vulnerabilities, or restoring systems from trusted backups.\n• None Establish processes for recovering and restoring your MySQL database environment to a known good state after the incident has been contained and the threat eradicated.\n• None Leverage your backup and disaster recovery strategies to restore data and services while maintaining data integrity.\n• None Define communication protocols and channels for informing relevant stakeholders, such as executive management, legal teams, and regulatory authorities, about the incident and its impact.\n• None Establish reporting procedures for documenting the incident, including root cause analysis, lessons learned, and recommendations for improving security posture.\n• None After the incident is resolved, conduct a thorough post-mortem analysis to understand what happened, how it happened, and how to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\nThe best security practices involve a proactive approach. Security testing plays a vital role in identifying and addressing weaknesses in your MySQL database before attackers exploit them. Regular security testing allows you to continuously evaluate your defenses and uncover potential vulnerabilities.\n• Proactive threat identification: Security testing uncovers vulnerabilities in your MySQL server setup, user access controls, and database applications, allowing you to rectify these issues before they are exploited.\n• Improved security posture: By actively identifying and fixing vulnerabilities, you significantly improve your MySQL security. This reduces your system’s vulnerability and makes it more difficult for attackers to gain unauthorized access to your data.\n\nThere are two main types of security testing to consider for your MySQL database:\n• Vulnerability assessments: These automated scans identify known vulnerabilities in your MySQL software, configuration, and potentially even database applications, providing valuable insights into potential weaknesses that need to be addressed.\n• Penetration testing: Penetration testing involves simulating a real-world attacker’s attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in your MySQL environment. Penetration testers attempt to gain unauthorized access to your database using various techniques, mimicking attacker behavior, which can reveal deeper security issues that might be missed by vulnerability assessments.\n\nMany organizations are subject to various compliance regulations that dictate how they handle and secure sensitive data. These regulations can have specific requirements for securing databases like MySQL, where personal information or other regulated data might be stored.\n\nSeveral compliance regulations can impact how you secure your MySQL database, depending on your industry and the type of data you store. Here are some examples:\n\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): The GDPR applies to organizations processing the personal data of individuals residing in the European Economic Area (EEA). It mandates specific security measures to protect personal data, including measures to secure databases.\n\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA): HIPAA applies to healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses that handle patients’ protected health information (PHI). It mandates implementing security measures to safeguard electronic protected health information (ePHI) stored in databases.\n\nPayment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS): While not directly focused on databases, PCI DSS applies to organizations that process, store, or transmit payment card data. It includes requirements for securing databases that store cardholder data, including controlling access, encrypting sensitive data, and regularly testing security controls.\n\nMeeting the specific security requirements of relevant compliance regulations can be complex. Here are some general guidelines for aligning your MySQL security practices with regulatory demands:\n\nIdentify applicable regulations: The first step is understanding which compliance regulations apply to your organization based on your industry, location, and the type of data you handle.\n\nReview regulation requirements: Carefully review the specific security requirements outlined in the relevant regulations. These requirements often focus on aspects like access control, data encryption, logging and auditing, and vulnerability management.\n\nConduct a gap analysis: This can help identify any discrepancies between your current MySQL security practices and the regulatory requirements.\n\nImplement compliance-focused security measures: Based on the gap analysis, implement necessary security measures to address compliance requirements. This might involve strengthening access controls, encrypting sensitive data, implementing logging and auditing practices, and regularly testing your security posture.\n\nMaintain compliance: Maintain your MySQL security posture and regularly review compliance requirements to ensure continued adherence to evolving regulations.\n\nRemember, this is a general overview of data compliance. Be sure to consult with legal or compliance professionals to ensure your organization meets its specific regulatory obligations regarding MySQL security.\n\nYour MySQL security efforts extend beyond technical controls. By educating users on security best practices, you can significantly reduce human error, a major contributor to security breaches. This training equips users to identify and avoid potential security threats, ultimately strengthening your overall database security posture.\n• Reduced human error: Many security incidents involve social engineering tactics that exploit human vulnerabilities. Training users on how to identify phishing attempts and suspicious emails can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to these attacks.\n• Stronger password habits: Educating users on creating strong passwords and practicing good password hygiene, such as avoiding password reuse and enabling multi-factor authentication, can significantly improve your overall password security.\n• Improved security vigilance: Training users to recognize and report suspicious activity within your MySQL environment can provide valuable early warnings of potential security incidents.\n\nHere are some key security awareness training topics you can consider for users who interact with your MySQL database:\n• None Emphasize the significance of protecting sensitive data stored in MySQL databases and the potential consequences of data breaches, such as financial losses, reputational damage, and regulatory penalties.\n• None Highlight the role of each individual in maintaining data security and the shared responsibility across the organization.\n• None Educate users on the importance of creating strong, unique passwords for their accounts, using a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.\n• None Discourage password reuse across multiple accounts and encourage the use of password managers to securely store and manage complex passwords.\n• None Train users to identify common signs of phishing emails, such as suspicious sender addresses, urgency tactics, and requests for sensitive information or credentials.\n• None Emphasize the importance of reporting suspected phishing attempts to the appropriate security teams for further investigation and mitigation.\n• None Encourage users to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activities they encounter within the MySQL environment, such as unusual login attempts, unauthorized access attempts, or unexpected database queries.\n• None Establish clear reporting channels and procedures to ensure that potential security incidents are promptly addressed.\n\nIt’s clear that there’s a consistent theme in our discussion: securing a MySQL database environment demands ongoing vigilance, proactive planning, and adherence to best practices.
