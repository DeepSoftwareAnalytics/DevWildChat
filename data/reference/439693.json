        "document": "Based on the fast speed and simplicity of Weixin Mini Programs and on the principle of fully respecting users' right to know and right to operate, these design guidelines and recommendations are intended to create a friendly, efficient, and consistent user experience within the Weixin ecosystem, while fulfilling a variety of requirements as far as possible, and achieving a mutually beneficial situation for both users and the Mini Program service providers.\n\nIn order to avoid disruptions due to complex environments while users are using the Mini Program service in Weixin, the Mini Program should be designed to minimize user disruption from unnecessary design elements. Users are to be given a courteous introduction to the services the program offers and friendly operational guidance.\n\nEvery page must have a clear key focus so that the user can quickly understand the content of the page whenever a new page is opened. After you determine the key focus, try to minimize the disruption to your users from unnecessary elements that are not relevant to user decisions and operations on the page.\n\nTo create a smooth user journey, avoid interrupting users with unnecessary elements that are not related to the user's goals when the user performs an operation.\n\nWhenever a user enters our Mini Program, we have the responsibility and obligation to clearly inform users where they are currently and where they can go from their current location, and to ensure that the user can easily browse through pages without getting lost. This enables us to offer the user a safe and enjoyable experience.\n\nCritical to protecting users from getting lost when browsing through pages, navigation must inform the users of matters including the current location, possible destinations, and how to get back. Weixin does not provide a uniform navigation bar style in Mini Programs. You can design the navigation bars in the Mini Program homepage and secondary pages as needed. We advise you to include an operation to return to the previous page in the upper left corner of secondary pages. In addition, iOS users can return to the previous Mini Program or Weixin page by swiping to the right from the edge of the screen. Android users can do this by pressing the \"Back\" button.\n\nFor all pages of the Mini Program, including embedded webpages and plug-ins, Weixin will place an official Mini Program menu in the upper right corner (as shown below). Developers cannot customize its content, but they can choose a light/dark base color to suit the design of the page. The official Mini Program menu has a fixed position in the page. Do not place other items in this position during design. When you need to add interactive elements around this menu, be aware whether the interactive event will conflict and whether the operation is easy to use.\n\n# Color scheme for the Mini Program menu (iOS and Android)\n\nWhen the menu's usability is guaranteed, you can select Weixin's dark/light color scheme for your Mini Program menu according to your needs.\n\nYou can add your own navigation within the page based on your functional design requirements. Consistency in the navigation operations should be maintained across all pages to facilitate movements backward and forward. Due to the limited size of the mobile screen, try to keep your Mini Program page navigation operations simple and easy. It is recommended to design your Mini Program navigation bar obviously different from the official Weixin Mini Program menu for easy distinction.\n\nYou can add tabs to the pages of the Mini Program to aid navigation. The tab bar can be fixed at the top or bottom of the page so that users can switch between different tabs easily. The number of tabs should be between two and five (both inclusive). In order to ensure sufficient space for easy tapping, it is recommended to use not more than four tabs. A single page should only contain one tab bar.\n\nYou can use Weixin's bottom tab style in the homepage of the Mini Program. This style is specifically designed for the homepage of the Mini Program. You can customize the icon style, tab text, text color and others during development. For specific settings such as icon size, refer to the Development Documentation and the WeUI basic control library.\n\nYou can customize the color of the top tab bar. When selecting the color, you must be aware of the usability, visibility, and accessibility of the tab bar.\n\nExcessive wait times on pages will lead to user dissatisfaction, but using the technology offered by Weixin Mini Programs significantly reduces wait times. When loading and waiting cannot be avoided, prompt feedback must be given in order to reduce user dissatisfaction.\n\nThe Mini Program start-up page is one of the Mini Program pages providing the chance for a certain degree of branding display in Weixin. This page highlights the Mini Program brand's special features and loading status. Elements on the start-up page other than the brand logo, such as the loading progress indicator, are provided by Weixin by default and cannot be altered. You do not need to develop these elements.\n\nWeixin offers the standard swipe-down-to-refresh/load feature and style within Weixin Mini Programs. You do not need to develop this feature.\n\nYou can define the loading style for Mini Program pages. For both local and global loading, keep the custom loading style as plain as possible and use simple animations to inform the user of the loading progress.\n\nThe modal loading style will cover the entire page. It is not possible to clearly indicate the specific loading location or content, which may cause concern on the part of the user. For this reason, it must be used with caution. Modal loading should only be used for certain global operations.\n\nLocal loading feedback only provides feedback on the page that triggers loading. This feedback mechanism is more focused and entails less page movement. Weixin recommends this form of feedback. For example:\n\nDevelopers can refer to the styles in the images and use the title bar to indicate the progress of loading the Mini Program page content. For example:\n• For a long loading time, you should provide a cancel operation and add a progress bar to show the loading progress.\n• During the loading process, animation effects should be displayed continuously. Their absence can give the false impression that the interface has frozen.\n• No more than one loading animation should be used on a single page at the same time.\n\nApart from offering prompt feedback while the user is waiting, clear feedback should also be provided with regard to the results of an operation. Depending on the actual situation, you can choose between several feedback styles. For local operations, direct feedback can be given in the operation area. For the results of page-level operations, pop-up notifications, modal dialog boxes, or result pages can be used.\n\nFor local operations, direct feedback can be given in the operation area. The figure below provides before-and-after images for tapping multiple selection controls. For common controls, Weixin Design Center provides a control library, in which the controls all come with complete operation feedback.\n\nIcon-style pop-up notifications are suitable for lightweight operational prompts that do not provide important information, such as notifications that indicate success. These notifications will automatically disappear after 1.5 seconds without interrupting the current process and have less impact on users. Please note that brief icon-style pop-up notifications are not suitable for error prompts, which must clearly inform the user of the important information.\n\nText-style pop-up notifications are suitable for prompting minor errors or errors that need to use short text to explain the situation. They will automatically disappear after 1.5 seconds without interrupting the current process and have less impact on users.\n\nIf an operation result must be clearly acknowledged by the user, use a modal dialogue box to display the notification and provide directions for the next operation.\n\nIf the operation result indicates the end of the current process, use the operation result page as feedback. This clearly informs the user that the operation ends. You can also provide directions for the next operation according to the actual needs.\n\n# Control Exceptions and Provide a Way Out\n\nWhen you design any task or process, abnormal states and processes are often overlooked. These are the situations where users become dissatisfied and need help. Therefore, special attention must be given to these exceptions. When an exception occurs, users must be given the necessary prompts and offered a solution.\n\nIn the event of an exception, a user may stay on a page without knowing what to do. To avoid this problem, use the modal dialog box and result page methods mentioned above to report exceptions. Additionally, in form pages, especially in those which contains many items, the incorrect items should be clearly indicated in order to facilitate modification by the user.\n\nWhen an error occurs in a form, give the cause of the error at the top of the form and indicate the error field to prompt the user to make necessary modifications.\n\nAlthough input is simple and convenient on mobile devices, mobile input is more error-prone than using a physical keyboard and mouse. To adjust to this change, you must make full use of mobile phone features in their designs, providing users with a convenient and elegant interface.\n\nSince the mobile keyboard area is small and congested, data input can be difficult and errors are easily made. Therefore, when designing the Mini Program's pages, use existing APIs or other easy-to-use controls to minimize user input and improve the input experience.\n\nFor example, in the figure below, in the bank card addition process, a camera recognition API is used to facilitate user input. Besides, Weixin team provides various Mini Program APIs (such as the geographic position API), via which you can greatly improve user input efficiency and accuracy, and further enhances the user experience.\n\nApart from the use of APIs, in cases where manual input cannot be avoided, let users select from a few options rather than input via the keyboard. On the one hand, recognition is easier than recall. It is easier for users to select from a few options than to input something they have to recall from memory. On the other hand, single-key input on the congested mobile phone keyboard is very likely to make mistakes. In the figure below, a few options generated from the user's search history are provided to help the user perform a quick search, reducing or avoiding unnecessary keyboard input.\n\nA mobile interface is handled by touching the screen with your fingers. This method is much less accurate than a mouse. Therefore, when designing controls that are to be touched on the page, the touch area must be carefully considered. This will help avoid incorrect operations due to the size of the touch area being too small or too congested. Such problems easily occur when an interface which was originally designed for a computer screen is directly transferred to a mobile phone without making any adaptations. As different mobile phones have different resolutions, the pixel size suitable for tapping also varies. However, after conversion into physical measurements, a size of 7 mm to 9 mm is acceptable. In the standard component library provided by Weixin, touch effects and adaptations for different screen sizes have been considered for the control elements. Therefore, we highly recommend you use or simulate standard control sizes during design.\n\nThe Weixin Design Center has already introduced a set of web page standard control libraries, including the Sketch Design Control Library and Photoshop Design Control Library. The Mini Program components will continue to be improved in the future. All these controls already fully take the distinctive properties of mobile pages into consideration, which ensures usability and operationality on the mobile screens. At the same time, the Weixin Development Team is constantly improving and expanding the Weixin Mini Program APIs and providing more common libraries. These resources not only offer the user faster service, but also greatly benefit page performance, improving user experience.\n\nApart from the above principles, we recommend that access to Weixin Mini Programs always adheres to the principles of consistency and continuity between different pages, and that consistent controls and interactive modes be used as much as possible on different pages.\n\nProviding consistent page experience and continuous interface elements are the best way to reduce the discomfort that arises when jumping from page to page. Because of this, you can develop a Mini Program in a consistent and stable manner as required by using standard controls offered by Weixin.\n\nThe fonts within Weixin should be consistent with the fonts of the system running Weixin. Common font sizes are 20, 18, 17, 16, 14, 13, and 11 (pt). Specific use cases are as follows:\n\nUse black for primary content and gray for secondary content. Light gray is the default value for timestamps and forms. Use semi-black for large areas of descriptive text that form part of primary content.\n\nBlue is used for links, green for successfully completed actions, and red for errors. In Press and Disable statuses the level of transparency is decreased by 20% and 10% respectively.\n\nIn order to facilitate design, Weixin offers a set of basic control libraries for web design and for use in Mini Programs. It also offers resources that are easy for developers to call."

        "document": "Wechat mini program has been online since Jan.9th, 2017, which is a html program for the corporation to build up a light version of its app or web. Users don’t have to download any application except Wechat to use these mini programs, ranging from entertainment, finance, traveling, gaming, catering, to news applications, etc.\n\nRecently I have the chance to design a Wechat mini program relating to diabetes track and diagnosis. This article is mainly written to share my experience and findings of designing a Wechat mini program, especially the differences between its and apps.\n\nCompared to an app, the mini Wechat tends to be more light. It is said that the program is produced to satisfy users’ specific needs, like health mini for health tracking, takeaway mini for food ordering, and knowledge mini for knowledge sharing, etc (as image 1).\n\nMoreover, one page should include a simple action, avoid multiple options or actions on a page. For instance, it is better to exclude popup ads banners in an article or a list of view to avoid interruption. Referring to action button, one primary with a secondary one is the best, instead of offering multiple actions.\n\nIf you ever use or design a mini program, you will find that the navigation is quite simple with usually 2 to 4 tabs (as image 1 & 2). The program is designed to satisfy users specific needs, therefore the structure should be as simple as possible.\n\nDifferent from an app, the mini program has a fixed title bar on the right side, including menus and home. The menu bar can be voice record or position location instead. You can easily go back to Wechat when touching on the home bar on each page or add mini program to your desktop without downloading another app.\n\nThough it is a simplified program, the UI design is suggested to be consistent with the original app/website, to deliver a consistent experience for the user. From typography, color, spacing, size to icons, there are a series of instructions: Mini platform design guideline."

        "document": "As of January 2022, WeChat Mini Programs have exceeded 450 million daily active users. In order to develop a program for this fast-growing market, you should understand some basics.\n\nIn general, Mini Programs are designed for users to duck quickly into and out of them to do specific tasks. So your user interface should be simple and easy to understand instantly for occasional users.\n\nAvoid anything that requires users to leave and return to your Mini Program. They should be able to accomplish all tasks in one quick session.\n\nBe sure that key elements of your Mini Program – such as crucial images, content, menus and interfaces – do not require a user to be online.\n\nDo not try to replicate the functionality of your native app. Instead, keep your Mini Program focused on offering your core features only, and direct users to download your native app for additional features. Depending on your app, you may also consider creating multiple Mini Programs that offer different sets of features.\n\nFor example, a traditional restaurant application and ordering app may offer restaurant search and reviews in one Mini Program, while confining the ordering features to a separate one.\n\nIn fact, if you reserve high-value tasks for your native app, it provides a strong incentive for users to download your native app and increase your DAU and organic reach. In this way, your Mini Program acts as an effective marketing tool for your core offering.\n\nDo not deviate from established Mini Program and WeChat conventions. Consider simplifying your navigation to single level, in which users can move horizontally forward and backward. Your navigation should be obvious. Keep a back button in your app on the top bar, as the standard back button on the Android phone will cause the user to exit the Mini Program entirely, causing frustration for users who accidentally tap it to go back. Study other Mini Programs and try to emulate their style to avoid reinventing the wheel.\n\nTest on as many different screen sizes and orientations as you can to make sure there are no content overflows. Also test on both iOS and Android devices.\n\nRemember that users who don’t often upgrade their WeChat app and/or device operating systems may experience errors with your program. To avoid them getting a blank white screen (otherwise known as a WSOD – White Screen of Death), have a good error handling system in place.\n\nLeverage the sharing abilities of your WeChat Mini Programs by including a well-composed sharing card and easy-to-see sharing options in the upper-right menu (where it normally appears). If you create additional value for users who share, it will incentivize and encourage users to spread your message and program. Take advantage of your ability to customize the Call To Action in these cards for each instance.\n\nAdd a pop-up notification to remind users to save the Mini Program to their favorites, so they can easily access it later. Users may forget to do this otherwise.\n\nAdd login walls only where they are truly needed. Users may exit your Mini Program immediately if the first thing they see is a prompt to log in before they can do anything else. A good rule of thumb is: If you don’t need user information, don’t ask for it.\n\nUse a simple, minimal “skeleton screen” that loads instantly while a user is waiting for your Mini Program to load. Also consider add a loading bar that clearly shows the user how long they will need to wait. Both of these tools help reduce bounce rates for users with a slow connection.\n\nUse the WeChat API to preload users’ information into forms, thus saving them time and increasing the value of the Mini Program.\n\nAppInChina builds WeChat Mini Programs for our clients.

        "document": "Our user studies in China found that embedded-app designers must consider the context of use, the core functionality of the parent platform, and how the programs will be used.\n\nWeChat, the most popular social application in China, had 1 billion monthly active users as of March 2018. WeChat’s integrated services cover all aspects of daily life in China, including social communication, shopping, bill payments, news, and booking services. A product update at the end of 2017 introduced a new major function in the app: WeChat mini programs (including mini games). Mini programs are similar to apps, but they are built within WeChat: they feel like apps within a larger app. Thus, a Chinese company can interact with users of mobile devices on four distinct channels:\n• WeChat official account for that company\n• WeChat mini programs [the main focus of this study]\n\nWe wondered how people perceive the difference between these different channels and whether certain tasks are better suited to one channel than to another. To find out, we conducted a usability-testing study with 10 WeChat users in Beijing.\n\nEven if you won’t be designing a WeChat mini program, the user-experience implications of this type of extensible user interface are interesting. Traditionally, websites and software applications are closed packages that can’t be extended by users or third-party providers. In contrast, the WeChat mini programs are a different experience architecture, related to products such as:\n• Add-ins for broad software packages, such as browser toolbars and spreadsheet toolpacks (e.g., statistical analysis features that can be added into Excel for those few users who perform ANOVAs, without confusing the vast masses)\n• Facebook Messenger App, which supports third-party games, news, and shopping services within the Games and Discover sections of the app.\n• Integration apps offered by SaaS (Software as a Service) companies (For example, Slack users can install integrations that allow them to link to a Google Calendar event or a Trello card directly from within the Slack application.)\n\nFor those not familiar with mini programs, below are a few examples of what they are and how they work.\n• Mini programs are mobile apps built for and within the WeChat platform. There are mini programs for games, food delivery, shopping, ticket sales, home services, image editing, and more.\n• Users don’t need to install (or uninstall) a mini program. In our research, many users mentioned this feature and believed that it would help save storage space on their phone.\n• Discovery happens primarily from online social sharing and offline QR-code scanning. Many mini games encourage users to share the game with other users in order to earn rewards in the game (e.g., extra lives or bonus points). Offline, ads with QR-codes promote mini programs. For example, a shopping mall advertised a mini program for prepaying parking fees.\n• Mini programs can be accessed from the WeChat home screen, but they’re hidden by default. Because WeChat’s primary function is chatting, the home screen is dedicated to recent conversations. To see mini programs, users need to swipe down from the top; this action reveals a list of recently used mini programs. Although swiping was easy and convenient for regular mini-program users, new or infrequent users weren’t likely to discover programs on their own unless they accidentally swiped down or someone shared a program with them.\n\nOur study revealed insights that designers can apply when developing apps within apps, or in other limited-platform scenarios similar to WeChat’s integrated model.\n\n1. Maintain the core functionality and content that users expect.\n\nPeople who have already used your company’s (full-sized) app have mental models and expectations about the content or services you provide. If a mini version of an application makes it hard for users to find the core content that they want, people will use the app they’re familiar with instead.\n\nDuring our testing, a 36-year-old female user complained that the homepage of the JD shopping mini program was not as informative as the JD mobile app: “On the [mobile app’s] homepage, I can browse for discount information [she swipes through the carousel of images at the top]. It also displays whatever I have viewed and bought, and recommends more similar items. All that info will NOT be shown in the mini program.” She felt that the mini program had less content, and therefore she didn’t want to shop on it.\n\nAnother user, a 24-year-old female, had a similar problem with a mini-program version of a food-delivery service called Meituan. “The first thing I do when I open the delivery app is getting some coupons. That app will automatically show some coupons every time you log in, and I don't know if the mini program will do that.” She opened the mini program and was disappointed: “No, there aren’t any [coupons]. This is all expensive. Also, there aren’t as many promotions displayed [in the carousel] as in the company app.”\n\nIf a mini program can’t do everything that the mobile app can, it should support a handoff solution—an easy way for users to move between the mini program and the mobile app or website to view the full content.\n\n2. Always consider the context of use. On mobile, support quick activities and design for interruption.\n\nDuring our study, many people complained that if a WeChat message arrived while they were in a mini program, they couldn’t easily check the message and then resume their task in the program. Instead, they had to quit the program to view messages. Unfortunately, some mini programs didn’t save users’ progress, forcing them to start over again. Since, at its core, WeChat is a social-communication tool, mini programs should be designed to accommodate multitasking. To minimize the chance of interruption, flows should be efficient and have minimum interaction cost. Here are some suggestions for implementing these principles:\n• Save users’ progress so they can return to a task later. A racing mini game called Happy Ball allowed users to save their progress and come back to it later. A 20-year-old male user complimented this feature: “I play it mainly on public transport and in class when I am bored. It’s all fragmented time. This allows me to stop and go back to it without losing my place, which is good.”\n• Send reminders for users to continue where they left off. Knowing that users may be interrupted during checkout, JD will send a WeChat notification in about half a day if a user left the payment page of the JD mini program without completing the task. This type of reminder can help users who forgot that they’d left something in their shopping cart.\n• Minimize user effort by having good defaults based on WeChat-account data. For example, the JD mini program could automatically fill in users’ information (address and telephone number) on the payment page, because JD accounts are connected to users’ WeChat accounts. Thus, even users who open the JD mini program for the first time could enjoy “one-click payment” and not have to input their details.\n\n3. Take advantage of the platform’s core functionality.\n\nMany users mentioned that they learned about most mini programs and mini games from group chats or from friends. Good mini programs take advantage of the WeChat’s core functionality, which is communication. For example, JD’s mini program promoted group purchases on the homepage even more than the mobile app did. (Group purchases work by offering a discount on a product if enough people agree to purchase the item. If an item doesn’t get enough orders, no one gets the product.) The emphasis on group purchases makes sense in the WeChat context, because the platform makes it easy for users to share a link to their WeChat friends and invite them to participate in a group purchase.\n\nEncouraging users to share is good for your business. However, don’t overdo it! During our testing, many users complained that mini programs, especially mini games, forced them to share content with others. Participants explained, “If I need to share a game to get rewards and keep playing, I’d rather not even get the rewards,” and “Compulsory sharing is the worst.” A 20-year-old male user said, “People will share on their own if you have really good content — Don’t force me to do it like a pyramid scheme.”\n\nMany of our research participants said that they prefer mini programs for services that they only use occasionally, to save space on their phone. For example, a user explained, “If I only have to use the function once a month, I'd use the mini program. For example, dry cleaning. I don’t need to download an app for dry cleaning. I could just use the mini program.” Designers should figure out the needs of occasional users and address them in the mini program directly.\n\nA good example is the SF Express mini program for postal shipments. Compared with the more comprehensive mobile app, this mini program addressed occasional usage by centering the design around the most common user task, Schedule pickup.\n\nInfrequent use requires extreme usability and an emphasis on quick learning, because you can’t assume that users will accumulate knowledge about the design with extended use. Traditional usability guidelines also apply to mini programs. Here’s an example from our study:\n• Design simple navigation for learnability. For example, Carrefour’s mini program used icons and texts in the navigation bar, which was friendly for older adults. A 55-year-old male user who didn’t even know how to search for a mini program could easily browse different categories and items in this program, because it was simple and intuitive enough.\n\nA customer can interact with an organization on many different channels: the mobile app, a mobile website, a desktop website, a WeChat mini program, a WeChat official account, and so on. Designers should consider the entire customer journey, offering a seamless user experience across channels.\n• Simplify channel switching. A good example is how JD shopping notified users when the item they wanted was back in stock. Since, unlike WeChat official accounts, mini programs are not able to send notifications, the JD mini program offered a QR-code of the corresponding JD WeChat official account; following this account allowed users to receive messages from JD and find out when their item became available. During our testing, a user followed this process and got a notification for the VR glasses he wanted to order. He commented, “It is very considerate of this company.”\n• Deliver some content before asking users to switch to another channel. Switching between channels has a high perceived cost: users need to believe that the transition is worth the effort in order to make it. During our testing, one mini program required a user to follow the company’s WeChat account to get more information about its products. Because this request was too much too soon (she’d barely opened the mini program and clicked a button), she left the program immediately.\n• Offer easy paths for switching channels. During our study, a 37-year-old female user really liked a mini program, Heika Camera, which could beautify pictures of hercat. She wanted to download the mobile app, but she browsed and couldn’t find any way to access the mobile app from the mini program.\n\nWeChat mini programs are a new interaction channel; such new channels can be expected to arise anywhere, any time. Designers must be nimble and adapt their products to such new ways of interaction.\n\nTo take advantage of these new opportunities, it is important to understand their strengths and limitations. If you find yourself designing an app within an app or designing for limited-functionality channels (e.g., a smartwatch, a voice assistant), keep these points in mind:\n• Add value to the product based on the context and frequency of use.\n• Consider the cost of switching channels and how to make transitions seamless.\n• Deliver content and visuals for that platform’s users."

After you determine the key focus, try to minimize the disruption to your users from unnecessary elements that are not relevant to user decisions and operations on the page.\n\nTo create a smooth user journey, avoid interrupting users with unnecessary elements that are not related to the user's goals when the user performs an operation.\n\nWhenever a user enters our Mini Program, we have the responsibility and obligation to clearly inform users where they are currently and where they can go from their current location, and to ensure that the user can easily browse through pages without getting lost. This enables us to offer the user a safe and enjoyable experience.\n\nCritical to protecting users from getting lost when browsing through pages, navigation must inform the users of matters including the current location, possible destinations, and how to get back. Weixin does not provide a uniform navigation bar style in Mini Programs. You can design the navigation bars in the Mini Program homepage and secondary pages as needed. We advise you to include an operation to return to the previous page in the upper left corner of secondary pages. In addition, iOS users can return to the previous Mini Program or Weixin page by swiping to the right from the edge of the screen. Android users can do this by pressing the \"Back\" button.\n\nFor all pages of the Mini Program, including embedded webpages and plug-ins, Weixin will place an official Mini Program menu in the upper right corner (as shown below). Developers cannot customize its content, but they can choose a light/dark base color to suit the design of the page. The official Mini Program menu has a fixed position in the page. Do not place other items in this position during design. When you need to add interactive elements around this menu, be aware whether the interactive event will conflict and whether the operation is easy to use.\n\n# Color scheme for the Mini Program menu (iOS and Android)\n\nWhen the menu's usability is guaranteed, you can select Weixin's dark/light color scheme for your Mini Program menu according to your needs.\n\nYou can add your own navigation within the page based on your functional design requirements. Consistency in the navigation operations should be maintained across all pages to facilitate movements backward and forward. Due to the limited size of the mobile screen, try to keep your Mini Program page navigation operations simple and easy. It is recommended to design your Mini Program navigation bar obviously different from the official Weixin Mini Program menu for easy distinction.\n\nYou can add tabs to the pages of the Mini Program to aid navigation. The tab bar can be fixed at the top or bottom of the page so that users can switch between different tabs easily. The number of tabs should be between two and five (both inclusive). In order to ensure sufficient space for easy tapping, it is recommended to use not more than four tabs. A single page should only contain one tab bar.\n\nYou can use Weixin's bottom tab style in the homepage of the Mini Program. This style is specifically designed for the homepage of the Mini Program. You can customize the icon style, tab text, text color and others during development. For specific settings such as icon size, refer to the Development Documentation and the WeUI basic control library.\n\nYou can customize the color of the top tab bar. When selecting the color, you must be aware of the usability, visibility, and accessibility of the tab bar.\n\nExcessive wait times on pages will lead to user dissatisfaction, but using the technology offered by Weixin Mini Programs significantly reduces wait times. When loading and waiting cannot be avoided, prompt feedback must be given in order to reduce user dissatisfaction.\n\nThe Mini Program start-up page is one of the Mini Program pages providing the chance for a certain degree of branding display in Weixin. This page highlights the Mini Program brand's special features and loading status. Elements on the start-up page other than the brand logo, such as the loading progress indicator, are provided by Weixin by default and cannot be altered. You do not need to develop these elements.\n\nWeixin offers the standard swipe-down-to-refresh/load feature and style within Weixin Mini Programs. You do not need to develop this feature.\n\nYou can define the loading style for Mini Program pages. For both local and global loading, keep the custom loading style as plain as possible and use simple animations to inform the user of the loading progress.\n\nThe modal loading style will cover the entire page. It is not possible to clearly indicate the specific loading location or content, which may cause concern on the part of the user. For this reason, it must be used with caution. Modal loading should only be used for certain global operations.\n\nLocal loading feedback only provides feedback on the page that triggers loading. This feedback mechanism is more focused and entails less page movement. Weixin recommends this form of feedback. For example:\n\nDevelopers can refer to the styles in the images and use the title bar to indicate the progress of loading the Mini Program page content. For example:\n• For a long loading time, you should provide a cancel operation and add a progress bar to show the loading progress.\n• During the loading process, animation effects should be displayed continuously. Their absence can give the false impression that the interface has frozen.\n• No more than one loading animation should be used on a single page at the same time.\n\nApart from offering prompt feedback while the user is waiting, clear feedback should also be provided with regard to the results of an operation. Depending on the actual situation, you can choose between several feedback styles. For local operations, direct feedback can be given in the operation area. For the results of page-level operations, pop-up notifications, modal dialog boxes, or result pages can be used.\n\nFor local operations, direct feedback can be given in the operation area. The figure below provides before-and-after images for tapping multiple selection controls. For common controls, Weixin Design Center provides a control library, in which the controls all come with complete operation feedback.\n\nIcon-style pop-up notifications are suitable for lightweight operational prompts that do not provide important information, such as notifications that indicate success. These notifications will automatically disappear after 1.5 seconds without interrupting the current process and have less impact on users. Please note that brief icon-style pop-up notifications are not suitable for error prompts, which must clearly inform the user of the important information.\n\nText-style pop-up notifications are suitable for prompting minor errors or errors that need to use short text to explain the situation. They will automatically disappear after 1.5 seconds without interrupting the current process and have less impact on users.\n\nIf an operation result must be clearly acknowledged by the user, use a modal dialogue box to display the notification and provide directions for the next operation.\n\nIf the operation result indicates the end of the current process, use the operation result page as feedback. This clearly informs the user that the operation ends. You can also provide directions for the next operation according to the actual needs.\n\n# Control Exceptions and Provide a Way Out\n\nWhen you design any task or process, abnormal states and processes are often overlooked. These are the situations where users become dissatisfied and need help. Therefore, special attention must be given to these exceptions. When an exception occurs, users must be given the necessary prompts and offered a solution.\n\nIn the event of an exception, a user may stay on a page without knowing what to do. To avoid this problem, use the modal dialog box and result page methods mentioned above to report exceptions. Additionally, in form pages, especially in those which contains many items, the incorrect items should be clearly indicated in order to facilitate modification by the user.\n\nWhen an error occurs in a form, give the cause of the error at the top of the form and indicate the error field to prompt the user to make necessary modifications.\n\nAlthough input is simple and convenient on mobile devices, mobile input is more error-prone than using a physical keyboard and mouse. To adjust to this change, you must make full use of mobile phone features in their designs, providing users with a convenient and elegant interface.\n\nSince the mobile keyboard area is small and congested, data input can be difficult and errors are easily made. Therefore, when designing the Mini Program's pages, use existing APIs or other easy-to-use controls to minimize user input and improve the input experience.\n\nFor example, in the figure below, in the bank card addition process, a camera recognition API is used to facilitate user input. Besides, Weixin team provides various Mini Program APIs (such as the geographic position API), via which you can greatly improve user input efficiency and accuracy, and further enhances the user experience.\n\nApart from the use of APIs, in cases where manual input cannot be avoided, let users select from a few options rather than input via the keyboard. On the one hand, recognition is easier than recall. It is easier for users to select from a few options than to input something they have to recall from memory. On the other hand, single-key input on the congested mobile phone keyboard is very likely to make mistakes. In the figure below, a few options generated from the user's search history are provided to help the user perform a quick search, reducing or avoiding unnecessary keyboard input.\n\nA mobile interface is handled by touching the screen with your fingers. This method is much less accurate than a mouse. Therefore, when designing controls that are to be touched on the page, the touch area must be carefully considered. This will help avoid incorrect operations due to the size of the touch area being too small or too congested. Such problems easily occur when an interface which was originally designed for a computer screen is directly transferred to a mobile phone without making any adaptations. As different mobile phones have different resolutions, the pixel size suitable for tapping also varies. However, after conversion into physical measurements, a size of 7 mm to 9 mm is acceptable. In the standard component library provided by Weixin, touch effects and adaptations for different screen sizes have been considered for the control elements. Therefore, we highly recommend you use or simulate standard control sizes during design.\n\nThe Weixin Design Center has already introduced a set of web page standard control libraries, including the Sketch Design Control Library and Photoshop Design Control Library. The Mini Program components will continue to be improved in the future. All these controls already fully take the distinctive properties of mobile pages into consideration, which ensures usability and operationality on the mobile screens. At the same time, the Weixin Development Team is constantly improving and expanding the Weixin Mini Program APIs and providing more common libraries. These resources not only offer the user faster service, but also greatly benefit page performance, improving user experience.\n\nApart from the above principles, we recommend that access to Weixin Mini Programs always adheres to the principles of consistency and continuity between different pages, and that consistent controls and interactive modes be used as much as possible on different pages.\n\nProviding consistent page experience and continuous interface elements are the best way to reduce the discomfort that arises when jumping from page to page. Because of this, you can develop a Mini Program in a consistent and stable manner as required by using standard controls offered by Weixin.\n\nThe fonts within Weixin should be consistent with the fonts of the system running Weixin. Common font sizes are 20, 18, 17, 16, 14, 13, and 11 (pt). Specific use cases are as follows:\n\nUse black for primary content and gray for secondary content. Light gray is the default value for timestamps and forms. Use semi-black for large areas of descriptive text that form part of primary content.\n\nBlue is used for links, green for successfully completed actions, and red for errors. In Press and Disable statuses the level of transparency is decreased by 20% and 10% respectively.\n\nIn order to facilitate design, Weixin offers a set of basic control libraries for web design and for use in Mini Programs. It also offers resources that are easy for developers to call."

        "document": "As of January 2022, WeChat Mini Programs have exceeded 450 million daily active users. In order to develop a program for this fast-growing market, you should understand some basics.\n\nIn general, Mini Programs are designed for users to duck quickly into and out of them to do specific tasks. So your user interface should be simple and easy to understand instantly for occasional users.\n\nAvoid anything that requires users to leave and return to your Mini Program. They should be able to accomplish all tasks in one quick session.\n\nBe sure that key elements of your Mini Program – such as crucial images, content, menus and interfaces – do not require a user to be online.\n\nDo not try to replicate the functionality of your native app. Instead, keep your Mini Program focused on offering your core features only, and direct users to download your native app for additional features. Depending on your app, you may also consider creating multiple Mini Programs that offer different sets of features.\n\nFor example, a traditional restaurant application and ordering app may offer restaurant search and reviews in one Mini Program, while confining the ordering features to a separate one.\n\nIn fact, if you reserve high-value tasks for your native app, it provides a strong incentive for users to download your native app and increase your DAU and organic reach. In this way, your Mini Program acts as an effective marketing tool for your core offering.\n\nDo not deviate from established Mini Program and WeChat conventions. Consider simplifying your navigation to single level, in which users can move horizontally forward and backward. Your navigation should be obvious. Keep a back button in your app on the top bar, as the standard back button on the Android phone will cause the user to exit the Mini Program entirely, causing frustration for users who accidentally tap it to go back. Study other Mini Programs and try to emulate their style to avoid reinventing the wheel.\n\nTest on as many different screen sizes and orientations as you can to make sure there are no content overflows. Also test on both iOS and Android devices.\n\nRemember that users who don’t often upgrade their WeChat app and/or device operating systems may experience errors with your program. To avoid them getting a blank white screen (otherwise known as a WSOD – White Screen of Death), have a good error handling system in place.\n\nLeverage the sharing abilities of your WeChat Mini Programs by including a well-composed sharing card and easy-to-see sharing options in the upper-right menu (where it normally appears). If you create additional value for users who share, it will incentivize and encourage users to spread your message and program. Take advantage of your ability to customize the Call To Action in these cards for each instance.\n\nAdd a pop-up notification to remind users to save the Mini Program to their favorites, so they can easily access it later. Users may forget to do this otherwise.\n\nAdd login walls only where they are truly needed. Users may exit your Mini Program immediately if the first thing they see is a prompt to log in before they can do anything else. A good rule of thumb is: If you don’t need user information, don’t ask for it.\n\nUse a simple, minimal “skeleton screen” that loads instantly while a user is waiting for your Mini Program to load. Also consider add a loading bar that clearly shows the user how long they will need to wait. Both of these tools help reduce bounce rates for users with a slow connection.\n\nUse the WeChat API to preload users’ information into forms, thus saving them time and increasing the value of the Mini Program.\n\nAppInChina builds WeChat Mini Programs for our clients. Contact us for more information."

        "document": "Wechat mini program has been online since Jan.9th, 2017, which is a html program for the corporation to build up a light version of its app or web. Users don’t have to download any application except Wechat to use these mini programs, ranging from entertainment, finance, traveling, gaming, catering, to news applications, etc.\n\nRecently I have the chance to design a Wechat mini program relating to diabetes track and diagnosis. This article is mainly written to share my experience and findings of designing a Wechat mini program, especially the differences between its and apps.\n\nCompared to an app, the mini Wechat tends to be more light. It is said that the program is produced to satisfy users’ specific needs, like health mini for health tracking, takeaway mini for food ordering, and knowledge mini for knowledge sharing, etc (as image 1).\n\nMoreover, one page should include a simple action, avoid multiple options or actions on a page. For instance, it is better to exclude popup ads banners in an article or a list of view to avoid interruption. Referring to action button, one primary with a secondary one is the best, instead of offering multiple actions.\n\nIf you ever use or design a mini program, you will find that the navigation is quite simple with usually 2 to 4 tabs (as image 1 & 2). The program is designed to satisfy users specific needs, therefore the structure should be as simple as possible.\n\nDifferent from an app, the mini program has a fixed title bar on the right side, including menus and home. The menu bar can be voice record or position location instead. You can easily go back to Wechat when touching on the home bar on each page or add mini program to your desktop without downloading another app.\n\nThough it is a simplified program, the UI design is suggested to be consistent with the original app/website, to deliver a consistent experience for the user. From typography, color, spacing, size to icons, there are a series of instructions: Mini platform design guideline."
