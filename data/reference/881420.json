        "document": "Extract substring before or after a specific character Now, take a look at the Contact Names. We can use LEFT to extract the Title used for each person. However, since ‚ÄúMr.‚Äù/‚ÄùMs.‚Äù and ‚ÄúMrs.‚Äù have different string lengths, we have to input num_chars dynamically. If you‚Äôll notice, the period symbol ‚Äú.‚Äù is common to all titles. You can use this as the delimiter which indicates the string length needed. It‚Äôs now just a matter of finding that delimiter in a given text! üîé\n\nNext, you want to extract the First Name. This is not as straightforward as the above examples. To do this, you first have to understand the concepts below.\n\nYou know that the First Name is between the first and second spaces ‚Äù ‚Äù which are in positions 4 and 10 respectively. To get the First Name, you can use MID to extract characters starting from position 5 (character immediately after first space) up to position 9 (character preceding the second space). But how exactly do you type the formula? 1. Getting the starting position for the MID function is easy enough. You use FIND just as in the previous example. But instead of the period symbol, use the space character ‚Äù ‚Äú. Also, add 1 to the result. The starting position formula becomes:\n\n2. To get the position of the second space, you need to use the third input of the FIND function which is start_num. You know that the position after the first space can be given by: You can then use the above formula as the starting position of the second FIND function to find the second space like below:\n\n3. Now, you can combine the above formulas to express the string length input in the final MID function in cell G2. =MID(A2, position AFTER 1st space, position of 2nd space ‚Äì position of 1st space ‚Äì 1 ) So, the final formula in cell G2 will be: You deduct 1 at the end to remove the extra space from the result.\n\nExample 3: Using the Excel LEN function Finally, if you want to extract the Last Name, you use the RIGHT function. Going back to the character count, you know that the Last Name is just the characters from the right of the Contact Name up to the second space.\n\nThis length can be expressed as the length of the entire text minus the position of the second space. You already know how to get the position of the second space from the previous example. So, how do you get the length of the whole text string? You can use the LEN function to get the length of any input string. 1. In cell H2, type the formula below:\n\n3. Finally, complete the RIGHT function by using the formula above as the number of characters to be extracted: 4. Hit Enter and fill in the rows below."

        "document": "The tutorial explains the syntax of the Excel FIND and SEARCH functions and provides formula examples of advanced non-trivial uses.\n\nIn the last article, we covered the basics of the Excel Find and Replace dialog. In many situations, however, you may want Excel to find and extract data from other cells automatically based on your criteria. So, let's have a closer look at what the Excel search functions have to offer.\n\nThe FIND function in Excel is used to return the position of a specific character or substring within a text string. The syntax of the Excel Find function is as follows: The first 2 arguments are required, the last one is optional.\n‚Ä¢ Find_text - the character or substring you want to find.\n‚Ä¢ Within_text - the text string to be searched within. Usually it's supplied as a cell reference, but you can also type the string directly in the formula.\n‚Ä¢ Start_num - an optional argument that specifies from which character the search shall begin. If omitted, the search starts from the 1st character of the within_text string. If the FIND function does not find the find_text character(s), a #VALUE! error is returned. For example, the formula returns 4 because \"d\" is the 4th letter in the word \"find\". The formula returns an error because there is no \"a\" in \"find\".\n\n To correctly use a FIND formula in Excel, keep in mind the following simple facts:\n‚Ä¢ The FIND function is case sensitive. If you are looking for a case-insensitive match, use the SEARCH function.\n‚Ä¢ The FIND function in Excel does not allow using wildcard characters.\n‚Ä¢ If the find_text argument contains several characters, the FIND function returns the position of the first character. For example, the formula FIND(\"ap\",\"happy\") returns 2 because \"a\" in the 2nd letter in the word \"happy\".\n‚Ä¢ If within_text contains several occurrences of find_text, the first occurrence is returned. For example, FIND(\"l\", \"hello\") returns 3, which is the position of the first \"l\" character in the word \"hello\".\n‚Ä¢ If find_text is an empty string \"\", the Excel FIND formula returns the first character in the search string.\n‚Ä¢ The Excel FIND function returns the #VALUE! error if any of the following occurs:\n‚Ä¢ Find_text does not exist in within_text.\n‚Ä¢ Start_num contains more characters than within_text.\n‚Ä¢ Start_num is 0 (zero) or a negative number.\n\nThe SEARCH function in Excel is very similar to FIND in that it also returns the location of a substring in a text string. Is syntax and arguments are akin to those of FIND: Unlike FIND, the SEARCH function is not case-sensitive and allows using the wildcard characters, as demonstrated in the following example. returns 6 because the substring \"market\" begins at the 6th character of the word \"supermarket\". returns 1 because \"e\" is the first character in the word \"Excel\", ignoring the case. Like FIND, Excel's SEARCH function returns the #VALUE! error if:\n‚Ä¢ The value of the find_text argument is not found.\n‚Ä¢ The start_num argument is greater than the length of within_text.\n‚Ä¢ Start_num is equal to or less than zero. Further on in this tutorial, you will find a few more meaningful formula examples that demonstrate how to use SEARCH function in Excel worksheets.\n\n\n\nAs already mentioned, the FIND and SEARCH functions in Excel are very much alike in terms of syntax and uses. However, they do have a couple of differences. The most essential difference between the Excel SEARCH and FIND functions is that SEARCH is case-insensitive, while FIND is case-sensitive. For example, SEARCH(\"e\", \"Excel\") returns 1 because it ignores the case of \"E\", while FIND(\"e\", \"Excel\") returns 4 because it minds the case.\n\n \n\n Unlike FIND, the Excel SEARCH function accepts wildcard characters in the find_text argument:\n‚Ä¢ An asterisk (*) matches any series of characters. To see how it works on real data, consider the following example:\n\n As you see in the screenshot above, the formula SEARCH(\"function*2013\", A2) returns the position of the first character (\"f\") in the substring if the text string referred to in the within_text argument contains both \"function\" and \"2013\", no matter how many other characters there are in between. Tip. To find an actual question mark (?) or asterisk (*), type a tilde (~) before the corresponding character.\n\nIn practice, the Excel FIND and SEARCH functions are rarely used on their own. Typically, you would utilize them in combination with other functions such as MID, LEFT or RIGHT, and the following formula examples demonstrate some real-life uses. Example 1. Find a string preceding or following a given character This example shows how you can find and extract all characters in a text string to the left or to the right of a specific character. To make things easier to understand, consider the following example. Supposing you have a column of names (column A) and you want to pull the First name and Last name into separate columns. To get the first name, you can use FIND (or SEARCH) in conjunction with the LEFT function: As you probably know, the Excel LEFT function returns the specified number of left-most characters in a string. And you use the FIND function to determine the position of a space (\" \") to let the LEFT function know how many characters to extract. At that, you subtract 1 from the space's position because you don't want the returned value to include the space. To extract the last name, use the combination of the RIGHT, FIND / SEARCH and LEN functions. The LEN function is needed to get the total number of characters in the string, from which you subtract the position of the space: The following screenshot demonstrates the result:\n\n For more complex scenarios, such as extracting a middle name or splitting names with suffixes, please see How to split cells in Excel using formulas.\n\n Example 2. Find Nth occurrence of a given character in a text string Supposing you have some text strings in column A, say a list of SKUs, and you want to find the position of the 2nd dash in a string. The following formula works a treat: The first two arguments are easy to interpret: locate a dash (\"-\") in cell A2. In the third argument (start_num), you embed another FIND function that tells Excel to start searching beginning with the character that comes right after the first occurrence of dash (FIND(\"-\",A2)+1). To return the position of the 3rd occurrence, you embed the above formula in the start_num argument of another FIND function and add 2 to the returned value: Another and probably a simpler way of finding the Nth occurrence of a given character is using the Excel FIND function in combination with CHAR and SUBSTITUTE: Where \"-\" is the character in question and \"3\" is the Nth occurrence you want to find. In the above formula, the SUBSTITUTE function replaces the 3rd occurrence of dash (\"-\") with CHAR(1), which is the unprintable \"Start of Heading\" character in the ASCII system. Instead of CHAR(1) you can use any other unprintable character from 1 to 31. And then, the FIND function returns the position of that character in the text string. So, the general formula is as follows: At first sight, it may seem that the above formulas have little practical value, but the next example will show how useful they are in solving real tasks. Note. Please remember that the Excel FIND function is case-sensitive. In our example, this makes no difference, but if you are working with letters and you want a case-insensitive match, use the SEARCH function instead of FIND. Example 3. Extract N characters following a certain character To locate a substring of a given length within any text string, use Excel FIND or Excel SEARCH in combination with the MID function. The following example demonstrates how you can use such formulas in practice. In our list of SKUs, supposing you want to find the first 3 characters following the first dash and pull them in another column. If the group of characters preceding the first dash always contains the same number of items (e.g. 2 chars) this would be a trivial task. You could use the MID function to return 3 characters from a string, starting at position 4 (skipping the first 2 characters and a dash): Translated into English, the formula says: \"Look in cell A2, begin extracting from character 4, and return 3 characters\".\n\n However, in real-life worksheets, the substring you need to extract could start anywhere within the text string. In our example, you may not know how many characters precede the first dash. To cope with this challenge, use the FIND function to determine the starting point of the substring that you want to retrieve. The FIND formula to return the position of the 1st dash is as follows: Because you want to start with the character that follows the dash, add 1 to the returned value and embed the above function in the second argument (start_num) of the MID function: In this scenario, the Excel SEARCH function works equally well: It's great, but what if the group of chars following the first dash contains a different number of characters? Hmm... this might be a problem:\n\n As you see in the above screenshot, the formula works perfectly for rows 1 and 2. In rows 4 and 5, the second group contains 4 characters, but only the first 3 chars are returned. In rows 6 and 7, there are only 2 characters in the second group, and therefore our Excel Search formula returns a dash following them. If you wanted to return all chars between the 1st and 2nd occurrences of a certain character (dash in this example), how would you proceed? Here is the answer: For better understanding of this MID formula, let's examine its arguments one by one:\n‚Ä¢ 1st argument (text). It's the text string containing the characters you want to extract, cell A2 in this example.\n‚Ä¢ 2nd argument (start_position). Specifies the position of the first character you want to extract. You use the FIND function to locate the first dash in the string and add 1 to that value because you want to start with the character that follows the dash: FIND(\"-\",A2)+1.\n‚Ä¢ 3rd argument (num_chars). Specifies the number of characters you want to return. In our formula, this is the trickiest part. You use two FIND (or SEARCH) functions, one determines the position of the first dash: FIND(\"-\",A2). And the other returns the position of the second dash: FIND(\"-\", A2, FIND(\"-\",A2)+1). Then you subtract the former from the latter, and then subtract 1 because you don't want to include either dash. As the result, you will get the number of characters between the 1st and 2nd dashes, which is exactly what we are looking for. So, you feed that value to the num_chars argument of the MID function. In a similar fashion, you can return 3 characters after the 2nd dash: Or, extract all the characters between the 2nd and 3rd dashes: Supposing you have some long text string in column A and you want to find and extract only the text enclosed in (parentheses). To do this, you would need the MID function to return the desired number of characters from a string, and either Excel FIND or SEARCH function to determine where to start and how many characters to extract. The logic of this formula is similar to the ones we discussed in the previous example. And again, the most complex part is the last argument that tells the formula how many characters to return. That pretty long expression in the num_chars argument does the following:\n‚Ä¢ First, you find the position of the closing parenthesis:\n‚Ä¢ After that you locate the position of the opening parenthesis:\n‚Ä¢ And then, you calculate the difference between the positions of the closing and opening parentheses and subtract 1 from that number, because you don't want either parenthesis in the result: Naturally, nothing prevents you from using the Excel FIND function instead of SEARCH, because case-sensitivity or case-insensitivity makes no difference in this example.\n\n\n\nHopefully, this tutorial has shed some light on how to use SEARCH and FIND functions in Excel. In the next tutorial, we are going to closely examine the REPLACE function, so please stay tuned. Thank you for reading!"

        "document": "Excel String Functions and How To Use Them (Plus Tips)\n\nUsing Excel to make work more efficient and manipulate data is something many professionals do, including data analysts, writers and engineers. One aspect of Excel that many people use is string functions. Knowing what string functions are and how to use them can help you improve your computer literacy skills, increase your productivity and decrease the time you spend with Excel spreadsheets.\n\nIn this article, we define string functions, discuss the benefits they offer, explain how to implement them and provide tips for using them more effectively.\n\nString functions are part of the Excel program you can use to alter, locate or measure strings. In Excel, strings are blocks of text that appear within the spreadsheet. These can include names of people, products, email addresses, names of cities and numbers.\n\nThe most recent version of Excel 365 has 30 string functions, which all affect strings in different ways. Below is a list of the functions and what they do:\n\nThis function changes text strings and values into numerical values. For example, it can change the word \"two\" to the value \"2.\" The syntax for this function is:\n\nThis function changes all text within a string to the uppercase. For example, it can change the string \"first name last name\" to the string \"FIRST NAME LAST NAME.\" To write this function, you can use the syntax:\n\nThis function returns the code point value of the first character of the string. For example, it can return a value of \"U+0041\" for the letter \"A\" because that's the code point value of the character. To use this function, you can type the syntax:\n\nThis function returns the character of a code point value. For example, it can return a value of \"A\" for the code point \"U+0041\" because those are the related values. The syntax for this function is:\n\nThis function removes the spaces from text strings. For example, it can change the value of \"D Y L A N\" to the value \"DYLAN.\" To use this function, you can type the syntax:\n\nThis function joins the values from multiple cells or ranges of cells into a single value. For example, if cell A1 has a value of \"Book\" and cell B1 has a value of \"Keeper\" then the function can combine these terms into \"BookKeeper.\" If you want to use this function, you can type the syntax:\n\nThis function formats and changes numeric values to text values. For example, it can change the value of \"15\" into the value \"fifteen.\" The syntax for this function is:\n\n=TEXT(Value you want to format, \"Format code you want to apply\")\n\nThis function converts its components into text but excludes numerical values and logical arguments. For example, if cells A1, B1 and C1 had \"Temperature,\" \"39\" and \"TRUE\" as their respective values, then the return of that range of cells is \"Temperature.\" For this function, you can use the syntax:\n\nThis function changes the old text for a new value in a string.

To use this function, you can type the syntax:\n\nWhen to use Excel string functions\n\nIt's helpful to use string functions when you change large amounts of text such as entire columns, rows or ranges of cells. Since each string function is different, using them only to accomplish what's absolutely necessary can help you save time.\n\nThe string functions are also helpful when you want to create a new table or section of the spreadsheet with data formatted differently but keep the original data. For example, you can change every value in a spreadsheet to read in the dollar currency format, but this is only helpful for numerical values that represent money.\n\nHow to use Excel string functions\n\nWith 30 different string functions to use, there are slightly different rules to follow for each one. Below are three steps you can use to help you understand string functions:\n\n1. Type the function in a blank cell using the \"=\" sign\n\nThe first part of using any string function in Excel is to select a blank cell using your cursor. Once you've selected it, you can type the function, starting with an \"=\" sign. This sign lets the Excel program know you want it to make a calculation or perform a function. After the equals sign, you can type the name of the function from the list above. For example, the cell for the ASC function starts as:\n\n2. Follow the rules for the function\n\nSecond, follow the rules that Excel displays for the function. Each string function has different parts you may enter, such as cell names, cell ranges, text and numerical values. For example, the LOWER function uses \"text\" components. When you type the function, the entire cell reads:\n\n=LOWER([text you want to lowercase])\n\nAfter you follow all the rules for the function, press the \"Enter\" key on your keyboard and wait for Excel to process the function you want it to do. If you're using large amounts of data, these functions may take a long time to process. After the data processes, ensure that the function performed the job you wanted and then save your data for later use.\n\nBelow is a list of tips that can help you use string functions more effectively:\n‚Ä¢ None If possible, format your data prior to needing string functions. This can help you save time by preventing you from having to alter data.\n‚Ä¢ None If you're using large amounts of data, ensure that the string functions affect all the data you want them to and make sure the function didn't alter unintended data.\n‚Ä¢ None Learn about the specific applications of each function because they can help you become more efficient with the Excel program and improve your computer proficiency.\n\nPlease note that the company mentioned in this article is not affiliated with Indeed."
