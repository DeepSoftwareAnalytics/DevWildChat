        "document": "There are various strategies to locate elements in a page. You can use the most appropriate one for your case. Selenium provides the following method to locate elements in a page:\n\nTo find multiple elements (these methods will return a list):\n\nThe attributes available for the class are used to locate elements on a page. These are the attributes available for class:\n\nThe ‘By’ class is used to specify which attribute is used to locate elements on a page. These are the various ways the attributes are used to locate elements on a page:\n\nIf you want to locate several elements with the same attribute replace find_element with find_elements.\n\nUse this when you know the attribute of an element. With this strategy, the first element with a matching attribute will be returned. If no element has a matching attribute, a will be raised. For instance, consider this page source: The form element can be located like this:\n\nUse this when you know the attribute of an element. With this strategy, the first element with a matching attribute will be returned. If no element has a matching attribute, a will be raised. For instance, consider this page source: The username & password elements can be located like this: This will give the “Login” button as it occurs before the “Clear” button:\n\nXPath is the language used for locating nodes in an XML document. As HTML can be an implementation of XML (XHTML), Selenium users can leverage this powerful language to target elements in their web applications. XPath supports the simple methods of locating by id or name attributes and extends them by opening up all sorts of new possibilities such as locating the third checkbox on the page. One of the main reasons for using XPath is when you don’t have a suitable id or name attribute for the element you wish to locate. You can use XPath to either locate the element in absolute terms (not advised), or relative to an element that does have an id or name attribute. XPath locators can also be used to specify elements via attributes other than id and name. Absolute XPaths contain the location of all elements from the root (html) and as a result are likely to fail with only the slightest adjustment to the application. By finding a nearby element with an id or name attribute (ideally a parent element) you can locate your target element based on the relationship. This is much less likely to change and can make your tests more robust. For instance, consider this page source: The form elements can be located like this:\n• None Absolute path (would break if the HTML was changed only slightly)\n• None First form element in the HTML\n• None The form element with attribute set to The username element can be located like this:\n• None First form element with an input child element with set to\n• None First input child element of the form element with attribute set to\n• None First input element with attribute set to The “Clear” button element can be located like this:\n• None Input with attribute set to and attribute set to\n• None Fourth input child element of the form element with attribute set to These examples cover some basics, but in order to learn more, the following references are recommended: Here is a couple of very useful Add-ons that can assist in discovering the XPath of an element:\n• None xPath Finder - Plugin to get the elements xPath.\n\nUse this when you know the link text used within an anchor tag. With this strategy, the first element with the link text matching the provided value will be returned. If no element has a matching link text attribute, a will be raised. For instance, consider this page source: <html> <body> <p>Are you sure you want to do this?</p> <a href=\"continue.html\">Continue</a> <a href=\"cancel.html\">Cancel</a> </body> </html> The continue.html link can be located like this:\n\nUse this when you want to locate an element by tag name. With this strategy, the first element with the given tag name will be returned. If no element has a matching tag name, a will be raised. For instance, consider this page source: The heading (h1) element can be located like this:\n\nUse this when you want to locate an element by class name. With this strategy, the first element with the matching class name attribute will be returned. If no element has a matching class name attribute, a will be raised. For instance, consider this page source: The “p” element can be located like this:"

The Element Click command could not be completed because the element receiving the events is obscuring the element that was requested to be clicked. Thrown when an element is present in the DOM but interactions with that element will hit another element due to paint order. Thrown when trying to select an unselectable element. Thrown when an element is present on the DOM, but it is not visible, and so is not able to be interacted with. Most commonly encountered when trying to click or read text of an element that is hidden from view. Thrown when activating an IME engine has failed. Thrown when IME support is not available. This exception is thrown for every IME-related method call if IME support is not available on the machine. Navigation caused the user agent to hit a certificate warning, which is usually the result of an expired or invalid TLS certificate. The arguments passed to a command are either invalid or malformed. Thrown when attempting to add a cookie under a different domain than the current URL. The coordinates provided to an interaction’s operation are invalid. Thrown when a command could not be completed because the element is in an invalid state. This can be caused by attempting to clear an element that isn’t both editable and resettable. Thrown when the selector which is used to find an element does not return a WebElement. Currently this only happens when the selector is an xpath expression and it is either syntactically invalid (i.e. it is not a xpath expression) or the expression does not select WebElements (e.g. “count(//input)”). Occurs if the given session id is not in the list of active sessions, meaning the session either does not exist or that it’s not active. Thrown when frame or window target to be switched doesn’t exist. An error occurred while executing JavaScript supplied by the user. Thrown when the target provided to the move() method is invalid, i.e. out of document. Thrown when switching to no presented alert. This can be caused by calling an operation on the Alert() class when an alert is not yet on the screen. Thrown when the attribute of element could not be found. You may want to check if the attribute exists in the particular browser you are testing against. Some browsers may have different property names for the same property. (IE8’s .innerText vs. Firefox .textContent) No cookie matching the given path name was found amongst the associated cookies of the current browsing context’s active document. Raised when driver is not specified and cannot be located. Thrown when element could not be found. If you encounter this exception, you may want to check the following:\n• None Check your selector used in your find_by…\n• None Element may not yet be on the screen at the time of the find operation, (webpage is still loading) see selenium.webdriver.support.wait.WebDriverWait() for how to write a wait wrapper to wait for an element to appear. Thrown when frame target to be switched doesn’t exist. Thrown when trying to access the shadow root of an element when it does not have a shadow root attached. Thrown when window target to be switched doesn’t exist. To find the current set of active window handles, you can get a list of the active window handles in the following way: A new session could not be created. Thrown when a reference to an element is now “stale”. Stale means the element no longer appears on the DOM of the page. Possible causes of StaleElementReferenceException include, but not limited to:\n• None You are no longer on the same page, or the page may have refreshed since the element was located.\n• None The element may have been removed and re-added to the screen, since it was located. Such as an element being relocated. This can happen typically with a javascript framework when values are updated and the node is rebuilt.\n• None Element may have been inside an iframe or another context which was refreshed. Thrown when a command does not complete in enough time. Thrown when an unexpected alert has appeared. Usually raised when an unexpected modal is blocking the webdriver from executing commands. Thrown when a support class did not get an expected web element. The requested command matched a known URL but did not match any methods for that URL.\n\nABC’s allow custom implementations of Webdriver to be registered so that isinstance type checks will succeed.

        "document": "Understanding how to find elements with Selenium in Python is essential for anyone engaged in web automation and testing. Selenium, a powerful open-source tool, allows developers and testers to simulate user interactions with web applications, automating the testing process and ensuring that web applications function as expected (Selenium). One of the most crucial aspects of using Selenium effectively is mastering the various locator strategies available in Selenium Python. These strategies are pivotal for identifying and interacting with web elements, which are integral to executing automated test scripts successfully.\n\nThere are multiple strategies available for locating elements in Selenium Python, each with its own strengths and specific use cases. Commonly used methods include locating elements by ID, name, XPath, CSS Selector, class name, tag name, and link text. Each method has its own set of advantages and potential pitfalls. For instance, locating elements by ID is highly reliable due to the uniqueness of ID attributes on a webpage, whereas using XPath can be more flexible but potentially less efficient and more brittle.\n\nTo ensure reliability and maintainability of Selenium test scripts, it is important to prioritize unique and stable locators, avoid brittle locators, implement robust waiting strategies, and utilize design patterns such as the Page Object Model (POM). Additionally, understanding and addressing common challenges like handling dynamic content, dealing with stale elements, and navigating iframes and Shadow DOMs can significantly enhance the effectiveness of Selenium-based tests (Selenium documentation).\n\nThis guide delves into the detailed locator strategies, best practices, and common challenges associated with finding elements using Selenium Python. With code samples and thorough explanations, it aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of this critical aspect of web automation.\n\nUnderstanding locator strategies in Selenium Python is crucial for anyone looking to automate web testing effectively. Locator strategies help identify web elements on a webpage, and choosing the right one can make your test scripts more reliable and easier to maintain. In this guide, we will explore various locator strategies available in Selenium Python, along with examples and detailed explanations.\n\nOne of the most reliable and efficient ways to locate elements in Selenium Python is by using the method. This method locates the first element with the specified ID attribute, which is typically unique within a webpage. This makes it highly precise for identifying elements.\n• We first import the necessary Selenium modules.\n• Use the method with to locate the element with the specified ID.\n\nIf no element with the specified ID is found, Selenium will raise a .\n\nThe method locates the first element with the given name attribute. This strategy is particularly useful for form elements, as they often use the name attribute.\n• This method is especially helpful when dealing with input fields, radio buttons, or checkboxes in forms.\n• Similar to the ID method, it uses the for the updated syntax.\n• If multiple elements share the same name, only the first occurrence will be returned.\n\nXPath is a powerful locator strategy that allows navigation through the XML structure of a webpage. It can be used to locate elements based on their attributes, text content, or position in the DOM.\n• XPath can be particularly useful when dealing with complex DOM structures or when other locator strategies fail.\n• It allows for a variety of locating techniques such as by attributes, text, or element position.\n• Be cautious as XPath expressions can be more brittle and slower compared to other locator strategies.\n\nCSS Selectors provide a flexible and powerful way to locate elements based on their CSS properties. This method can combine multiple attributes and is often more concise than XPath.\n• CSS Selectors are generally faster than XPath and can be more readable.\n• They are particularly useful when dealing with complex page structures or when you need to locate elements based on multiple attributes or classes.\n\nThe method locates the first element with the specified class name. This can be useful when dealing with elements that share common styling or functionality.\n• This method is useful for elements that share common styles.\n• If multiple elements share the same class name, only the first occurrence will be returned.\n• Be cautious of dynamically generated classes as they can make your tests brittle.\n\nThe method locates elements based on their tag name.\n• This method is useful when you want to locate elements by their HTML tag.\n• It's especially handy for selecting all elements of a certain type, like all input fields or all divs.\n\nThe method locates links by their text content.\n• This method is useful for locating hyperlinks based on their visible text.\n• It helps to easily interact with links without needing to know their exact URL.\n\nSelenium Python offers a variety of locator strategies, each with its own strengths and use cases. The choice of strategy depends on the structure of the webpage, the uniqueness of the element, and the stability of the locator. It's often beneficial to use a combination of these strategies to create robust and maintainable test scripts. Always consider using explicit waits with these locator strategies to handle dynamic content and avoid synchronization issues.\n\nSelenium is a powerful tool for web automation that allows developers and testers to simulate user interactions with web applications. Effective element location strategies are crucial for reliable and maintainable Selenium test scripts. In this article, we will explore the best practices for locating elements in Selenium Python to ensure your tests are robust and efficient.\n\nWhen selecting locators for web elements, prioritize those that are unique and stable across different page loads and potential UI changes. This approach significantly enhances test reliability and reduces maintenance efforts.\n• None ID Attributes: IDs are typically the most reliable locators, as they are designed to be unique within a page. For example: IDs are guaranteed to be unique on the page by W3C standards, making them the preferred choice when available (LambdaTest).\n• None Name Attributes: While not as unique as IDs, name attributes are often stable and can be reliable for form elements:\n• None CSS Selectors: When IDs or names are not available, well-crafted CSS selectors can provide a balance of uniqueness and readability:\n• None XPath: While powerful, XPath should be used judiciously. Prefer relative XPaths over absolute paths to improve resilience to structural changes:\n\nCertain locator strategies can lead to fragile tests that break easily with minor UI changes. To mitigate this:\n• None Avoid Index-Based Selectors: Locators that rely on element order are prone to failure if the page structure changes. Instead of: Prefer more robust selectors that use element attributes or relationships:\n• None Minimize Dependence on Text Content: While sometimes necessary, text-based locators can be fragile if the content is dynamic or subject to change:\n• None Beware of Auto-Generated Values: Some frameworks generate dynamic IDs or class names. Avoid relying on these for locators:\n\nProper waiting mechanisms are crucial for reliable element location, especially in dynamic web applications. Implement explicit waits to ensure elements are in the expected state before interacting with them:\n• None Use Explicit Waits: Instead of relying on implicit waits or sleep statements, use explicit waits for better control and reliability:\n• None Custom Wait Conditions: For complex scenarios, implement custom wait conditions to ensure elements are truly ready for interaction:\n• None Combine Multiple Conditions: For elements that require multiple criteria to be met, combine expected conditions:\n\nThe Page Object Model is a design pattern that creates a separation between test code and locator strategies, improving maintainability and reusability of test scripts:\n• None Encapsulate Locators: Define locators within page object classes, not in test scripts:\n• None Use Methods for Element Interactions: Encapsulate element interactions within methods, making tests more readable and maintainable:\n• None Implement Chainable Methods: For more fluent test scripts, consider implementing chainable methods:\n\nAs web applications evolve, locator strategies may need to be updated. Implement practices to keep locators effective and maintainable:\n• None Periodic Audits: Regularly review locators to ensure they're still effective and haven't been affected by UI changes:\n• None Version Control for Locators: If using a centralized locator repository, use version control to track changes and rollback if necessary.\n• None Documentation: Maintain clear documentation for complex locators, explaining the rationale behind the chosen strategy:\n• None Automated Checks: Implement automated checks to validate locator effectiveness as part of the CI/CD pipeline, flagging potential issues before they affect production tests.\n\nBy adhering to these best practices, teams can significantly improve the reliability, maintainability, and effectiveness of their Selenium Python test suites. Regular review and refinement of locator strategies, combined with robust waiting mechanisms and well-structured page objects, form the foundation of resilient automated web testing.\n\nOne of the most frequent issues when using Selenium to locate elements is encountering . This occurs when Selenium cannot find the specified element on the page. Several factors can contribute to this problem:\n• Dynamic Content: Web pages with dynamically loaded content may not have elements immediately available when Selenium attempts to locate them.\n• Incorrect Locators: Using incorrect or outdated locators can lead to elements not being found.\n• Timing Issues: Attempting to interact with elements before the page has fully loaded.\n• None Implement Explicit Waits: Use in combination with expected conditions to wait for elements to be present or clickable before interacting with them. For example: This code waits up to 10 seconds for an element with the ID \"myElementId\" to be present on the page (Selenium documentation).\n• None Use Multiple Locator Strategies: If one locator method fails, try alternative strategies. For instance, if finding by ID doesn't work, attempt to locate the element by XPath or CSS selector.\n• None Verify Page State: Ensure the correct page has loaded before attempting to find elements. This can be done by checking for a known element that should be present on the target page.\n\noccurs when the element initially found is no longer attached to the DOM. This can happen due to page refreshes, JavaScript updates, or navigation to a new page.\n• None Re-locate Elements: Instead of storing element references, re-locate the element each time you need to interact with it.\n• None Implement Retry Logic: Create a custom function that attempts to interact with an element multiple times, re-locating it if a stale element exception occurs. For example:\n• None Use WebDriverWait with a Custom Expected Condition: Create a custom expected condition that handles stale element exceptions:\n\nElements within iframes or Shadow DOM structures can be challenging to locate as they are not directly accessible in the main document.\n• None Switch to the iframe: Before interacting with elements inside an iframe, switch the driver's context to the iframe:\n• None Use WebDriverWait to ensure the iframe is available:\n• None Use JavaScript Executor: Shadow DOM elements cannot be directly accessed using standard Selenium methods. Use JavaScript to pierce through the Shadow DOM:\n• None Utilize Shadow DOM-specific locators: Some browser drivers (like Chrome) support shadow DOM piercing with special locators:\n\nMany modern web applications use dynamically generated IDs or frequently changing attributes, making it challenging to create stable locators.\n• None Use Partial Matching: Utilize methods like contains() in XPath or attribute selectors in CSS to match parts of IDs or classes that remain consistent:\n• None Locate by Surrounding Elements: Use XPath to locate elements based on their relationship to more stable elements:\n• None Custom Attributes: Work with developers to add custom data attributes to important elements for testing purposes:\n\nAs web applications become more complex, finding elements efficiently and reliably can become challenging, especially when dealing with large DOM structures or slow-loading pages.\n• None Use Efficient Locators: Prioritize ID and name locators over XPath or CSS selectors when possible, as they are generally faster (Selenium best practices).\n• None Implement Page Object Model: Organize locators and page interactions into a Page Object Model to improve maintainability and reusability of code (Page Object Models).\n• None Optimize Wait Strategies: Use explicit waits with appropriate timeout values instead of implicit waits or sleep statements to balance between reliability and performance.\n• None Implement Caching: For elements that are frequently accessed and unlikely to change, implement a caching mechanism to store element references:\n• None Use Headless Mode: For scenarios that don't require visual rendering, use headless mode to improve performance:\n\nBy addressing these common challenges and implementing the suggested solutions, developers can significantly improve the reliability and efficiency of their Selenium-based element location strategies in Python. Regular updates to locators, collaboration with the development team, and staying informed about changes in web technologies will further enhance the robustness of automated testing and web scraping projects.\n\nRead more about Selenium best practices\n\nMastering element location strategies in Selenium Python is fundamental for creating robust, reliable, and efficient automated test scripts. By leveraging unique and stable locators, testers can minimize maintenance efforts and enhance the accuracy of their tests. Methods such as using IDs, names, CSS selectors, and XPath provide flexibility and strength in different scenarios. However, it is crucial to avoid brittle locators and dynamically generated attributes that can lead to fragile tests (LambdaTest).\n\nImplementing best practices such as explicit waits, the Page Object Model (POM), and regular review and refactoring of locators ensures that test scripts remain effective despite changes in the web application. Addressing challenges like element not found exceptions, stale element references, and handling of iframes and Shadow DOMs further fortifies the test automation process (Selenium documentation).\n\nBy adhering to these strategies and solutions, developers and testers can significantly enhance the performance and reliability of their Selenium-based tests, leading to more robust and maintainable web applications. Continuous improvement and staying informed about evolving web technologies are key to maintaining the effectiveness of automated testing frameworks."

        "document": "Python is the third most preferred programming language, according to StackOverflow Survey 2023. It is easy to learn, versatile, and has a large developer community. Python’s open-source nature, high-level syntax, and interpretive capabilities make it an ideal choice.\n\nWith frameworks like Flask and Django for backend development and libraries like Selenium for automation testing, Python offers comprehensive options. As software becomes more complex, manual testing is time-consuming. Python’s support for testing frameworks such as Unittest, pytest, Robot, Behave, and Lettuce makes it a popular choice for automation testing.\n\nThis article will review critical areas to help you run Python Selenium on Chrome for web automation. Firstly, we will start with an installation and setup process for Python and Selenium. Next, we will discuss handling various input types and interacting with warnings, alerts, and pop-ups. At the end of the article, you will be able to create tests for automation testing. If you are preparing for an interview you can learn more through Selenium interview questions.\n\nSelenium is a library that controls web browsers and automates tasks/tests. It provides a way to simulate user interaction with a web page, including filling out forms, clicking buttons/links, navigating through pages/windows, and taking screenshots of the window.\n\nSelenium WebDriver uses different WebDrivers, like ChromeDriver for Chrome, gecko driver for Firefox, and many others. It gives Selenium WebDriver the ability to control the browser.\n\nInstallation and setup process of ChromeDriver for different operating systems\n\nThere are multiple steps to be taken to install the driver correctly. Let’s look at each step one by one.\n• Check the version of Chrome installed on your device. To check the version, go to the top right corner, select the 3 dots icon -> settings, and then select About Chrome from the left panel.\n• Follow this ChromeDriver link to download it on your system.\n• If the version of your chrome browser is 115 or more, head towards the Chrome for testing availability dashboard.\n• Click on the stable channel and look for the OS configuration of your system.\n• Copy the URL and open it in a new tab, ChromeDriver will be downloaded in zip format. Extract it in the desired location.\n• If the version of your Chrome browser is less than 115, select the ChromeDriver according to the version of the Chrome browser. After that, we have to choose the operating system on which we desire to run it.\n• Once the download is complete, extract the chromedriver.exe by unzipping the folder.\n\nTill this point, the process is the same for all operating systems. Now we will see the setup process for each OS.\n• Copy the path for the file chromedriver.exe so I store the driver in “D:\\chromedriver.exe”.\n• Right-click on My Computer and click on Properties options.\n• You will be redirected to a new window that will look similar to the image below; after that, select the Advanced System Settings option.\n• From the system properties options, select the Environment Variables button.\n• Now, from the system variables, select the path and press the Edit button.\n• Paste the copied path of the file and save the changes by pressing the OK button.\n• Open the Finder and use ⌘+shift+G\n• Go to the following path “/usr/local/bin”\n\nIf you have already followed the steps to download ChromeDriver, skip steps 1, 2, and 3.\n• Go to your temp folder:\n\nIf you want to explore the way to set the environment variable for the driver using a terminal, follow the documentation by Selenium.\n\nHow to Check if the Installation is Successful\n\nOpen the command prompt and run the following command:\n\nIf the driver is installed correctly, it will open the chromedriver.exe program window.\n\nRun the following command in the terminal; if installed correctly, it will output the version of the driver.\n\nIn the year 2022, Selenium introduces Selenium Manager. It is a CLI (Command-Line Interface) program that was created in Rust programming language to support cross-platform execution. When no browser driver is found on the PATH or a third-party driver manager is not utilized, Selenium Manager is transparently triggered by the Selenium bindings. In Python, a module known as webdriver-manager is used to manage WebDriver binaries for multiple programming languages and browsers. It makes it easier to download and maintain the correct WebDriver executables that are needed for browser automation and to manage WebDriver binaries for browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, utilize this library.\n\nYou must first install the package before you can use webdriver-manager in your Python project. The Python package installer pip can be used to accomplish this by using the following command:\n\nOnce the module is installed you can use the webdriver-manager to initialize the ChromeDriver as shown in the below code:\n\nYou can also streamline your web automation tasks with Python Selenium on Chrome using AI-driven testing assistant like KaneAI.\n\nKaneAI is an end-to-end GenAI native test assistant that simplifies test creation, debugging, and evolution using natural language. Effortlessly create, debug, and evolve your tests using natural language, making test automation faster and more efficient.\n\nOpening a Website in Chrome Browser with the help of Python Selenium Script\n\nFor this guide, we will use VS Code.\n\nBefore moving forward, the following steps need to be done to run the Python scripts with ease.\n\nIt is not a mandatory step; However, if you want to use different versions of Python on your system for different projects, a virtual environment is a way to do it.\n\nLet’s discuss how to create an environment using different methods.\n\nFrom VS Code, you can create local environments using virtual environments(venv) or Anaconda(conda) by opening the Command Palette (Windows: Ctrl+Shift+P or macOS: ⇧+⌘+P), start typing the Python: Create Environment command to search and then select the command.\n\nIf you select Venv another menu will open to select the version of Python.\n\nAfter that, the environment folder will be created in your workspace, and a notification will display the creation progress in the bottom right corner.\n\nIf you choose to create a virtual environment using this method, use the following command (where .venv is the name of the environment folder):\n\nOnce the virtual environment (.venv) is created successfully, create a new Python file with the desired name.\n\nOpen a VS Code Terminal and run the following command to install Selenium. The version of Selenium used in this article is 4.9.1 . To know more about Selenium v4.\n\nThe required setup is completed. Let’s start with the rollercoaster ride of learning Python Selenium using Chrome.\n\nTo open a website on Chrome Browser, run the block of code:\n\nThe import statement is used to get webdriver from the selenium package.\n\nIt is used to initialize a new instance of the Chrome WebDriver.\n\nget(): This is a method provided by the WebDriver object, which is used to navigate to a specific URL. It instructs the web browser to open the specified URL.\n\nclose(): This method closes the current browser window or tab.\n\nIn this section, we will see how to control various actions such as navigating to web pages, clicking buttons, and filling out forms which are very commonly used by most websites. For this, we will use LambdaTest E-commerce to run our Selenium scripts.\n\nTo perform various actions, we need to locate the element. A key Selenium feature that enables you to locate web items on a page is the find_element method. This approach allows you to search for elements using various criteria, including an ID, name, class name, CSS selector, or XPath. During test execution, you can quickly recognize and interact with the desired elements by setting the proper locator strategy.\n\nSelenium WebDriver offers a range of methods to locate elements on a webpage, providing flexibility and versatility for web automation tasks. These methods enable developers to pinpoint specific elements based on various attributes. Some of the commonly used methods include finding elements by ID, NAME, or XPATH. Additionally, elements can be located by their LINK_TEXT or PARTIAL_LINK_TEXT. Other options include finding elements by their TAG_NAME, by CLASS_NAME, or by using CSS_SELECTOR. By leveraging these various methods, developers can effectively locate and interact with elements on webpages using Selenium with Python. The below table shows the syntax to use different methods.\n\nTo use By following import statement needs to be imported:\n\nTo get a form from the below HTML snippet:\n\nFollow the find_element method will be used:\n\nOther methods will work similarly to the ID method.\n\nAdding value to the input field\n\nIn automation, interacting with input fields is a regular task. Right-click anywhere on the webpage and choose inspect element to view the element’s details. Hover over the element you want to access. After utilizing the find_element function to identify the input element, you may imitate keyboard input by using the send_keys() method. You can simulate user input by filling the input field with the desired data by giving the desired text or value as an argument.\n\nThe below code shows how to use the method:\n\nThe below code is using element’s XPath to access it:\n\nButtons play an important role in web applications, from submitting a form to adding some functionalities, and testing their functionality is vital. For this task, we will use the Xpath to locate the element. To get the path of the element, right-click on the element and select copy from the available options; select copy Xpath(relative path of the element).\n\nThe code to store the element in a variable by XPath will look as below:\n\nSelect elements or dropdown menus are frequently found in web forms. Consider a situation where you need to control the dropdown menu. As shown below, we need to select Digital Music.\n\nTo use Dropdown get the XPath of the option you want to select. In the below code, a[3] is assigned to Laptops.\n\nAfter selecting the category below, the piece of code will add the text to the search field.\n\nThe below code will press the search button to trigger the search.\n\nTo know more about other methods, follow a detailed article for handling Dropdowns.\n\nAnother important action in Selenium test cases is clearing the text input or edit box’s contents. To clear the content/text of an edit box or text input, you can use the clear() method provided by the WebElement class.\n\nSelenium offers advanced techniques that let you manage many actions encountered while performing web testing and complex automation activities. This section will cover advanced Python Selenium techniques in Chrome, including drag-and-drop, moving through history and location, switching between windows and frames, handling popups and alarms, adding cookies, adding waits, and taking screenshots.\n\nThis functionality is commonly found in modern web apps. Selenium also provides this functionality to simulate drag-and-drop actions on web elements. By locating the source and the target element using the find_element method, you can use the drag_and_drop or drag_and_drop_by_offset methods to perform drag-and-drop operations, imitating user interactions and validating the expected behavior of the application.\n\nFor more detailed information on this topic, please refer to our comprehensive blog post on Drag and Drop.\n\nMost websites nowadays have various iframes and windows which are used to implement various features WebDriver also provides support moving between named windows using the “switch_to.window” method:\n\nMost websites have scroll to make it more interactive and engaging. The selenium scroll-down code is shown below. It calls the method execute_script() with the javascript to scroll to the end of the web page.\n\nHandling popups and alerts is paramount when automating web testing. Popups and alerts can appear during various scenarios, such as confirmation messages, error alerts, warnings, or authentication dialogs.\n\nTo delve deeper into this topic, we recommend referring to our comprehensive blog post covering Alert and Popup.\n\nSelenium enables you to control the browser’s location and navigate its history. To simulate user navigation behaviors, you can use Selenium WebDriver class methods like back(), forward(), and refresh(). You can test the behavior of web applications using these techniques to navigate to other pages, go back to the previous page, go forward to the next page, or refresh the current page.\n\nThe below code will showcase the usage of the methods:\n\nA cookie is a piece of data from a website stored within a web browser that the website can retrieve later. Web applications utilize cookies heavily to store session data and user preferences.\n\nFor adding cookies while running tests, Selenium offers several options. You can define the cookie’s name, value, domain, path, and other parameters using the add_cookie method, whereas the get_cookies() method is used to get the values of cookies. You may mimic personalized or logged-in user sessions by adding cookies, allowing for thorough testing of application operation. The cookies will be stored for a particular domain.\n\nTo learn more about this topic, we advise you to read our in-depth blog post about Handling Cookies.\n\nOne must incorporate waits in order to time test execution with the loading and rendering of the web page. You can tell Selenium to wait until a specific condition is met before moving on to the next phase by using explicit or implicit waits. This increases test stability and dependability by ensuring that the test case waits for particular items to be visible, clickable, or present.\n\nThere are two types of waits explicit and implicit.\n\nExplicit waits: This piece of code that you declare to wait until a specific event takes place before continuing on the website. The extreme case of this is time.sleep(), which sets the condition to an exact time period to wait.\n\nImplicit waits: It tells WebDriver to poll the DOM for a certain amount of time when trying to find any element (or elements) not immediately available. The default setting is 0.\n\nWe suggest reading our in-depth blog post on Types of waits to learn it in depth.\n\nIt is practical to take screenshots while a test execution for documentation, debugging, and reporting purposes. Selenium offers tools for taking screenshots of a web page whenever you want. You can save the screenshot to a particular location by employing the save_screenshot method. By taking screenshots, you may visually check the condition of the website and collect proof of test execution for subsequent investigation.\n\nThe below code will take a screenshot and open the code is implemented with it open a new window to show the preview of the screenshot.\n\nTo delve deeper into this topic, we recommend you to explore our extensive blog post covering the topic of Python Selenium Screenshots.\n\nChromeOptions class has been introduced in the latest/updated version of Selenium. It is helpful to make changes in the Chrome browser, whereas, DesiredCapabilities is an old concept (its usage in Java is deprecated.) to configure or make changes in the browser. Save this answer.\n\nIn Selenium 3, capabilities were defined in a session by using Desired Capabilities classes. As of Selenium 4, you must use the browser options classes. A browser options instance is required for remote driver sessions as it determines which browser will be used.\n\nThe page load strategy specifies how long the browser should wait before the page loads before continuing. Different page load techniques, including regular, eager, and none, are offered by Selenium. You can manage how Selenium interacts with the page while running the test by defining the preferred page load strategy in Chrome Options. By selecting the proper page load strategy, you may increase test stability by ensuring that your tests wait until all required items have loaded completely.\n• normal: Used by default, waits for all resources to download\n• eager: DOM access is ready, but other resources like images may still be loading\n• none: Any Does not block WebDriver at all\n\nThe below code will showcase how to incorporate eager technique to load the website.\n\nYou can use Chrome’s headless mode to run it without displaying the graphical user interface(GUI). It is helpful for reducing test execution time or conduct tests in a server environment. You can automate the web without a visible browser window by turning on the headless mode in Chrome Options. When performing tests on distant servers or in a continuous integration (CI) environment, headless mode is especially useful.\n\nProxy settings are essential for scenarios where you need to route network traffic through a proxy server. With Selenium, you may modify proxy settings by using Chrome Options. By specifying the proxy server’s address and port, you can route your browser’s requests through the proxy server during test execution. Applications that depend on certain network settings can be tested using this, and it can also be used to simulate various geographic locations.\n\nWith the help of a proxy within tests, we can verify if the website user interface matches the location.\n\nTips and tricks to improve the Chrome browsing experience for web automation\n\nHere are some tips and tricks to enhance the Chrome browsing experience for web automation:\n• Use Chrome Developer Tools: This tool helps to debug and inspect any website. To access it right-click on a web page and select Inspect or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+I or ⌥ Option + ⌘ Cmd + I. The Developer Tools allow you to analyze network traffic, manipulate the DOM, and test JavaScript code.\n• Employ User-Agent Switching: The User-Agent header identifies the operating system and browser being used. Depending on the user agent, some websites may act differently or restrict access to a particular functionality. You can change the user agent to imitate various devices or browsers to get around this.\n• Utilize Headless Mode: Chrome offers a headless mode, which allows you to run Chrome without a GUI(graphical user interface). It can be advantageous for automation since it reduces the usage of resources and allows you to execute tasks in the background.\n• Handle Page Load Delays: Asynchronous loading of web pages is common, and automation scripts must handle delays effectively. The “Network API,” the powerful API offered by Chrome’s Developer Tools, enables you to keep monitoring network traffic and wait for particular requests to finish before moving further. This might assist in coordinating your automation duties with the manner in which the website loads.\n• Clear Browser Data: To prevent interruption from past sessions when automating activities frequently, it’s crucial to delete browser data including cookies, cache, and local storage. By using the Chrome settings or programming tools for browser automation, you can manually delete this data.\n• Optimize Network Performance: One should take advantage of Chrome’s network-related features to enhance the execution of automation scripts. Using Chrome’s DevTools or automation libraries, you can, for instance, disable images and pointless resources, simulate slow network conditions, or deny particular requests.\n• Avoid Captchas and IP Blocking: To prevent automation, several websites use security measures like Captchas or IP blocking. You can utilize machine learning techniques or third-party captcha-solving services to bypass captchas. Using proxy servers or VPNs, you can rotate IP addresses for IP blocking.\n• Use Page Object Model (POM): By portraying web pages as objects, the Page Object Model design pattern aids in the organization and maintenance of automation code. Your automation scripts’ capacity to be reused, read, and maintained is enhanced. Your code will become more modular and easier to maintain if POM is implemented.\n• Implement Page Interactions: Interacting with site elements like buttons, forms, dropdown menus, etc. is common in automation. To find and interact with these items, Chrome automation frameworks like Puppeteer and Selenium WebDriver offer APIs. Your automation capabilities will be improved by effectively understanding and utilizing these APIs.\n• Stay Up-to-date: Regular upgrades and new features are introduced as Chrome continues to develop. Keep up with the most recent Chrome upgrades, which may include adjustments to the browser’s functionality, security improvements, and automation-related capabilities. This will enable you to take advantage of new functionality and modify your automation techniques as necessary.\n\nHow to Integrate Selenium with Python Testing Libraries\n\nPopular Python testing tools like Unittest and Pytest may be simply combined with Selenium to increase the functionality of your test automation system. In this guide, we will explore how to integrate Selenium with these testing libraries, providing a structured and efficient approach to writing and executing tests.\n\nThe base of the Python Unittest library is a third-party package called PyUnit. Based on the well-known JUnit framework, Steve Purcell came up with the idea for PyUnit. It later developed into a recognized Python module starting with version 2.5.\n\nFor a long time, Python’s standard library has included the unittest module. Therefore, installing it using something like pip install unittest is typically not necessary. It works without installation if you simply run import unittest in your Python code.\n\nTo get a better understanding and working of the unittest module we are going to run the following code:\n\nThe above code will run from top to bottom. Firstly, the set_up() method will initialize the driver and opens the mentioned URL. Then test_search_by_text_keyword() method will be executed where the search box will be selected and added value “iphone” and press the search button to search for the item. The test will be ended by closing the browser via tear_down() method.\n\nTo use the unittest module and write a simple test by inheriting the TestCase class, you’ll need to import the unittest module and define a class that inherits the TestCase class.\n\nThe test case’s entry point is a set_up() method. It can be used to perform a predetermined set of operations before running a single test or every test included in the class.\n\nSimilar to the set_up() method, test methods get implemented in the TestCase class.\n\nThe PyPy project gave rise to the Python testing framework Pytest. It can be used to create a variety of software tests, including functional, end-to-end, unit, and integration tests.\n\nYou must run the following command on the terminal (or command prompt), which makes use of the Python package management (pip), to install pytest:\n\nOnce the pytest module is installed successfully. We can run our test using pytest by the following code and name the file appropriately with the .py extension:\n\nTo run the Python pytest file use the following command:\n\nOnce the test is completed you get information regarding it in the terminal:\n\nCheck out our detailed blog on Pytest to gain deeper understanding.\n\nChallenges of Testing on the Local Grid\n\nTesting on a local grid might provide a variety of difficulties. The lack of readily available physical devices and browsers is one of the major problems. A local grid makes it challenging to test across a variety of device and browser configurations, which could have a negative effect on test coverage as a whole. It also needs a lot of resources, including infrastructure setup, software, and hardware, to maintain and manage. It can take time and money to scale the grid to handle rising test demand.\n\nIn order to address these issues, cloud-based testing grids are required. Cloud-based testing grids provide a large inventory of actual devices and browsers, making them scalable and adaptable solutions. Testers have access to a variety of setups and can run parallel tests, which speeds up test execution and improves test coverage. Because the testing environment is hosted on the infrastructure of the cloud provider, the cloud-based method eliminates the requirement for managing and maintaining local infrastructure.\n\nTo improve automated testing, a platform like LambdaTest provides cloud-based testing grids. Testers may easily perform Selenium tests in Python on a variety of Chrome browser versions across various operating systems by using LambdaTest. The platform enables testers to build and run automation scripts quickly by providing a seamless interface with well-known test frameworks like Pytest and Unittest.\n\nIn this section, we are going to run a test on LambdaTest using Pytest as the testing framework. We are going to run our test on WINDOWS 10 operating system with Chrome version 114.0.\n\nBefore Running a Python test on LambdaTest, follow a few simple steps:\n• Create an account on Lambdatest and complete all the required processes.\n• Go to the dashboard by clicking the dashboard button on the top right corner or Follow this LambdaTest Dashboard.\n• Get your credentials from the profile icon located in the top right corner, and then select the profile option it will redirect to the profile screen.

        "document": "New features are regularly added to web applications to boost user engagement. To ensure these updates work as intended and that the user interface remains functional, automated testing is crucial. Selenium is a widely-used tool for this type of automation testing.\n\nSelenium is an open-source automation testing tool that supports various scripting languages such as C#, Java, Perl, Ruby, JavaScript, and others. The choice of scripting language can be made based on the specific requirements of the application being tested.\n\nPython is one of the most popular choices when it comes to scripting with 51% of the developers using it, as suggested by the StackOverflow 2024 annual survey.\n\nWhy do Developers prefer Python for writing Selenium Test Scripts?\n\nDevelopers prefer Python for writing Selenium test scripts because of its simplicity, readability, and ease of use. Python’s clear and concise syntax allows for faster script development and easier maintenance, which is crucial in testing scenarios.\n\nAdditionally, Python has a rich set of libraries and frameworks that complement Selenium, making it easier to handle complex tasks such as data manipulation, reporting, and integration with other tools.\n\nPython’s extensive community support and documentation also provide valuable resources for troubleshooting and improving test scripts. These factors make Python a popular choice for Selenium automation.\n\nGetting started with Selenium using Python involves setting up an environment where you can write and run automated test scripts for web applications.\n\nSelenium, combined with Python, offers a powerful and easy-to-learn toolset for automating browser interactions. Python’s simple syntax makes it ideal for quickly writing clear and maintainable test scripts.\n\nTo begin, you’ll need to install the Selenium WebDriver, set up a compatible browser, and learn the basics of locating web elements, interacting with them, and running test cases. This combination is perfect for testing dynamic and responsive web applications efficiently.\n\nSelenium Python Example: How to run your first Test?\n\nTo run Selenium Python Tests here are the steps to follow:\n\nFirst, you’ll need to import the WebDriver and Keys classes from Selenium. These classes help you interact with a web browser and emulate keyboard actions.\n• webdriver: Allows you to control the browser.\n\nTo interact with a browser, you’ll need to create an instance of WebDriver. In this example, we use Chrome:\n\nMake sure chromedriver is in the same directory as your Python script. This command opens a new Chrome browser window.\n\nUse the .get() method to navigate to a website. This method waits for the page to load completely:\n\nThis will open Python’s official website in the browser.\n\nOnce the page is loaded, you can retrieve and print the page title to verify you’re on the right page:\n\nYou should see:\n\nTo perform a search, locate the search bar element, enter a query, and submit it. Here’s how to find the search bar by its name attribute and interact with it:\n• send_keys(“getting started with python”): Types the query into the search bar.\n\nAfter submitting the search query, you can check the updated URL to confirm the search results page:\n\nYou should see a URL similar to:\n\nFinally, close the browser session to end the test:\n\nHere is the complete script for your first Selenium test in Python. Save this code in a file named selenium_test.py and run it using python selenium_test.py:\n\nSelenium allows you to perform a variety of actions on web elements. You have already touched upon entering input, here’s how to interact with buttons, and dropdowns:\n\nAssuming you want to click a button with the ID “submit-button” after entering the input in the search bar :\n\nIf you need to click a link by its text:\n• find_element_by_id(“submit-button”): Finds the button with the ID “submit-button”.\n\nThough dropdowns are not present on this site, they are quite common for web application testing\n\nFor dropdown menus, Selenium provides the Select class to handle options within <select> elements.\n\nExample: Selecting an Option from a Dropdown\n\nAssuming you have a dropdown menu with the ID “dropdown-menu”:\n• select_by_visible_text(“Option 1”): Selects an option by its visible text.\n• select_by_value(“option1”): Selects an option by its value attribute.\n• select_by_index(0): Selects an option by its index in the dropdown.\n\nThe HTML Document Object Model (DOM) represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects. Selenium allows you to interact with these elements using various locator strategies.\n\nIn our first test script, we have already used some of the methods used to navigate DOM elements. This section will be a slightly more detailed view into how you can use different methods to locate and interact with elements on the Python.org website.\n\nTo click the “Downloads” link, you can use the .find_element_by_link_text() method, but here’s how to use other locators to achieve the same, example by using find_element_by_xpath:\n\nlocates the “Downloads” link based on its visible text.\n\nTo access the main header text, you can use different locators to find the header element.\n• Class Name: “introduction” is used to find the header element based on its class.\n\nExample: Filling Out and Submitting the Search Form\n\nTo interact with the search form, you can use the .find_element_by_name() method to locate the input field.\n• Name Attribute: find_element_by_name(“q”) locates the search input field by its name attribute.\n\nWhen working with multiple browser windows or tabs, or dealing with iframes (frames), you may need to switch contexts to interact with different elements.\n• window_handles: Retrieves a list of window handles. Switch to a specific window using switch_to.window().\n\nExample: Switching to an iFrame\n\nTo switch to and interact with elements within an iframe:\n\nDynamic content can load at different times, so using waits helps ensure elements are present before interacting with them.\n• implicitly_wait(): Sets a default wait time for finding elements. If an element is not immediately found, WebDriver will wait up to the specified time.\n• WebDriverWait(driver, 10): Creates an instance of WebDriverWait, specifying a maximum wait time of 10 seconds.\n• wait.until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.NAME, “q”))): Pauses the script until the search bar element is found by its name attribute. If the element is not found within 10 seconds, a TimeoutException will be raised.\n\nTo ensure that the application behaves as expected, you can use assertions and validations.\n• Assertions: Used to check if the conditions are met. For example, checking if the title or text of elements matches expected values.\n• assert: Verifies conditions and will raise an AssertionError if the condition is not true.\n\nWeb applications often use JavaScript alerts, confirmation dialogs, or prompts to interact with users. Selenium provides ways to handle these pop-ups effectively.\n\nJavaScript alerts are simple pop-up messages that require user interaction to dismiss. Selenium allows you to interact with these alerts using the switch_to.alert() method.\n• switch_to.alert: Switches the context to the alert. Once switched, you can interact with the alert.\n• alert.accept(): Accepts the alert, which is equivalent to clicking “OK” on the alert.\n\nProperly closing the browser session is crucial for releasing resources and ensuring that your automation script runs cleanly.\n• driver.quit(): Closes all browser windows and ends the WebDriver session. This is the preferred method for cleanup as it ensures the browser process is terminated and resources are freed.\n• driver.close(): Closes the current window. If it’s the only window open, it will end the session. Use driver.quit() for complete cleanup.\n\nIntegrating Selenium tests with a testing framework provides structured test cases, reporting, and additional functionality such as setup and teardown methods.\n\nunittest is a built-in Python testing framework that provides a structured approach to writing and running tests, including test case management, fixtures, and test discovery. Integrating Selenium with unittest allows for organized test cases, setup and teardown methods, and detailed test reports, making it easier to manage and maintain automated tests.\n• unittest.TestCase: Defines a test case class. Each method within the class represents a test case.\n• setUpClass(): Initializes resources needed for the tests. Runs once before any test methods are executed.\n• tearDownClass(): Cleans up resources. Runs once after all test methods have completed.\n• unittest.main(): Runs the tests and provides output in the console.\n\npytest is a powerful and flexible Python testing framework that simplifies writing tests with its rich feature set, including fixtures, parameterized tests, and detailed assertions. Integrating Selenium with pytest enhances test organization, facilitates advanced setup/teardown functionality, and generates comprehensive test reports, improving test reliability and clarity.\n• pytest.fixture(): Defines a fixture that sets up and tears down resources. The scope=”module” ensures the fixture is run once per module.\n• yield: Provides the driver instance to the test function and performs cleanup after the test completes.\n• assert: Checks that the condition is met. pytest will report the assertion failure if the\n• How to install GeckoDriver for Selenium Python?\n• How to perform Web Scraping using Selenium and Python\n• How to Create and Use Action Class in Selenium Python\n• How to download a file using Selenium and Python\n• How to Press Enter without Element in Selenium Python?\n• Get Current URL in Selenium using Python: Tutorial\n\nBest Practices using Selenium WebDriver with Python\n\nHere are five best practices for using Selenium WebDriver with Python:\n• Use Explicit Waits: Prefer explicit waits over implicit waits to handle dynamic content. Explicit waits ensure that your script interacts with elements only when they are ready, reducing the chances of encountering timing issues.\n• Organize Tests with Frameworks: Integrate Selenium tests with testing frameworks like unittest or pytest to structure your test cases, manage setup and teardown, and generate detailed test reports.\n• Use Page Object Model (POM): Implement the Page Object Model to separate test logic from page-specific code. This design pattern promotes code reusability, maintainability, and easier updates.\n• Handle Exceptions Carefully: Implement error handling and logging to manage unexpected situations, such as element not found or timeout errors. This helps in debugging and provides insights into test failures.\n• Optimize Browser Performance: Run tests in headless mode or use browser profiles to speed up test execution and reduce resource consumption. Also, ensure that browser drivers are up-to-date for compatibility and performance improvements.\n\nRunning Selenium Python tests on BrowserStack’s Real Device Cloud offers numerous advantages that significantly enhance testing efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nBrowserStack provides access to a wide range of real devices and browsers, ensuring that tests reflect real-world scenarios and uncover device-specific issues. The platform supports scalable parallel execution, allowing multiple tests to run simultaneously across various configurations, which accelerates the development cycle.\n\nCross-platform testing on BrowserStack ensures consistent application performance across different environments. Additionally, it offers real-time debugging features such as live logs, screenshots, and video recordings, which aid in quick troubleshooting.\n\nSeamless integration with CI/CD pipelines further automates the testing process, enabling tests to run on every code change and providing immediate feedback on application quality. Overall, BrowserStack Automate enables comprehensive, efficient, and reliable testing, fostering continuous development and deployment."

        "document": "During the course of my career in automation testing with Selenium, I have come across many folks who have complaints about the stability and reliability of their automation tests. In most cases, the logic used in the implementation of test scenarios was spot-on, but the design and scalability were a matter of concern. This is a common sight for anyone who has sailed through the waters of Selenium test automation.\n\nAfter years of working with the Selenium framework, I have realized that the ‘One size fits all’ approach does not apply to test automation. Though there are no thumb rules for the design and development of scalable automation tests, there are certain principles that you must follow when writing tests using the Selenium framework. The principles can also be termed ‘Selenium best practices’.\n\nIn this blog post, we discuss the top 16 Selenium best practices for Selenium test automation which might help you develop well-designed and scalable test suites(or test cases). If you are preparing for an interview you can learn more through Selenium interview questions.\n\nThe majority of Selenium best practices covered in the blog post that follows are independent of the programming language used to automate Selenium tests. These Selenium best practices are useful regardless of the language you select for automation testing. Observe these 16 Selenium best practices for effective test automation.\n\nIt is widely known that the behavior of web applications (or websites) depends on many external factors such as network speed, device (or machine) capabilities, access location, load on the back-end server, and more. These factors make it quite challenging to predict the actual time taken to load a specific web element. Here, adding a delay (or timeout) before performing any actions on the web element will delay the execution while allowing the particular web element to load.\n\nDelay achieved using a blocking sleep call (e.g., Thread.sleep in Java, time.sleep in Python) blocks the test thread for the specified number of seconds. For a single-threaded application, it will block the thread and effectively the process as well. Blocking sleep calls are instrumental in adding the required delay, but the duration of delay depends on numerous factors. There is no guarantee that the delay being added will work all the time. For example, if you have added a delay of 5 seconds, the specified web element does not load even after 10 seconds.\n\nIn the code snippet (in Python) shown above, after the test URL is loaded, a blocking sleep of 5 seconds has been added. What if the web elements on the page are successfully loaded within milliseconds? The subsequent delay of 5 seconds not only elongates the duration of the test cycle but may also cause stability issues with the UI automation tests.\n\nImagine the amount of delay if the above test snippet has to be executed 5000 times (on different web browsers)!\n\nWhat is the potential alternative to blocking sleep calls? Selenium provides Implicit wait and Explicit wait that handle delays more efficiently than sleep. Implicit wait informs the browser to wait for a specified time duration for all the web elements present on the page. If the element is available faster than the implicit delay time, the execution moves to the next line of code execution. For example, if an implicit wait of 10 seconds is added for a specified element but the element loads in 3 seconds, the script does not wait for the remaining 7 seconds.\n\nOn the other hand, the explicit wait is another type of dynamic Selenium wait that is used to stop the script execution on a particular condition for a specified duration. WebDriverWait and ExpectedConditions can be used to achieve condition-based waits.\n\nIn the code snippet shown below, we wait for the web element (with linktext as SITEMAP) to appear on the page. If the web element is not present, an exception is thrown.\n\nRefer to Selenium Waits: Implicit, Explicit, Fluent, And Sleep for more information on Implicit and Explicit waits.\n\nWhen working in a team, there are cases where your team members may be required to enhance the tests that you had written. If you revisit the same test after a couple of months, you might not be able to figure out the purpose of a test, until you go through the complete implementation.\n\nIf some tests have failed during the execution stage, it should be easy to figure out which functionalities are broken by just taking a quick look at the test name. These problems can be easily fixed by giving naming test cases in a manner that they are self-explanatory so that neither you nor your teammates spend time unnecessarily scrolling through the implementation.\n\nSometimes during the Selenium test automation process, you may notice that the test implementation is not working correctly on specific browsers. This is typically the case when performing cross browser testing on outdated browsers like Internet Explorer.\n\nDoes testing your website on Internet Explorer still make sense? to learn more about it follow this guide on\n\n browser testing On Internet Explorer.\n\nIrrespective of the web browser on which automation testing with Selenium is performed, setting the browser zoom level to 100 percent is one of the Selenium best practices that should be followed. This setting gives a native mouse feel and ensures that the native mouse events are set to the correct coordinates.\n\nAlong with this setting, Protected Mode Settings (in Internet Explorer) for each zone must be the same else you may end up getting a NoSuchWindowException exception.\n\nOne of the first actions performed by a tester for Selenium test automation is taking the web page’s screenshot. Screenshots are taken during testing the process to help developers in debugging issues and help key stakeholders track product development progress. Screenshots also help detect whether test failure is due to application failure or problem in the test script being used for automation testing with Selenium.\n\nBy default, Selenium does not open the browser window in the maximized mode. This can affect the screenshot (or snapshot) of the web page that is typically attached in test reports. Maximizing the browser window immediately after the test URL is loaded ensures that a screenshot of the entire web page is captured.\n\nThis is one of the Selenium best practices that should be followed irrespective of the browser on which Selenium test automation is performed. We have a detailed hub on using Selenium WebDriver for full-page screenshots, if you’d like to dig deeper.\n\nOne of the challenges with Selenium test automation is that automation tests have to be modified if there are changes in the implementation related to locators used in the test code. ID, Name, Link text, XPath, CSS Selector, DOM Locator, etc. are some of the frequently used web locators in Selenium WebDriver.\n\nWith so many web locators, it is necessary to choose the right one to minimize the impact on tests caused due to changes in the user interface. Link Text is usually preferred if there is a dynamic situation.ID, Class, and Name are not only the easiest to use but also less brittle than other web locators.\n\n\n\nThere are situations where the only option left is XPath. XPath engines might vary from one browser to another. Hence, there is no guarantee that XPath for one browser would work seamlessly for another browser. A browser like Internet Explorer does not have a native XPath engine for locating web elements. Hence, JavaScript XPath Query Engine usually is used for finding elements by XPath in IE. This will be slower than the native XPath engine. XPath is more brittle as reordering elements in a page or introducing a new web element can cause the existing implementation with XPath to fail. If XPath is the only option, you should use Relative XPath instead of Absolute XPath, more about XPath can be found at this guide for using XPath In Selenium.\n\nFor testing internationalized applications, we might not be able to use LinkText or partialLinkText if the anchor tags do not contain any ID or class. For localization or internationalization testing, partial href should be used so that even if the language on the site changes, the href link still points to the same location.\n\nThe ideal web selector order is: id > Name > CSSSelector > XPath. Here is an interesting thread on StackOverflow with an insightful discussion on performance aspects of popular web Selenium locators for automation testing with Selenium.\n\nCross browser testing is a challenging task as you need to prioritize testing on different browser + OS combinations. If we include browsers and their browser versions, it would add up to a vast number. Formalizing a list of (browser + OS + device) combinations is of prime importance as it would help in prioritizing the combinations that have to be taken up for cross browser testing. This formalized list is also called Browser Matrix or Browser Compatibility Matrix.\n\nBrowser Matrix is vital information drawn from product analytics, geolocation, and other detailed insights about audience usage patterns, stats counter, and competitor analysis. Browser Matrix will help cover all the relevant browsers (that matter to your product), thereby reducing the development and testing efforts. A sample Browser Compatibility Matrix is below:\n\nThe template for creating a Browser matrix is available in the following location.\n\nIf a particular test in an extensive test suite fails, it can become challenging to locate the failing test case. Logging can be a huge savior in such cases as console logs at appropriate places in the test code help develop a better understanding of the code and help in zeroing on the problem.\n\nSome of the popular log levels (available in popular programming languages) debug, info, warning, error, and critical. Adding unnecessary logs in the test implementation can cause delays in the test execution. Hence, it is recommended to add logs with level error (and/or critical) in scenarios that aid in tracking the cause of failure.\n\nAlong with logging, reporting is an integral part of Selenium test automation as it helps in determining the status (pass/fail) of the tests. This is where automation test reports can play a huge role as it helps in keeping track of the progression of test suites (or test cases) and corresponding test results. Reports also help minimize the time required for the maintenance of test data due to improvement in the readability of the test output.\n\nAnalyzing features and accessing test coverage becomes easy with automation test reports.\n\nSelenium test automation without logging and reporting defeats the sole purpose of using the Selenium framework. That is why logging and reporting are considered one of the best Selenium test practices in automation.\n\nWhen writing Selenium test automation scripts, you must keep a check on its maintainability and scalability. This is possible if changes in the web page UI requires minimal (or no) changes in the test script. Suppose the scripts are not appropriately maintained, i.e. different scripts using the same web element. In that case, whenever there is a change in the web element, corresponding changes must be made at multiple places in the test script.\n\nThis is where Page Objects, a popular web UI automation pattern, comes handy as it enhances test maintenance and reduces code duplication. In-Page Object Model (POM), a centralized object repository is created for controls on a web page. The web page is implemented as a separate class. Hence, every web page being tested will have its corresponding page object class.\n\nThis eases code maintenance as Selenium automation scripts do not directly interact with the page’s web elements. Instead, a new layer (page class/page object) resides between the test code and controls on the web page.\n\nAlong with better maintainability, using POM in automation testing with Selenium helps in reducing the code size as page object methods defined in different page classes can be reused across multiple Selenium test automation scripts.\n\nLeveraging Page Object Model is one of the Selenium best practices that can aid in:\n• Minimizing code changes due to updates in product UI\n• Simplifying the visualization and model of the web page under test\n\nShown below is a sample directory structure for using Page Objects in a Selenium test automation project.\n\nWe have already covered Page Object Model Tutorial with Java and Page‌ ‌Object‌ ‌Model‌ Tutorial With‌ C# earlier.\n\nBehavior Driven Development, popularly called BDD, is a popular development approach that helps in writing test cases in plain English language (called Gherkin). This means that along with developers and testers, members with minimal (or no) technical know-how can participate in the development of tests.\n\nBDD frameworks help in filling the void between business people and technical people as all of them get the opportunity to work on the enhancement of the tests. Gherkin files created for BDD testing consist of a combination of features, steps, and scenarios, along with relevant Gherkin keywords such as Given, When, Then, etc. The format of feature files and keywords being used is uniform irrespective of the BDD framework being used. This makes it easier to shift from one BDD framework to another as the learning curve is very low.\n\nAs business and technical people are on the same page, it helps in improving the product quality as tests are based on technical and business recommendations. BDD tests are more usable when compared to TDD tests as changes in business specification or feature specification would involve minimal changes in corresponding BDD features and scenarios. When compared to TDD (Test Driven Development), BDD tests have an improved shelf-life as tests are created using business and feature specifications. It is one of the most essential Selenium best practices out there. Some of the popular BDD frameworks are Cucumber, Behave, SpecFlow, etc. Shown below is a sample feature file that searches for LambdaTest on DuckDuckGo:\n\nWe have covered Business-Driven Development with Gherkin and Behave BDD framework earlier, if you’d like to explore this section more.\n\nWhen working on tests that use the Selenium framework, it is essential to focus on the test code’s maintainability. A standard project can consist of Src and Test folders. The Src folder can contain sub-directories that contain Page Objects, Helper functions, and file(s) that contain web locator information used in test scenarios. The Test folder can include the actual test implementation.\n\nWe don’t have a standard rule when it comes to a directory structure for Selenium test automation. However, Selenium best practices recommend us to have a directory structure that separates the test implementation from the test automation framework. This helps in better organization of the test code.\n\nA website (or web application) should be tested against different combinations of browsers, devices, and OS combinations (i.e., multiple datasets). Hard coding of test values in test automation scripts is not a scalable solution as it would lead to unnecessary bloatware and possible repetition of test code.\n\nA better solution is using parameterization for achieving data-driven automation testing with Selenium. Parameterization helps in executing test cases against different input combinations (or data sets). More extensive the data set, the better is the test coverage. This, in turn, helps in improving product quality and implementing good Selenium test practices.\n\nWe have covered the following topics on data-driven testing with Selenium test automation:\n\n12. Do Not Use a Single Driver Implementation\n\nWebDrivers in Selenium are not interchangeable. The situation of executing automated cross browser tests on a local machine is entirely different from being executed on a continuous build server. In that environment, it will be wrong to assume that the next test will use Firefox WebDriver (or Chrome WebDriver or any other WebDriver).\n\nWhen integration tests are executed are in a continuous build environment, the test will only receive a RemoteDriver (i.e., WebDriver for any target browser). Amongst all Selenium best practices, it is recommended to use Parameter notes to manage different browser types and get the code ready for simultaneous execution (or parallel testing). Small frameworks can be created in Selenium using LabelledParameterized (@Parameters in TestNG and @RunWith in JUnit).\n\nThis practice will be useful in ensuring that the implementation is flexible enough to work with different browser types.\n\n13. Come Up with Autonomous Test Case Design\n\nThe automation test design solely depends on the goal that you are planning to achieve from the test. Things can get complicated when the test suite consists of several tests. One of the most critical Selenium best practices is to avoid inter-dependency between different tests in a test suite and separating the specification of what the test is supposed to do from the test execution strategy.\n\nThe other major advantage of using autonomous tests is you can explore parallelism to expedite the test execution. If tests are dependent, the outcome of one test also affects the second test. Hence they cannot be executed in parallel as they are largely interconnected. You could make use of relevant decorators & markers (e.g., @pytest.mark.incremental decorator, xfail marker in PyTest) in case you still cannot avoid having dependency between tests and want to skip execution of a test if its dependent test has failed.\n\nHowever, it is recommended to come up with autonomous tests (whenever possible). Otherwise, you might miss the opportunities to leverage Selenium (and test framework) that can do wonders to the test execution!\n\n14. Use Assert and Verify in Appropriate Scenarios\n\nThere are numerous cases in automation testing with Selenium, where you would want to halt the test execution on encountering a hard error. For example, you are using Selenium to automate testing of the Gmail login page, but the web locator being used for locating the sign-in box is not correct. In this case, assert should be issued as the remaining tests will falter out as they are dependent on the sign-in page.\n\nAsserts should only be used when you want to halt the test execution in case of a hard failure (like the one mentioned above). If the assert condition is false, execution stops, and further tests will not be executed. On the other hand, Verify should be used where the criticality of the error is low, and you still want to proceed with test execution irrespective of the status of Verify condition.\n\nYou might find JUnit Asserts With Examples useful.\n\nOne of the most common Selenium best practices for Selenium test automation is avoiding unnecessary duplication of code. You might be using different web locators such as XPath, ID, etc. for accessing the web elements present on the web page. The code that is frequently used in the implementation should be created as a separate API, so that code duplication is minimal.\n\nAvoiding duplication also helps in the reduction of code size and improves the maintainability of the test code. Wrapping Selenium calls is one of the Selenium best practices that can significantly impact maintaining a complex test suite (or test code).\n\nA primary factor for Selenium’s popularity is its support for parallel testing. Almost all popular test frameworks such as PyTest, PyUnit, TestNG, Cucumber, etc. provide features for executing tests in parallel on a Selenium Grid.\n\nParallel testingin Selenium lets you execute the same tests simultaneously on different environments (i.e., a combination of browsers, platforms, and device emulators). Using Selenium, it is recommended to enable parallel testing in the implementation as it reduces the test execution time by a significant margin.\n\nDevelopers and testers can use a cloud-based Selenium Grid like LambdaTest. LambdaTest is an AI-powered test orchestration and execution platform that lets you run manual and automated tests at scale with over 3000+ real devices , browsers and OS combinations.\n\nThe platform supports all popular test frameworks, it also helps in integrating various project management, bug tracking tools and CI/CD tools integration seamlessly.\n\nThe Grid can be further leveraged to improve the performance of parallel tests as execution is performed on a highly scalable and reliable Selenium Grid.\n\nBonus Tip – Now that we have looked at the top 16 Selenium best practices, it is time, we also deep dive into some of the worst Selenium practices that should be avoided when performing automation testing with Selenium!\n\nIn the section above, I listed down the most essential Selenium best practices to assist you in automation testing with Selenium. Now, I present some of the Selenium practices that you should avoid at any cost:\n\nDownloading a file on any web platform is initiated by clicking on a link (or a button) that prompts users to download the file. The same operation can be automated using Selenium, but the downside is that API does not show any progress regarding the file download. Hence, you would not be aware of whether the download functionality is being tested or not.\n\nDo you know how to upload and download a file in Selenium? Watch this video to learn how to upload and download files in Selenium WebDriver using different techniques.\n\nSubscribe to the LambdaTest YouTube Channel and stay updated with the latest tutorials around Selenium testing, Cypress testing, and more.\n\nMoreover, downloading files is not an essential aspect of testing user interaction with the web platform. Instead, the download link located using Selenium (and any required cookies) should be passed to an HTTP request library like libcurl.\n\nCAPTCHA or ‘Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart’ is specifically designed to check whether a human is performing the necessary operation. In short, it is designed to prevent automation.\n\nDisabling CAPTCHAS in the test environment and adding a hook for bypassing the CAPTCHA are the two strategies that can be used for getting around CAPTCHA checks in the test environment.\n\nCaptcha has always been tricky for testers to automate here a video for you to understand it better.\n\nTwo-factor authentication (2FA) is a security mechanism where an OTP (One-Time Password) is generated using Authenticator mobile apps. Gmail has an authenticator app that will make random codes to authenticate whether the actual account holder is trying to login to a new system (or app).\n\nAutomating 2FA in Selenium can be a considerable challenge, and it might not guarantee performance. It is better to avoid automating 2FA in test environments. You also have the option of disabling 2FA for a specific set of users to use their credentials (on any test system). Alternatively, you can also configure test machines so that 2FA is disabled for a certain family of IP addresses (or selected IP addresses).\n\nWeb crawling (or spidering) is performed using a web crawler, which is an automated script for browsing the Internet in a systematic and automated manner. Selenium is not designed to spider links, as it requires time to startup, and traversal through the DOM might take a few seconds (or even minutes).\n\nAs the time taken is variable, Selenium should never be used for spidering. Instead, use curl commands or libraries such as BeautifulSoup for crawling the web.\n\n5. Automation of Logins on Gmail, Facebook, & other Related Platforms\n\nUsing automation (with Selenium or other test frameworks) for logging in to Gmail, Facebook, or any such websites is against their policies. Secondly, the testing can be highly unreliable.\n\nInstead, the developer can use the third-party APIs provided by the corresponding website as it is more reliable, less subject to change, and more secure to use. Using Selenium automation for login purposes (on these websites) should be avoided at any cost.\n\nParallelism is an integral part of cross browser testing (and Selenium automation testing) as it aids in expediting the test execution. However, the execution sequence is not guaranteed.\n\nThe development of inter-dependent tests should be completely avoided as it is a bad practice and does not guarantee reliability. The test suite might pass in one test execution, whereas the same test suite can fail in the next cycle. The practice of autonomous test case design should be followed when coming up with Selenium automation test cases (or test suites).\n\nSelenium framework is designed for automation testing. Performance testing using Selenium and WebDriver is not recommended, as it is not optimized for doing that task and you might not get the expected results.\n\nOn a website (or a web platform), there are many external factors such as browser startup speed, the speed at which HTTP server response is received, etc. that are beyond the tester’s control. Rather than choosing Selenium WebDriver for performance testing, you should select ready-made tools that are specifically designed for performance testing.\n\nIn this detailed article, we looked at some of the Selenium best practices and selected worst practices for automation testing with Selenium. When coming up with Selenium test scenarios, you should always remember that Selenium is ideal for automation testing, so do not use the same for other types of testing since it might read favorable results. With LambdaTest, you can perform automated testing with Selenium for 3000+ browser and operating systems.\n\nIf you come across some more Selenium best practices or poor practices, do add the details in the comments section, and we would append the same to the article."

It allows developers and testers to automate browser actions, interact with web elements, and perform various tasks, making it an essential tool for web automation. In this tutorial, we will explore Selenium with Python, a popular programming language for test automation, and provide a step-by-step guide to getting started with Selenium using Python.\n\nNot only does Selenium offer a wide range of functionalities for web automation, but it also boasts a vibrant ecosystem of frameworks and libraries that further enhance the testing experience. Some of the renowned Selenium Python frameworks are: PyTest, Robot Framework and Behave.

Save the above code in a Python file (e.g., first_script.py) and execute it. It will open the website, validate the title, and print whether the title validation was successful or not. Finally, it will close the browser.\n\nFeel free to explore more Selenium capabilities and perform additional actions on the website, such as interacting with elements, submitting forms, or navigating to different pages.\n\nIdentifying web elements using appropriate locators is crucial when working with Selenium and Python. While various methods such as ID, Name, Class Name, Link Text, and CSS Selector are effective, it is advisable to prioritise ID and Name over XPath when they are available. Additionally, developers can leverage browser developer tools to assist in identifying elements accurately.\n\nUse these locator methods in your Selenium scripts to locate web elements based on the specific attributes or criteria of the elements you are targeting on your webpage.\n\nInteracting with web elements is a crucial aspect when working with Selenium and Python. It allows us to perform various actions in our test scripts. In this section, we will explore essential operations such as clicking elements, entering values into text boxes, handling alerts, pop-ups, dropdowns, and more. Mastering these interactions is fundamental for building effective and comprehensive test scripts with Selenium and Python.\n\nHere are examples of different interactions with web elements using Selenium with Python:\n\nRemember to import the necessary modules/classes and replace the element locators (“element-id”, “button-id”, etc.) with appropriate locators based on the HTML structure of your webpage.\n\nThese examples cover some common interactions with web elements using Selenium with Python. Feel free to modify them based on your specific requirements and the structure of the website you are automating.\n\nThis section will provide an in-depth exploration of advanced interactions commonly used in web UI automation with Selenium and Python. We will focus on three significant interactions: Mouse Actions (Drag and Drop, Double Click), Keyboard Actions (Keys, Combining Keys), and Handling Frames and Windows. By mastering these advanced interactions, you will be equipped with essential skills to efficiently automate web applications using Selenium and Python.\n\nHere are examples of advanced interactions using Selenium with Python:\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to perform mouse actions like drag and drop and double-click using ActionChains, send keys to web elements, and handle frames and windows using Selenium with Python. Remember to import the necessary modules (ActionChains and Keys) and adapt the code to match the specific elements and actions required in your automation scenario.\n\nBy leveraging the power of Selenium and Python, you now have the ability to automate browser actions, validate web elements, interact with forms, handle alerts and pop-ups, and perform complex testing scenarios. Additionally, we explored advanced interactions like mouse actions, keyboard actions, and managing frames and windows, empowering you to tackle a wide range of web automation challenges.\n\nIn the next series on this blog, we will deep dive into handling waits, taking screenshots, handling exceptions, and integrating with popular test frameworks. Remember, Selenium with Python offers a vast array of possibilities for web testing and automation. As you continue your journey, don’t hesitate to explore additional features, experiment with different locators, and adopt best practices to enhance your test scripts. Stay tuned for more in-depth tutorials that will enhance your skills and enable you to build robust and sophisticated automation solutions."

        "document": "After upgrading to Chrome version 115.x, my automation stopped working, and chrome driver versions were no longer released, because from chrome version 115.x, automations are performed by CFT (chrome for test ), which as I understand this browser remains static until user action, preventing automations from stopping due to automatic chrome updates and need for crhome driver replacement. The problem was solved with the solution below:\n\nAs of today, the files can be downloaded from: https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/\n\nPrefer the stable version and download the compatible browser and chromedriver.\n\nThe rest of the code continues to work."
