        "document": "In this tutorial we will learn how servo motors work and how to control servo motors with Arduino. Servo motors are very popular and widely used in many Arduino projects because they are easy to use and provide great position control.\n\nServos are great choice for robotics projects, automation, RC models and so on. I have already used them in many of my Arduino projects and you can check out some of them here:\n• SCARA Robot | How To Build Your Own Arduino Based Robot\n\nYou can watch the following video or read the written tutorial below. It includes several examples how to use a servo motor with Arduino, wiring diagram and codes. In additional, it has a guide how to control multiple servo motors with Arduino using the PCA9685 PWM driver.\n\nA servo motor is a closed-loop system that uses position feedback to control its motion and final position. There are many types of servo motors and their main feature is the ability to precisely control the position of their shaft.\n\nIn industrial type servo motors the position feedback sensor is usually a high precision encoder, while in the smaller RC or hobby servos the position sensor is usually a simple potentiometer. The actual position captured by these devices is fed back to the error detector where it is compared to the target position. Then according to the error the controller corrects the actual position of the motor to match with the target position.\n\nIn this tutorial we will take a detailed look at the hobby servo motors. We will explain how these servos work and how to control them using Arduino.\n\nHobby servos are small in size actuators used for controlling RC toys cars, boats, airplanes etc. They are also used by engineering students for prototyping in robotics, creating robotic arms, biologically inspired robots, humanoid robots and so on.\n\nThere are four main components inside of a hobby servo, a DC motor, a gearbox, a potentiometer and a control circuit. The DC motor is high speed and low torque but the gearbox reduces the speed to around 60 RPM and at the same time increases the torque.\n\nThe potentiometer is attached on the final gear or the output shaft, so as the motor rotates the potentiometer rotates as well, thus producing a voltage that is related to the absolute angle of the output shaft. In the control circuit, this potentiometer voltage is compared to the voltage coming from the signal line. If needed, the controller activates an integrated H-Bridge which enables the motor to rotate in either direction until the two signals reach a difference of zero.\n\nA servo motor is controlled by sending a series of pulses through the signal line. The frequency of the control signal should be 50Hz or a pulse should occur every 20ms. The width of pulse determines angular position of the servo and these type of servos can usually rotate 180 degrees (they have a physical limits of travel).\n\nGenerally pulses with 1ms duration correspond to 0 degrees position, 1.5ms duration to 90 degrees and 2ms to 180 degrees. Though the minimum and maximum duration of the pulses can sometimes vary with different brands and they can be 0.5ms for 0 degrees and 2.5ms for 180 degrees position.\n\nRead More: Stepper Motors and Arduino – The Ultimate Guide\n\nThere are many different models and manufacturers of RC or hobby. The main consideration when choosing a servo motor is its torque, operating voltage, current draw and size.\n\nHere are the two most popular servo models among makers, the SG90 Micro Servo and the MG996R.\n\nLet’s put the above said to test and make a practical example of controlling a hobby servo using Arduino. I will use the MG996R which is a high-torque servo featuring metal gearing with stall torque of 10 kg-cm. The high torque comes at a price and that’s the stall current of the servo which is 2.5A. The running current is from 500mA to 900mA and the operating voltage is from 4.8 to 7.2V.\n\nThe current ratings indicate that we cannot directly connect this servo to the Arduino, but we must use a separate power supply for it.\n\nHere’s the circuit diagram for this example.\n\nWe simply need to connect the control pin of the servo to any digital pin of the Arduino board, connect the Ground and the positive wires to the external 5V power supply, and also connect the Arduino ground to the servo ground.\n\nIn case we use a smaller hobby servo, the S90 Micro Servo, it’s possible to power it directly from the 5V Arduino pin.\n\nThe S90 Micro Servo has lower current consumption, around 100-200mA no-load running current, but around 500-700mA stall current. On the other hand, the Arduino 5V pin can output only around 500mA if powered via USB, or up to 1A in powered via the barrel connector.\n\nEven though it’s possible to run these 9g servo motors directly to Arduino, for more stable work I would suggest to always use an external power supply for them.\n\nYou can get the components needed for this example from the links below:\n\nDisclosure: These are affiliate links. As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.\n\nNow let’s take a look at the Arduino code for controlling the servo motor. The code is very simple. We just need to define the pin to which the servo is connect, define that pin as an output, and in the loop section generate pulses with the specific duration and frequency as we explained earlier.\n\nAfter some testing I came up with the following values for the duration of the pulses that work with my servo. Pulses with 0.6ms duration corresponded to 0 degrees position, 1.45ms to 90 degrees and 2.3ms to 180 degrees.\n\nI connected a multimeter in series with the servo to check the current draw. The maximum current draw that I noticed was up to 0.63A at stall. Well that’s because this isn’t the original TowerPro MG996R servo, but a cheaper replica, which obviously has worse performance.\n\nNevertheless, let’s take a look at a more convenient way of controlling servos using Arduino. That’s using the Arduino servo library.\n\nHere we just need to include the library, define the servo object, and using the attach() function define the pin to which the servo is connected as well as define the minimum and maximum values of the pulses durations. Then using the write() function we simply set the position of the servo from 0 to 180 degrees.\n\nThe Arduino servo library supports controlling of up to 12 servos at the same time with most the Arduino boards, and 48 servos using the Arduino Mega board. On top of that, controlling multiple servo motors with Arduino is as easy as controlling just a single one.\n\nHere’s an example code for controlling multiple servos:\n\nSo, we just have to create objects from the Servo class for each servo motor, and define to which Arduino pin is connected. Of course, we can set any servo to move to any position, at any time.\n\nAs an example you can also check my Arduino Ant Hexapod Robot project where I used an Arduino MEGA board to control 22 servo motors.\n\nThere’s also another way of controlling servos with Arduino, and that’s using the PCA9685 servo driver. This is a 16-Channel 12-bit PWM and servo driver which communicates with Arduino using the I2C bus. It has a built in clock so it can drive 16 servos free running, or independently of Arduino.\n\nWhat’s even cooler we can daisy-chain up to 62 of these drivers on a single I2C bus. So theoretically we can control up to 992 servos using only the two I2C pins from the Arduino board. The 6 address select pins are used for setting different I2C addressed for each additional driver. We just need to connect the solder pads according to this table.\n\nHere’s the circuit schematic and we can once again notice that we need a separate power supply for the servos.\n\nYou can get the components needed for this example from the links below:\n\nDisclosure: These are affiliate links. As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.\n\nNow let’s take a look at the Arduino code. For controlling this servo driver we will use the PCA9685 library which can be downloaded from GitHub.\n\nSo first we need to include the libraries and define the PCA9685 object. Then using the Servo_Evaluator instance define the pulses duration or the PWM output of the driver. Note that the outputs are 12-bit, or that’s a resolution of 4096 steps. So the minimum pulse duration of 0.5ms or 0 degrees position would correspond to 102 steps, and the maximum pulse duration of 2.5ms or 180 degrees position to 512 steps. But as explained earlier these values should be adjusted according your servo motor. I had value from 102 to 470 which corresponded to 0 to 180 degrees position.\n\nIn the setup section we need to define the I2C clock rate, set the driver address and set the frequency to 50Hz.\n\nIn the loop section, using the setChannelPWM() and pwmForAngle() functions we simply set the servo to the desired angle.\n\nI connected a second servo to the driver, and as I expected, it wasn’t positioning the same as the first one, and that’s because the servos that I’m using are cheap copies and they are not so reliable. However, this isn’t a big problem because using the Servo_Evaluator instance we can set different output settings for each servo. We can also adjust the 90 degrees position in case it’s not precisely in the middle. In that way all servos will work the same and position at the exact angle.\n\nControlling a lot of servos with Arduino and the PCA9685 drivers\n\nWe will take a look at one more example and that’s controlling a lot of servos with multiple chained PCA9685 drivers.\n\nFor that purpose we need to connect the drivers to each other and connect the appropriate address select solder pads. Here’s the circuit schematic:\n\nLet’s take a look at the Arduino code now.\n\nSo we should create separate PCA9685 object for each driver, define the addresses for each driver as well as set the frequency to 50Hz. Now simply using the setChannelPWM() and pwmForAngle() functions we can set any servo at any driver to position any angle we want.\n\nThis is a common problem with these hobby servo motors, the SG90 Micro Servo and the MG996R. The reason for this is that, as mentioned earlier, they can draw quite significant amount of current when they are at load. This can cause the Arduino board to reset, especially if you are powering the servo directly from the Arduino 5V pin.\n\nIn order to solve this issue you can use a capacitor across the GND and the 5V pin. It will act as a decouple capacitor which will provide additional current to the system at start up when the DC motor starts.\n\nThis is another common problem with these hobby servos. As we explained earlier, a pulse width of 1ms (0.5ms) corresponds to 0 degrees position, and 2ms (2.5ms) to 180 degrees. However, these values can vary from servo to servo and between different manufacturers.\n\nIn order to solve this problem, we need to adjust the pulse width we are sending to the servo motor with the Arduino. Luckily, using the Arduino Servo library we can easily adjust the pulse widths values in the attach() function.\n\nThe attach() function can take two additional parameters, and that’s the minimum and maximum pulse width in microseconds. The default values are 544 microseconds (0.544milliseconds) for minimum (0 degrees) angle, and 2400 microseconds (2.4ms). So by adjusting these values we can fine tune the moment range of the servo.\n\nI made 3D models of the two most popular servo motors, the SG90 Micro Servo and the MG996R servo motor. You can download load them from the links below.\n\nSo, we have covered almost everything we need to know about using servo motors with Arduino. Of course, there are some many manufacturers and models of these type of hobby or RC servo motors, and each of them has its own unique features that might differ from what we explained above.\n\nThe possibilities for creating awesome robotics, automation and RC projects using motors are endless, however choosing the right model for your application is very important.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this tutorial and learned something new.

        "document": "I need to control the speed of a standard servo (not continuous) using Arduino and a R/C radio. I found a lot of example on the web but in most of cases are not suitable for my case. My need is to control the speed of the servo proportionally to the stick movemente, as follow:\n• stick in the center: servo stops in the position where it is.\n\n I have no problem to read stick position from R/C using PulseIn. In the doc I found also the Servo library that however is not suitable. My idea is to increase PWM width proportionally to the stick angle in order to move the servo until it arrives to maximum position or the stick turns to center position. I can't use the servo.write() function because it accepts only an integer parameter from 0 to 180 corresponding to the servo angle. I need to control speed very smooth, using fraction of degrees.\n\nThat's kind of how servo's work - you tell them the angle to go to, and they try and get there as fast as they can. You'll have to write some code that'll moves it in steps. So instead of a single \"Turn to 90 degrees\" command, issue a set of Turn to 1 degree\n\n wait a tiny bit\n\n Turn to 2 degrees\n\n wait a tiny bit\n\n Turn to 3 degrees\n\n ... A \"Tiny Bit\" varies depending on how fast you want to move the servo.\n\nCylindric:\n\n That's kind of how servo's work - you tell them the angle to go to, and they try and get there as fast as they can.

How can I do?\n\nLess than one degree? That's pretty fine. From 12:00 to 12:01 on my watch is 6 degrees. I'm not sure on the detailed internals of servos, but you could roll-your-own servo control and calculate your own PWM pulses, I guess. That's assuming you're using something more clever than a little £5 hobby-servo. Some of those rattle by more than what you're looking for\n\nCylindric:\n\n Less than one degree? That's pretty fine.

Some of those rattle by more than what you're looking for Less then one degree because I'm working on a camera gimbal and I'm using a digital servo metal gear to control tilt movement, if I move the camera support of one degree step-by-step probably video quality is not good (vibration). That's the reason why I need a smooth movement, maybe with a smaller angle.\n\nInteresting. Are you moving your camera one step, then stopping for a noticeable while, then another step, etc? Or is it a smooth-but-slow pan? I'm just curious if the momentum of the kit would keep it smooth enough, even at 1 degree steps. Have you tried it? I only ask, as the risk of prematurely 'optimising' the thing to milli-degree angles might not be necessary.\n\nForgot to add, if it is, then you could experiment by sending your own pulses to the servo using your own timings. Look in the Servo.cpp include to see how it's done. Some scary timing considerations in there Oh, or try the Servo.writeMicroseconds() instead. That allows for fine-grained control, you just need to know your servo's parameters."

Hence servo motor is not a true PWM controlled device.\n\n\n\nPWM conveys the information on the power delivered which doesnt reflect in the servo motor position. \n\n\n\ntake an example - A PWM signal with on time and period ( dutycycle), delivers more power than a PWM signal with on time and a period ( duty cycle). \n\n\n\nThe servo would resond in the same way for both PWM signals. \n\n\n\nUpdate the parameter you send in the function to turn the servo motor by .\n\nRerun the simulation and look at the servo motor position. It’s now in the center position.\n\nLet’s now observe the pulse width of the PWM signal using the logic analyzer data that corresponds to the center position of the motor. \n\n\n\nThe ON width is about . \n\n\n\n\n\nThe frequency is still ( ). The frequency never change. Only the PWM on time pulse width changes.\n\n\n\nUpdate the parameter you send in the function to turn the servo motor by .\n\n\n\nRerun the simulation and look at the servo motor position. It has now moved to the extreme right position.\n\nNow, please look at the PWM signal's pulse width using the logic analyzer data that corresponds to the extreme right position of the motor shaft.\n\n\n\nThe ON width is .\n\n\n\n\n\nThe frequency is still ( ). No change in the frequency. \n\n\n\nA servo motor includes feedback circuitry that helps the motor to continuously adjust the shaft position. Specific servo motors also feature an additional fourth line that outputs an analog value indicating the current shaft position.\n\nThe servo motor controls the position of the shaft based on the PWM pulse width, but why should I still read the feedback if the servo control circuitry already takes care of position precision?\n\nThe additional feedback signal is useful in many situations.\n\nInsufficient power - Insufficient power to drive the load can cause the servo motor to stop at a position other than the intended one.\n\nWhy would this happen? This can occur if the power supply to the motor is not strong enough to overcome the resistance of the load, causing the motor to stall or stop before reaching the desired position.\n\nOther factors that can cause this issue include improper voltage⚡ or current settings, mechanical issues with the motor or load, and electronic problems with the control circuit.\n\nWiring issue - One potential issue that could cause the servo motor to stop at the wrong position due to insufficient power is a disconnected control wire. This can be difficult to detect in a three-wire servo as there is no direct way to check the connection status.\n\nSave Time - Here is the snippet of the prebuilt project. We set the target position using . Did you notice that we had given a delay right after setting the position?\n\nYou know what, the delay is important for our servo motor. It needs enough time to get to where it's going. If we don't give it enough time, it won't reach the target position, and that's just no good. Imagine not activating a switch or only getting a partial movement from a robotic arm in a complex project. 😨\n\nBut, on the other hand, if we give it too much time, we're just wasting time , and the whole operation will be slower. So, it's all about finding that sweet spot. 😉\n\nFeedback pin can be a lifesaver in this situation. Here's the deal, you set the target position and then start keeping an eye on the feedback pin. Once you're sure that the servo has reached where it's supposed to be, you can move on to the next step. This way, you ensure that your project works efficiently. \n\n\n\nIn this article, we observed the Servo Motor data line using the Wokwi logic analyzer. You have learned how a servo motor work and how the control signal changes for the desired rotation angle now debug the servo motor control signal in your next project.\n\nThe article demonstrated the relationship between the drive sginal's “ON” time and motor's shaft position.\n\nIf you have any feedback or suggestions to make the simulator more helpful, you can always connect with us on Facebook, Discord, and Twitter."

        "document": "Huy guys, I just got a package from Hobby King with servo's and they are HEXTRONIC HXT500 5gr minis'.\n\nIv'e tested them out with the Servo Library and they worked Perfetto! However i bought such little ones (they almost fit on your thumb!) for a special purpose. I want to make a light weight and little insect robot. If i want to build it and make it light then I have no option but remove the Arduino Uno from the project and use it only for prototyping. Instead, the robot's brain will be a Attiny 85.\n\nThe Attiny has a problem however, it doesn't support the Servo library for the Arduino. I know that there are Servo libraries for little Attinie's but I prefer to do the code by myself.\n\nI wrote a code to control my servo by pulsing a pulse of between 1ms and 2ms and then a stop period of 19- 18ms (20 - 1 = 19 ms; 20 - 2 = 18 ms). The standard stop period is 20ms, which is 50HZ exactly suitable for the servo's. But the servo just sits still when i upload my sketch to my Arduino Uno.\n\nI have no idea how to alter the PWM signal from 500HZ (default) to 50HZ, so instead i decided to do it with the help of digitalWrite() and delay() functions.\n\nPlease suggest me how to create a suitable PWM signal for controlling a servo.\n\nHere is the code:"
