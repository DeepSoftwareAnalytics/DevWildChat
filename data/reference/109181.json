        "document": "Lua, which means “moon” in Portuguese, is a lightweight and versatile programming language that’s perfect for beginners and experienced programmers alike. It’s like the Swiss Army knife of programming languages — compact, efficient, and capable of performing a variety of tasks. It is known for its simplicity, efficiency, and ease of integration with other programming languages, particularly C and C++.\n• Lightweight and fast: Lua is designed to be small and efficient, making it ideal for embedded systems and applications where performance is critical. It has a tiny memory footprint and fast execution speed.\n• Easy to learn: Lua’s straightforward syntax and minimalistic design make it easy for beginners to pick up and start coding quickly.\n• Extensible: Lua can be easily integrated with other programming languages, especially C and C++. This makes it a powerful tool for adding scripting capabilities to existing applications.\n• Versatile: Lua supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. This versatility allows developers to use the style that best fits their needs.\n• Lua scripting in game development: Lua is extensively used in the gaming industry for scripting game logic, thanks to its speed and flexibility. Popular game engines like Unity and Corona SDK use Lua for their scripting needs.\n• Active community and resources: Lua has an active and supportive community, providing a wealth of libraries, tools, and documentation. This makes it easier for developers to find help and resources as they learn and work with the language.\n• Download the Lua binaries from the official Lua website.\n• Extract the files to a directory of your choice.\n• Add the Lua directory to your system’s PATH environment variable.\n• Open a command prompt and type lua -v to check if the installation was successful.\n• Install Homebrew if you haven’t already: /bin/bash -c “$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)”\n• Verify the installation by typing lua -v in Terminal.\n• Use the package manager to install Lua. For Debian-based systems, type: sudo apt-get install lua5.3\n\nSetting up your development environment is like organizing your workspace before you start a new project. A clean and efficient setup makes coding more enjoyable and productive. You can use any text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Lua development. (Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom.) Ensure you install a Lua extension or plugin for Lua syntax highlighting and other features.\n\nWriting and running your first Lua program\n\nTo run your program, save it as hello.lua and execute it from the command line:\n\nLua’s syntax is straightforward and easy to grasp. Here are some fundamental concepts:\n\nIn Lua, variables are like containers that hold data. Lua is dynamically typed, meaning you don’t need to declare a variable’s type.\n\nOperators are tools for performing operations on variables:\n\nControl structures guide the flow of your program:\n\nFunctions in Lua are like recipes in a cookbook. They define a set of instructions that can be reused multiple times.\n\nVariables declared inside a function are local to that function and cease to exist once the function ends.\n\nHigher-order functions and closures are advanced techniques. They allow functions to be treated as variables and enable the creation of complex behaviors.\n\nTables are the core data structure in Lua and essential for various operations. Lua tables are versatile and can be used as arrays, dictionaries, or even as objects.\n\nUsing tables as arrays and dictionaries\n\nTables can function as arrays and dictionaries:\n\nError handling in Lua is like having a first-aid kit handy—you hope you never need it, but it’s crucial when you do.\n\nCommon error types and how to handle them\n\nErrors can occur due to various reasons, such as syntax errors, runtime errors, or logic errors. Lua provides mechanisms to handle these gracefully using pcall (protected call).\n\nif not status then\n\nDebugging serves a purpose when you need to identify and fix issues systematically. Lua has a built-in debug library that makes this relatively straightforward.\n\nAttention to detail and using best practices are key. Use meaningful variable names, modularize your code, and avoid global variables to ensure your code is maintainable and less prone to errors.\n\nLibraries and modules in Lua are specialized tools, providing additional functionality and making complex tasks easier.\n\nLua comes with several built-in libraries that provide a wide range of functionalities, such as string manipulation, mathematical operations, and file I/O.\n\nHow to use and create modules\n\nModules in Lua allow you to organize your code into reusable components, much like having labeled drawers in a toolbox.\n\nLua has a rich ecosystem of third-party libraries that extend its capabilities. Some popular ones include:\n\nLua is like a multi-tool; its applications range from embedded systems to game development and beyond.\n\nLua’s lightweight nature makes it ideal for embedded systems and IoT devices. It’s like a precision tool that fits perfectly into small spaces, providing powerful scripting capabilities without consuming much memory or processing power.\n\nLua is commonly used for scripting and IT automation, allowing users to automate repetitive tasks and extend the functionality of applications.\n\nFor those who want to delve deeper, Lua offers advanced features like metatables, metamethods, coroutines, and integration with C/C++ code.\n\nMetatables and metamethods are Lua’s way of customizing the behavior of tables. These can be a secret ingredient that add a unique flavor to your programs.\n\nCoroutines provide a powerful way to handle asynchronous tasks, allowing for cooperative multitasking without the complexity of threads.\n\nLua can be embedded in C/C++ applications, providing a flexible scripting interface.\n\nLua is a versatile and powerful programming language that’s easy to learn and fun to use. By understanding its basic concepts, syntax, and applications, you can start your journey in Lua programming with confidence.\n\nRemember, learning a new programming language is like learning to play a musical instrument—it requires practice and patience. If you’re eager to keep learning, check out Learn Lua in 15 Minutes, a Lua tutorial for beginners that’s also a Lua app that you can actually run.\n\nKeep experimenting, building projects, and exploring the vast resources available for further learning. Happy coding with Lua!"

        "document": "Picking up programming and learning it for the first time works just like any other hobby–art, music, sports, photography, etc.–although, it may be difficult to know where to start as a beginner, especially if you’ve never had experience with it up until now. When I was younger, it was very difficult for me to get into programming as tutorials for a younger, completely unexperienced audience was rare. Although there was plenty of content available, I still had a hard time understanding the material or just got lost in the sea of information that was given to me. There are still plenty of places on either Youtube or other parts of the internet where beginners can learn, but I’ve specifically compiled this list so that you have a neat, simple page you can refer to if you feel lost, or don’t know where to go after searching for tutorials. Becoming an experienced programmer from scratch will not be easy, it will take a lot of effort and more importantly time to become an expert. I say this because many developers I’ve personally known, whether rookies or professionals, tend to bail halfway through their project or goal. Do not lose hope when things don’t come as quickly as you expected, patience is crucial. What sets poor and excellent students isn’t necessarily intelligence, but their willingness to put in work and always seeking new ways to become better at what they do. Think of this article as a legend for Lua, similar to the page in a large book that highlight specific terms or character in the book that the reader might not recognize. When you finish this guide, your ability to code things will be limited, but you should have a much easier time understanding tutorials on more advanced topics. Ultimately, I hope this article can help you get started, or at least guide you through your journey through programming.\n\nP.S. I’ve tried to make this tutorial as kid-friendly as possible, if it is still difficult to read or understand, please DM me on any platform and I’ll try my best fix it. Specific examples are appreciated.\n\nChances are, if you’ve ever played a game, you’ve wondered how it was made. How does a sword go from unequipped to swinging in just a matter of seconds? Why? How is this app able to stream the movies I select? How is the website we’re currently on even able to operate?\n\nComputer programming is an essential part of modern life, as it determines and allows for many technologies we use on a daily basis to operate. However, all code is not written in the same way, rather, there are distinct languages, or ways of writing code. In fact, you might already be familiar with the names of various programming languages, including but not limited to JavaScript or Python.\n\nIn this tutorial, we’ll be covering Lua, the official language of Roblox which can be used to create a variety of different games for users to play.\n\nIn this tutorial, we’ll be using a specific format to write, input, and receive the result of our script. To use a format identical to mine, click on View in the upper left side of your screen, then make sure you have selected and have the following settings:\n\nYour screen should look something similar to this\n\nScripts can be inserted almost everywhere, for the sake of keeping this tutorial short, head over to Model on the top panel and browse to the far left and click on Script, which will generate a script that we can use for our tutorial.\n\nPrint is a built-in function which prints out whatever statement you decide to give it. This can be either number or strings, which we’ll cover in this section. You’ll notice that once you launch a script, there is already a print function automatically typed out for you. This code always comes with your scripts, so we’ll erase it to continue with the next step.\n\nType out print in all lowercase letters. If print is typed incorrectly or typed with any capitals, the program will not recognize the command and will not run it. Add a pair of parenthesis after, studio should automatically add the second one. Make sure there is no space in between print and the parenthesis otherwise Lua will not be able to read it.\n\nNext, we need to add a string in-between the parenthesis so that we don’t just print empty space. A string is any character or words inside of a pair of quotes, such as “Hello World!” For our tutorial, we’ll be adding the string “YellowNoobs!” for the program to print.\n\nYou may replace \"YellowNoobs\" with any other text you wish as long as it is in-between the parenthesis (\"\"), the end result should look something like this,\n\nIf you want to include quotation marks in your quote, you can also use a pair of single quotes (’’) and put the double parenthesis, or vice-versa for single quotes to be printed.\n\nPrint also works for numbers and equations, which it’ll automatically simplify in the output. But before we write out our problem, we need to find the symbols needed to get the right answer.\n\nArithmetic operators are basically all the tools we use in programming to indicate a relationship between numbers. This sounds complicated, but it’s just what we call the symbols we use to add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers.\n\nHere are the Arithmetic Operators used in Lua:\n\nNow, we’ll write our equation in-between the parenthesis, and paste it into the command bar once we’re ready to get the output. Feel free to mess around with the operators to get the hang of it.\n\nIf we put our code into the command bar we’ll get 81 instead. This is the answer to the equation, and Lua does this because it’s a simplified version, or answer to the problem we originally printed. An important thing to keep in mind is that Lua completes the math using the Order of Operations, meaning it starts with exponents, then division and multiplication, and finally addition and subtraction.\n\nTake this piece of code for example,\n\nWhile you may be tempted to say the answer is 12, since you add 1 + 5, getting 6 and multiplying it by 2, this is wrong. Instead, you multiply 5 and 2 first, then add 1, getting 11. This is a rule of both math and programming, so practice the concept until you can avoid printing the wrong number.\n\nIn order to combine two or more separate values together, you can use concatenation in the print function. We’ll still use the same format, but will add two periods or dots after each string. Do not place this inside of the string, otherwise Lua will interpret it as part of the string and produce an error.\n\nIf we paste this into the command bar, the output will show us a full statement as if it was a single string, meaning the concatenation was successful.\n\nNow that you’ve learned how to make a script, you’ll learn what variables are and how to make your own. Variables are considered vital because they save a lot of time and save you time and make your scripts simpler to review. They can be booleans, numbers, strings, or practically anything you want to assign a name to.\n\nIf you’re struggling to understand the concept of a variable, you can compare it to a nickname you might give someone who’s name may be too tedious to pronounce. Although it is not their birthname, calling them by their nickname will still get their attention as they’ve been given and called by it before.\n\nBelow, I’ve given an example of a variable. The term “variable” will be used interchangeably with the string “YellowNoobs!” whenever we use it in the script. If we put the variable inside of the print command, it will print the text assigned to it. Since the variable is identical to the string we assigned it, we do not need any quotes around the variable name. If you put quotes around a variable name, Lua will interpret it as a string, and print the actual name rather than the value.\n\nIf we copy and paste the code into the input, the output will print our statement.\n\nIt is necessary that you define your variables before using them in your code. Since Lua reads code from top to bottom, it will not know what the variable stands for when it executes the print function. If we paste the code into our command bar, we’ll get the output nil, which means nothing or no data.\n\nWhenever we define the variable, its scope covers all of the code below in the script. Variable scope is just another word for when the variable can be accessed in your script.\n\nThere are two types of variables which you’ll hear about, local and global. The variables we’ve made in this tutorial so far have been global variables, which means they can be accessed in all code below inside the script. Local variables will be covered later in this tutorial, but in simplest terms, they have a much more limited scope.\n\nVariables do not only have to be named “variable” when assigned to a given piece of code. In fact, your variables have to be different names in order for the program to recognize which variable you want it to use in the script.\n\nWhile you can almost freely name your variables, there are a few restrictions that exist inside Lua.\n\nYou can use:\n\nYou can not use:\n• Capital letters as the first letter of the variable (Not required, but common practice)\n• Numbers as the first letter of the variable\n\nComments are a simple green text that organize and give context to your lines of code, which can be a useful tool for yourself or others if you plan on sharing it.\n\nCreating comments is extremely easy, add - - and then your text after you are finished. It should appear something like this.\n\nIf you want your comment to cover more than one line, insert brackets, with your text inside.\n\nAny text attached to the comment will not be executed by the program, and will only be seen by the reader. This green text is helpful in case you want to find a specific piece of code in your script. Comments are also crucial if you plan on sharing your scripts and want the reader to understand what certain commands do. Besides context, you can use comments to credit yourself for your script, or write out directions that the user who uses your script might want to see.\n\nIf you want to change the settings (such as the transparency, or invisibility) of an object in the workspace, you have to write down the specifics before Lua knows what you want it to do.\n\nSo, if we want to change the transparency of the baseplate, we first need to define that the baseplate is inside game.Workspace, with game being the game we’re working on and workspace being the place where baseplate and the rest of our parts are stored. Then, we write the object we’ll be changing (baseplate) and the setting that we want to change (its transparency), and then assign a value to it. If we want it to be fully invisible, we’ll set the value to one, lowering this amount will make it so that it’s semi-transparent.\n\nIn the end, this should make the baseplate completely invisible if we run the code or play the game. Keep in mind that we can change the properties of object in Studio as long as you define it correctly in the code.\n\nWhen you’re writing a sequence of code that needs to be repeated, it may be a little tedious and also messy to write it out several times. Functions are a tool in Lua that we can use to put lines of different code in, which can be repeated and manipulated a lot easier by us. The functions in this segment are not to be confused with the built-in functions of Lua, such as print.\n\nTo define a function, we need to write function and then assign it a name. Then, add a pair of parenthesis after your function name without any spacing in-between, and press enter. I’ll be naming my function printStuff, but you can name yours differently.\n\nNow, we need to write our code for our function to actually execute it. You’ll notice that when you press enter after writing your function, you’ll automatically get end. This statement is here so that you can end, or close off your function, otherwise Lua would get an error.\n\nI want to print several strings, so I’ll insert the several sequences of code inside my function.\n\nWe now have our function, however, nothing will be happen since we haven’t written the command to execute it. We need to type the function name on the next line, and Lua will print our strings.\n\nNow, Lua will execute our code. If we paste all of the content into the command bar, we’ll see that our function is successful. It’s important to note that just like variables, functions need to defined before we actually execute them in our code, otherwise we’ll just get nil.\n\nWhen we covered local variables previously in our tutorial, I mentioned that the scope of it was much more limited. Whereas global variables can be accessed anywhere in our script after being defined, local variables are limited to a block.\n\nSo what is a code block? An example is basically the indented sequence of code that we see in our function. I’ll attach comments to the parts that are a part of the block of code for a visual demonstration.\n\nYou can also tell if something is a block by the small arrow that appears to the left. If you look closely, the arrow facing down next to function is indicating that the block is being shown, and when it is facing up, it means it is closed.\n\nIf we try to print the local variable outside the block, we’ll get nil since the variable can’t be accessed.\n\nA handy feature of functions is the ability to manipulate the variables with ease. You might’ve already noticed the pair of parenthesis when we define the function, and the two other parenthesis when we execute it. These are the spaces where we put our arguments and parameters.\n\nEvery time we execute a function, we might want to change certain parts of the code each time. Parameters are used to tell Lua which variables (and thus any information) inside the function you want to change. They are established when we first define our function, and are placed in-between the first pair of parenthesis on the same line. Make sure to not define the variable you’ll be changing inside of your function, otherwise the parameter will not work.\n\nNow that we’ve defined the parameter, we need to write an argument for the function to be properly executed. An argument is the value we assign the code when executing it. It comes inside our next pair of parenthesis, and can be changed every time we execute the function separately. We’ll print a string and a number, and the program should treat the argument as the variable in the function.\n\nNow if we put it in the output, the two values should be successfully printed.\n\nArguments and parameters aren’t just limited to a single pair, in fact there can be as many as you want. In order to add another pair, separate each parameter and argument by a comma with the next one you want in your function.\n\nNow if we paste it into our command bar, the output should print both statements in the order we gave them. It is important that you put the arguments and parameters in the same order or you will assign the wrong value to the variable. Also, you always have to define your parameters when you execute your function, otherwise Lua will not know what to assign to the variables.\n\nYou might’ve already noticed that below the option to create a script, there is something called a local script. This tutorial won’t go too in-depth about them, but offer a broad summary about its purpose.\n\nLocal scripts are scripts that only affect the user’s client rather than the server. A user’s client is basically what they see, rather than the whole server. So whereas you might be seeing something, your friend playing the same game as you might see something completely different. In comparison, scripts that affect the server are seen by everyone, and not just the individual’s client.\n\nThe concept is a bit difficult to describe by text, and I still can’t do it justice by talking about it in depth, so I urge you to look at this video by TheDevKing to get a better idea of what local scripts are capable of.\n\nYou might’ve heard this word in math class and it is related. Booleans in scripting are the conditions true or false.\n\nWhen comparing values you’ll get a Boolean as well, although you can simply write true or false too.\n\nRelational operators are the operators used to compare values with one another.\n• Equal to, not to be confused with equal which simply assigns something rather than comparing two values: ==\n• Not equal to, which is true if the values are not equal: ~=\n• Greater than or equal to: >=\n• Less than or equal to: <=\n\nNow, let’s take a look at some numbers and see if they represent a true or false boolean\n\nThe first one is false, since the value can only be greater than, and not equal to the other. The next one is true as the values are equal to one another. The last is clearly false, since 8 is not less than the number 2.\n\nIf statements make it so that specific commands only happen if the condition is met, it will execute the code.\n\nFor example, if 5 > 1 the Output will print “Congratulations” since 5 > 1 is true. If the script said 5 < 1 then the script will not print “Congratulations” in Output.\n\nThis is equivalent to saying true instead and will still print our string.\n\nSometimes, our code needs to be repeated in order to produce an outcome we’re looking for. Loops are statements that allow us to repeat code multiple times. They come in several different forms, which we’ll cover in this section of the tutorial.\n\nWhile loops repeat sequences of code while the statement is true. However, when the condition is false, it will not execute the code block. For example, while a variable is less than a certain value, it will continue to print out a string we decide to give it. This is just one of countless things you can do with a while loop, so feel free to get creative if you’re feeling ambitious.\n\nFor our while loop, we’ll assign a number to our variable, x. Afterwards, we go on the next line and write while. This helps Lua understand that it is a while loop, so that when the condition is true, it’ll execute the code block. The do you see after our boolean is simply telling Lua to execute the block of code that is part of the loop when the condition is true.\n\nIn this code, I defined my variable as 10 and made it so that the while loop would continue to run until it was no longer less than a 100. Each time it runs the code, I made it so that it would add 10 to the variable, meaning that once it ran several times, it would no longer execute the code since the condition is false.\n\nNotice the string being printed after the loop. This is not executed until the loop is finished, so not attaching it to the loop can be used to tell us when the loop is finished.\n\nFor loops are able to loop as many times as the user wants. First, we define a variable for the loop, and assign it to a starting and ending value. The loop will continue to repeat until the starting value reaches the end value. While the amount the starting value increases is by 1, you can change it by adding a comma after the end value. Below, is an example of a for loop.\n\nOur loop will now print 1, 6, 11, 16 all the way until 21 where it will stop since it can not go past 25.\n\nHere is the format for the for loop.\n\nA repeat loop repeats the statements assigned to it until a following condition is true.\n\nUnlike a while loop, it runs the statements first before checking if the condition is true.\n\nWriting break at the end of a loop will end the loop if a condition is true. In the example below, break is used to break out of an infinite loop that otherwise keeps running because it is always true.\n\nThis could also work if instead of true we wrote while x < 200 do. The result would be that the loop would end early, ending when x reaches 100 rather than 200.\n\nYou may also hear the term nested loop, which is used to describe a loop with another loop inside of it.\n\nTables are used for storing large sets of data that you might use while creating your script. With tables, you can access and manipulate the data easy, which can come in handy later on. In this section, you’ll be learning about just a single type of tables, arrays.\n\nArrays are simply a list of values compiled in a table. This can include strings, numbers, booleans, functions–pretty much anything that can be used outside the script. To make an array, start by assigning a name of your own to the table.\n\nAfter this first step, you need to assign the data to the table. Assign the table to the data by adding an “=” in between, and write a pair of curly brackets (the second bracket will be automatically typed for you).\n\nNext, you can place all of your values inside of the array. For this tutorial, we’ll place a few strings and numbers together, but you can add more variety to your table if you’re following along. Make sure to separate each value by adding commas in-between them.\n\nIf we want to print specific parts of our array, we can use the index to get what we want. Each value in our array has an index, or number assigned to it. The first value is 1, second value is 2, third value is 3, etc. To print a specific part of our array, we put our table name in the print function, then follow it up with the index of the value, in-between brackets ([]).\n\nIn the end, this should print out our first string, “Hello World” in the output.\n\nWhere Else Can I Learn About Scripting?\n\nThere are many other places to learn, but the sources listed above have helped me with learning or adapting to Lua.\n\nWhat is the Difference Between Input and Output?\n\nInput is the code given to the engine, while output is the received/finished command. For example, print(“YellowNoobs!”) is a input while YellowNoobs is the output.\n\nStopping exploiters isn’t a beginner issue, it is a little more advanced than what we’ve discussed so far. Throughout your scripting career, you’ll realize that the main reason for exploits is due to poor and weak scripts that hackers are able to bypass.\n\nOne feature that Roblox automatically now applies to all games is FilteringEnabled, which prevents hackers from messing with the server itself. To learn more about how it works, you can watch the following video by AlvinBlox,\n\nWhy does Studio Automatically Indent for me?\n\nTechnically, indenting is not necessary, but it is extremely helpful and keeps your code organized. For example, through indents, you can see where your code blocks are. Not only that, but it looks much cleaner. Writing without proper indentation would give both you and the programmers reviewing your code a headache to read.\n\nHow do I become better?\n\nPractice, practice makes perfect, no exceptions. Learning to program unique things by yourself is always something you should strive to achieve as a developer.\n\nThat’s it, the basic tutorial is now finally finished! Hopefully, now you’ll have a far easier time being able to understand new concepts and can use this as a reference whenever you feel stuck.\n\nIf you have any other questions or feedback, please reply in the comments below, good luck!"

Toward this purpose, our guide ensures that learning Lua scripting is not only rewarding but also a fun and engaging process!\n\nGetting Started With Lua in Roblox\n\nFirstly, to begin Lua scripting in Roblox, you must first create a new baseplate. Go to Roblox Studio, click on ‘New’, and select ‘Baseplate’.\n\nNow, let us delve into creating your first Lua script in Roblox. Right-click on ‘Workspace’, hover over ‘Insert Object’, and select ‘Script’.\n\nYou will now see an auto-generated script:\n\nA variable in Lua is used to store a value. Variables can be likened to containers, where various data can be stored for use in scripts.\n\nArrays or tables in Lua are versatile and can store different value types. They can be indexed with numbers or strings. For example:\n\nIn Lua, you can define a function in the following manner:\n\nYou have learnt some basics of Lua scripting in Roblox. With this knowledge, you can begin experimenting with unique game development ideas on the Roblox platform. In the next part, we will delve deeper and explore some more complex examples.\n\nControl structures guide the flow of execution in your program – whether Lua scripting in Roblox or some other language entirely. There are three types of control structures in Lua: while, repeat…until, and for.\n\nThe ‘while’ loop continues executing while a certain condition is true. For example:\n\nThis will print the numbers 1 through 5.\n\nThe ‘repeat…until’ loop is similar to a ‘while’ loop but checks the condition at the end:\n\nThe ‘for’ loop is used when you know exactly how many times you want the loop to execute. For instance:\n\nLua provides various operators for data manipulation. Here are some common examples:\n\nConditionals are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. Here is an example of an ‘if’ conditional statement in Lua:\n\nThis script will print “a is less than b”.\n\nHaving trouble keeping up? Our Roblox Game Development Mini-Degree offers a more thorough overview of using Lua with Roblox to bring your games to life – all with built-in multiplayer support.\n\nLua supports first-class functions, which means that functions can be stored in variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and even returned by other functions. Lua also supports closures. Here is an example:\n\nBy understanding these coding concepts, you can start creating interactive environments and unique player experiences in your Roblox games.\n\nIn Roblox, ‘Events’ are a way for different scripts and instances to communicate with each other. They connect with all scripts and instances handling the same event.\n\nFor example, here’s how we handle the CharacterAdded event with Lua scripting in Roblox:\n\nLet’s talk about how you can create a custom timer using Lua. This could be useful for creating time-based mechanics in your game.\n\nLua provides great support for working with strings. Here are just a few examples:\n\nAs a game developer, it’s crucial to be able to read player input. In Roblox, you can read input using the UserInputService:\n\nWith the knowledge of these key coding aspects, you’re well underway to creating your own immersive Roblox game! We conclude here but the vast potential for creativity using the Lua scripting in Roblox is limitless and ripe for exploration.\n\nAs your thrilling adventure into the world of Lua scripting for Roblox progresses, we urge you to continue exploring and practicing.

        "document": "When I joined this subreddit, I thought this would be a place where developers shared their creations and provide inspiration. Instead, everything here is just “Pls help!!!” “Can someone make me a car script that lets you drive and refill gas thank you pls” or “Game not working” “yeah so pls help” were the poster provides either no context or screenshots, or the free model they found in the toolbox is giving out errors. I am perfectly fine and appreciative of posts that ask how certain Lua things work, and respond to them with helpful info and thank them for actually wanting to learn the language.\n\nThis is the end of my rant.\n\nIf you have different opinions, please share them, I want to see different perspectives."
