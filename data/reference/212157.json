        "document": "The TEXT function lets you change the way a number appears by applying formatting to it with format codes. It's useful in situations where you want to display numbers in a more readable format, or you want to combine numbers with text or symbols. Note: The TEXT function converts numbers to text, which may make it difficult to reference in later calculations. It’s best to keep your original value in one cell, and then use the TEXT function in another cell. Then, if you need to build other formulas, always reference the original value and not the TEXT function result.\n\nIn its simplest form, the TEXT function says:\n• =TEXT(Value you want to format, \"Format code you want to apply\") Here are some popular examples, which you can copy directly into Excel to experiment with on your own. Notice the format codes within quotation marks. Currency with a thousands separator and 2 decimals, like $1,234.57. Note that Excel rounds the value to 2 decimal places. Today’s day of the week, like Monday Fraction, like 1/3. Note this uses the TRIM function to remove the leading space with a decimal value. Note: Although you can use the TEXT function to change formatting, it’s not the only way. You can change the format without a formula by pressing CTRL+1 (or +1 on the Mac), then pick the format you want from the Format Cells > Number dialog box.\n\nOther format codes that are available You can use the Format Cells dialog box to find the other available format codes:\n• Press Ctrl+1 ( +1 on the Mac) to bring up the Format Cells dialog box.\n• Select the format you want from the Number tab.\n• The format code you want is now shown in the Type box. In this case, select everything from the Type box except the semicolon (;) and @ symbol. In the example below, we selected and copied just mm/dd/yy.\n• Press Ctrl+C to copy the format code, and then press Cancel to dismiss the Format Cells dialog box.\n• Now, all you need to do is press Ctrl+V to paste the format code into your TEXT formula, like: =TEXT(B2,\"mm/dd/yy\"). Make sure that you paste the format code within quotes (\"format code\"), otherwise Excel will give you an error message.\n\nFollowing are some examples of how you can apply different number formats to your values by using the Format Cells dialog box, and then use the Custom option to copy those format codes to your TEXT function. Why does Excel delete my leading 0’s? Excel is trained to look for numbers being entered in cells, not numbers that look like text, like part numbers or SKU's. To retain leading zeros, format the input range as Text before you paste or enter values. Select the column, or range where you'll be putting the values, then use CTRL+1 to bring up the Format > Cells dialog and on the Number tab select Text. Now Excel will keep your leading 0's. If you’ve already entered data and Excel has removed your leading 0's, you can use the TEXT function to add them back. You can reference the top cell with the values and use =TEXT(value,\"00000\"), where the number of 0’s in the formula represents the total number of characters you want, then copy and paste to the rest of your range. If for some reason you need to convert text values back to numbers you can multiply by 1, like =D4*1, or use the double-unary operator (--), like =--D4. Excel separates thousands by commas if the format contains a comma (,) that is enclosed by number signs (#) or by zeros. For example, if the format string is \"#,###\", Excel displays the number 12200000 as 12,200,000. A comma that follows a digit placeholder scales the number by 1,000. For example, if the format string is \"#,###.0,\", Excel displays the number 12200000 as 12,200.0.\n• The thousands separator is dependent on your regional settings. In the US it's a comma, but in other locales it might be a period (.).\n• The thousands separator is available for the number, currency and accounting formats. Following are examples of standard number (thousands separator and decimals only), currency and accounting formats. Currency format allows you to insert the currency symbol of your choice and aligns it next to your value, while accounting format will align the currency symbol to the left of the cell and the value to the right. Note the difference between the currency and accounting format codes below, where accounting uses an asterisk (*) to create separation between the symbol and the value. To find the format code for a currency symbol, first press Ctrl+1 (or +1 on the Mac), select the format you want, then choose a symbol from the Symbol drop-down: Then click Custom on the left from the Category section, and copy the format code, including the currency symbol. Note: The TEXT function does not support color formatting, so if you copy a number format code from the Format Cells dialog that includes a color, like this: $#,##0.00_);[Red]($#,##0.00), the TEXT function will accept the format code, but it won't display the color. You can alter the way a date displays by using a mix of \"M\" for month, \"D\" for days, and \"Y\" for years. Format codes in the TEXT function aren't case sensitive, so you can use either \"M\" or \"m\", \"D\" or \"d\", \"Y\" or \"y\". If you share Excel files and reports with users from different countries, then you might want to give them a report in their language. Excel MVP, Mynda Treacy has a great solution in this Excel Dates Displayed in Different Languages article. It also includes a sample workbook you can download. You can alter the way time displays by using a mix of \"H\" for hours, \"M\" for minutes, or \"S\" for seconds, and \"AM/PM\" for a 12-hour clock. If you leave out the \"AM/PM\" or \"A/P\", then time will display based on a 24-hour clock. Format codes in the TEXT function aren't case sensitive, so you can use either \"H\" or \"h\", \"M\" or \"m\", \"S\" or \"s\", \"AM/PM\" or \"am/pm\". You can alter the way decimal values display with percentage (%) formats. You can alter the way decimal values display with fraction (?/?) formats. Scientific notation is a way of displaying numbers in terms of a decimal between 1 and 10, multiplied by a power of 10. It is often used to shorten the way that large numbers display. Special formats will be different depending on locale, but if there aren't any special formats for your locale, or if these don't meet your needs then you can create your own through the Format Cells > Custom dialog.\n\nThe TEXT function is rarely used by itself, and is most often used in conjunction with something else. Let’s say you want to combine text and a number value, like “Report Printed on: 03/14/12”, or “Weekly Revenue: $66,348.72”. You could type that into Excel manually, but that defeats the purpose of having Excel do it for you. Unfortunately, when you combine text and formatted numbers, like dates, times, currency, etc., Excel doesn’t know how you want to display them, so it drops the number formatting. This is where the TEXT function is invaluable, because it allows you to force Excel to format the values the way you want by using a format code, like \"MM/DD/YY\" for date format. In the following example, you’ll see what happens if you try to join text and a number without using the TEXT function. In this case, we’re using the ampersand (&) to concatenate a text string, a space (\" \"), and a value with =A2&\" \"&B2. As you can see, Excel removed the formatting from the date in cell B2. In the next example, you'll see how the TEXT function lets you apply the format you want."

        "document": "In the previous article, we discussed different ways to convert text to date in Excel. If you are looking for a solution to the opposite task - changing an Excel date to text - a few choices are available to you again.\n\nTraditionally, we'll begin with a formula solution and then explore a couple of non-formula ways.\n\nUsing TEXT function in Excel to convert date to text The Excel TEXT function is specially designed to convert a numeric value to a text string and display it in the format you specify. The syntax of the Excel TEXT function is as follows:\n• is a numeric value you want to convert to text. This can be a number, a formula that returns a numeric value, or a reference to a cell containing a number.\n• this is how you want to format the resulting text value, provided as a text string enclosed in quotation marks. For example, you can use the following formula to convert a date in cell A1 to a text string in the traditional US date format (month/day/year): As you see in the screenshot above, the value returned by the TEXT formula is aligned to the left, which is the first sign that points to a date formatted as text. Apart from alignment in a cell, there are a few more indicators that can help you distinguish between dates and text strings in Excel. Example 1. How to convert date to text strings in different formats Since Excel dates are serial numbers in their nature, the Excel TEXT function has no problem with converting them to text values. The most challenging part is probably specifying the proper display formatting for the text dates.\n• mmm - short form of the month name, for example Mar\n• mmmm - full form of the month name, for example March\n• mmmmm - month as the first letter, for example M (stands for March and May)\n• ddd - abbreviated day of the week, for example Sun\n• dddd - full name of the day of the week, for example Sunday To display the converted text date exactly the way you want, you can separate the date codes with various delimiters such as dash (-), slash (/), comma (,) colon (:), etc. Here are a few examples:\n• \"mm/dd/yyyy\" - the date format used in the USA, displays as 03/08/2015\n• \"dd/mm/yyyy\" - the date format used by the rest of the world, displays as 08/03/2015\n• \"dd-mmm-yy\" - displays as 08-Mar-15 to avoid any confusion : )\n• \"dddd, mmmm d, yyyy\" - full date, including the day of the week, displays as Sunday, March 08, 2015 For example, if you have a column of US dates in Excel and you need to export them to a .csv file for your UK based partner, you can convert the dates to the UK format, as a courtesy: Some more formula examples and their results are shown below:\n\n \n\n Example 2. How to convert time to text strings If your date entries display both dates and times and you want to change them to text strings exactly as they are, you included the following time codes in the format_text argument of the Excel TEXT function.\n• h - hours without a leading zero, as 0-23.\n• hh - hours with a leading zero, as 00-23.\n• m - minutes without a leading zero, as 0-59\n• mm - minutes with a leading zero, as 00-59\n• AM/PM - displays as AM or PM\n• If not specified, 24-hour time format is used As you probably noticed, the m codes are used for months as well as minutes, and you might be curious how Microsoft Excel distinguishes between them. If you put \"m\" immediately after h codes (hours) or immediately before s codes (seconds), Excel understands you want to display minutes rather than a month. Yep, it's that simple : ) The TEXT function in Excel allows including both date and time codes in the argument, for example: If you want to convert the time portion only, then put only the time codes, like this: The results of your TEXT formulas may look similar to this:\n\n \n\n Example 3. How to convert the current date to text in Excel In case you want to convert the current date to the text format, you can use the Excel TEXT function in combination with the TODAY function that returns the current date, for example: The result of this formula would show up as 08-Mar-2015. If you prefer to display the resulting text string in some other format, please see the date codes discussed in Example 1.\n\n Example 4. Excel TEXT formula to convert text to date Though the main destination of the TEXT function in Excel is converting numbers to text, it can also perform a reverse conversion, i.e. change text to date. For this, you simply add the double negation (--) to your TEXT formula. For example, to convert a text string in cell A1 to date, you use the below formula, and then format the cell as a date. Note. In the above examples, we used the date and time codes for the English locale of Excel. If you have a different locale, the codes may be different for your language.\n\nConverting date to text with Excel's Text to Columns wizard As you've just seen, Excel's TEXT function makes a good job of converting dates to text. But if you are not a big fan of Excel formulas, you might like this solution better. If you had a chance to read the previous part of our Excel dates tutorial, you already know how to use Text to Columns to change text to date. To convert dates to text strings, you proceed in the same way with the only difference that you choose Text instead of Date on the final step of the wizard. Note. The Text to Column wizard always converts dates in the default short date format regardless of how the original dates are displayed in your worksheet. You can find more about default date and time formats in the following article: Default date format in Excel. If the default date format is not what you are looking for, you can jump right to the next solution that lets you convert dates to text strings in any format of your choosing. If you don't mind the default format, then perform the following steps:\n• In your Excel spreadsheet, select all of the dates you want to change to text.\n• On the Data tab, find the Data Tools group, and click Text to Columns.\n• On step 1 of the wizard, select the Delimited file type and click Next.\n• On step 2 of the wizard, make sure none of the delimiter boxes is checked and click Next.\n• On step 3 of the wizard, which is the final step, select Text under Column data format and click Finish. Tip. If you don't want the resulting text strings to overwrite the original dates, specify the Destination for the top cell of the new column.\n\n That was really easy, right? The screenshot below demonstrates the result - dates converted to text strings in the default short date format set in your Windows Regional settings, which is \"mm/dd/yyyy\" in my case:\n\n \n\n\n\nAnother quick no-formula way to turn Excel dates into text strings is using Notepad or any other text editor. Unlike the Text to Columns wizard, it allows you to convert Excel date to text in any format of your choosing.\n• In your Excel worksheet, format the dates exactly as you want the text strings to look like.\n• Select all of the dates you want to convert and press to copy them.\n• Open Notepad or any other text editor, and paste the copied dates there.\n• Notepad automatically converts the dates to the text format. Press to select all text strings, and then to copy them.\n• Switch back to Microsoft Excel, select the column where you want to insert the text strings and apply the Text format to it. To do this, press to open the Format Cells dialog and select Text on the Number tab.\n• Finally, select the first cell where you want to insert the text strings and press to paste them. The following screenshot shows the result, with the original Excel dates in column B and text entries in column D. Please notice that the converted text strings reflect the original date format with absolute accuracy, except they are left-alighted, as all text values are supposed to be in Excel.\n\n \n\n\n\nThis is how you convert date to text in Excel. Next week we will explorer a few Excel functions to work with weekdays and days of the year. And in the meantime, you may want to check out the previous parts of our comprehensive tutorial to working with dates and times in Excel."

        "document": "This tutorial explains the specificities of the Excel TEXT function and shows some clever ways to use Text formulas in Excel.\n\nMicrosoft Excel is all about numbers, and in your worksheets, you are likely to deal with numbers most of the time. However, there are situations when you need to convert numbers to text, and it is where the TEXT function steps in.\n\nIn its pure essence, TEXT in Excel is used to convert a numeric value to a text string in a specific format. The syntax for the Excel TEXT function is as follows:\n• Value - the numeric value to be converted to text. It can be a number, date, reference to a cell containing a numeric value or another function that returns a number or date.\n• Format_text - the format that you want to apply. It is supplied in the form of a format code enclosed in the quotation marks, e.g. \"mm/dd/yy\". The TEXT function is available in all versions of Excel 365, Excel 2021, Excel 2019, Excel 2016, Excel 2013, Excel 2010, Excel 2007, and lower. Generally, an Excel TEXT formula is used in the following situations:\n• To display numbers in a more readable way or in a format that makes more sense for your users.\n• To combine numbers or dates with certain text or characters. For example, if you want to pull the date from cell A2 and show it in another cell in the traditional date format like \"January 1, 2016\", you use the following Excel TEXT formula: The result will look similar to this: Important note! The TEXT function in Excel converts a numeric value to a text strings. Consequently, you won't be able to use the result of your Text formula in other calculations. If there's such a need, you can keep the original values (hidden or kept out of sight), and use them in other formulas.\n\nAs you have just seen, the syntax of the Excel TEXT function is very straightforward, a tricky part is supplying a proper format code that will output your number the way you want. Essentially, the TEXT function accepts most of the format codes used in Excel number formats. The table below lists the most common and frequently used ones. #.00 - always displays 2 decimal places. If you type 2.5 in the referenced cell, it will display as 2.50. Digit placeholder that does not display extra zeros. #.## - displays up to 2 decimal places. If you type 2.5, it will display as 2.5. If you type 2.555, it will display as 2.56. Digit placeholder that leaves a space for insignificant zeros but doesn't display them. It is generally used to align numbers in a column at a decimal point. #.?? - displays a maximum of 2 decimal places and aligns the decimal points in a column. ###,###.## - displays a thousands separator and 2 decimal places. If you type 250000, it will display as 250,000.00 Additionally, you can include any of the following characters in the format code, and they will be displayed exactly as entered. The following spreadsheet shows how you can use a Text formula in Excel to apply different formatting types to the same value. When using the Excel TEXT function with dates and times, you can use any of the following format codes. d - one or two-digit number without a leading zero (1 to 31) dd - two-digit number with a leading zero (01 to 31) dddd - full name of day of week (Monday to Sunday) Month (when used as part of a date) m - one or two-digit number without a leading zero (1 to 12) mm - two-digit number with a leading zero (01 to 12) mmmm - full name of month (January to December) h - one or two-digit number without a leading zero (1 to 24) hh - two-digit number with a leading zero (01 to 24) Minute (when used as part of time) m - one or two-digit number without a leading zero (1 to 60) mm - two-digit number with a leading zero (01 to 60) s - one or two-digit number without a leading zero (1 to 60) ss - two-digit number with a leading zero (01 to 60) Time represented as a 12-hour clock, followed by \"AM\" or \"PM\" The following spreadsheet shows a few Excel Text formulas for dates:\n\nHow to use TEXT function in Excel - formula examples So far, you might have an impression that the use of the Excel TEXT function is quite limited (because a value's display can easily be changed using the Format Cells dialog available via a cell's context menu or Ctrl+1 shortcut). The situation changes as soon as you start using TEXT in combination with other Excel functions. The below examples will give you a few inspirational ideas. Concatenate text and number (or date) in a custom format When creating summary sheets or reports, you may often want not only calculate totals, percentages and the like, but also explain to your users what this or that number means. To do this, use the CONCATENATE function to join text and numbers, and the TEXT function to display the number (or date) like you want it. Supposing you calculate the total amount based on the unit price in cell A2, quantity in B2, and discount percentage in C2 using this calculation: . For your users to know exactly what the output number means, you wish to display it together with some explanatory text like \"Your price is\". Additionally, you want to show the currency symbol, thousands separator and two decimal places. To have it done, supply the above calculation in the 1st argument of the TEXT function, include the corresponding format code in the 2nd argument, and concatenate the Text formula with a string using either the ampersand operator or CONCATENATE function: The following screenshot demonstrates the result: Example 2. Combine text and date in the desired format When you return the current date using TODAY() or NOW() function, you may also want to display it in combination with some text so that no one has any doubt what day this date refers to. However, if you try to concatenate a text and date in the usual way: Excel will return a very odd result, something like \"Today is 42198\". The point is that in the internal Excel system, dates are stored as numbers, and that number appears in a concatenated text string. To fix this, use the TEXT function to display the date the way you want. For example, embedding the TODAY function in the Text formula with the format code \"dddd d mmm, yyyy\" will return a string similar to this: \"Today is Monday 12 Dec, 2016\". The complete formula goes as follows: A few more formula examples can be found here: Concatenate numbers and dates in various formats.\n\n As you know, Microsoft Excel automatically removes leading zeros typed before a number in a cell, which works fine in most situations. But what if you want to keep the preceding zeros? The Excel TEXT function can be an easy solution to pad numbers with leading zeros in a column, even if the original values are not the same length. Simply use the format code containing only zero placeholders like \"0000000\", where the number of zeros corresponds to the number of digits you want to display. For example, to display 7-digit numbers with leading zeros, use this formula (where A2 is the original number): As you can see in the screenshot below, our Excel Text formula adds as many leading zeros as necessary to make a 7-character long string (please remember, the result of the TEXT function in Excel is always a text string, even if it looks like a number). Turning a column of numeric values into telephone numbers may sound like a tricky task, but only until you remember that the Excel TEXT function allows using dashes and parentheses in format codes. So, to display a number in A2 in a traditional US local 7-digit phone format like 123-456, use this formula: If some of the original values may contain a domestic prefix (i.e. there can be both 7-digit or 10-digit numbers), include the following conditional format code to display 10-digit numbers in the (123) 456-789 format: The screenshot below shows this Excel Text formula in action:\n\nCompared to other Excel functions, TEXT is very simple and painless, and you are unlikely to have any difficulties when using it in your spreadsheets. If, against all expectations, a Text formula is not working for you, in most cases it's because of an incorrect format code input in the format_text argument. Here are two most typical issues:\n• The TEXT function returns the #NAME? error if you omit the quotation marks around the format code. For example the formula is incorrect and should be written this way:\n• The TEXT function in Excel is language-specific, and requires using region-specific date and time format codes. For example, the formula that works fine for English users may return the #VALUE error in other locales. In particular, in Germany, you'd need to use the following format codes: \"t\" instead of \"d\" and \"j\" instead of \"y\" because \"day\" in German is \"tag\" and year is \"jahr\"; \"m\"(month) is fine because in German it also begins with \"m\" (monat). So, in German Excel, the above formula will read as follows: . In France, you'd use the \"mm/jj/aa\" format code because \"day\" is \"jour\", \"month\" is \"mois\", and \"year\" is \"an\". Also, please pay attention that in European countries, the List Separator is usually set to semicolon, not comma, and therefore \";\" should be used to separate the formula's arguments. This is how you use TEXT in Excel. If someone wants to have a closer look at the formulas discussed in this tutorial, you are welcome to download the Sample Excel TEXT function worksheet."

        "document": "We have an internal software that exports data reports to Excel, and several of the columns contain dates in the MM/DD/YYYY format. I have a spreadsheet setup where I will copy these exported reports over to, and then I have formulas already setup to look for these dates. The problem currently is that all dates in months 1-9 come in like this: 01/22/2017.\n\nThe formulas do not recognize them until I activate each and every cell, and hit enter, and then it re-formats to: 1/22/2017 and then everything works. Currently I am having to go cell by cell and activate, and hit enter. Simply selecting all of the cells, and changing the formatting to a Date hasn't worked. Is there a faster way around this? I'm open to VBA if it works, however I'm wondering if there is a simpler method I'm missing, or simply a way to get my formulas to recognize the original date formatting.\n\nEDIT: The data is exported from a SQL database. The formulas that need to reference are using <= in reference to week start dates on another sheet. I initially tried having those match this formatting, but because the dates come as General, math operators don't work at that point."

        "document": "Hi,I export a report from SAP to Excel which generates leading zeros in the format mm/dd/yyyy, which Excel doesn't seem to recognize as dates. I changed the Format from whatever the query generated to Date format, so that the filter lists the dates chronologically. But the Sort function still doesn't.Ex: 01/01/2007 shows up before 10/01/2006 when sorted.How can I fix this? I can go into each cell and hit the Enter key, which causes 01/01/2007 to turn into 1/1/2007. But I can't do that for 2000 linesHelp?!"

        "document": "Hey bkatzman,It looks like you had formatted it as text at some point. This can cause issues when you try and change it to something else. Try ChemistB's or:in your first empty column (row 1*), create a formula like:*assuming Row 1 is the first used row*Carry this formula down to the last row that has a date. With all those formulas selected, copy them, and paste values over your date column. Then apply the custom format of m/d/yy. You can then delete the formula's we typed in."

I.E. months like September being listed as 9/1/2023 but I want them to be listed as 09/01/2023\n\nI’m downloading information as a spreadsheet from an online source for my job, then apply the “Filter” option to the column headers\n\nEssentially when I go to organize the information by date, dibble digit months are being listed under the double-digit dates like October, because I assume Excel is reading the 1 in 10 before the 9 (using September and October as examples)"
