        "document": "This chapter describes some things you’ve learned about already in more detail, and adds some new things as well.\n\nThe list data type has some more methods. Here are all of the methods of list objects: Add an item to the end of the list. Similar to . Extend the list by appending all the items from the iterable. Similar to . Insert an item at a given position. The first argument is the index of the element before which to insert, so inserts at the front of the list, and is equivalent to . Remove the first item from the list whose value is equal to x. It raises a if there is no such item. Remove the item at the given position in the list, and return it. If no index is specified, removes and returns the last item in the list. It raises an if the list is empty or the index is outside the list range. Remove all items from the list. Similar to . Return zero-based index in the list of the first item whose value is equal to x. Raises a if there is no such item. The optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in the slice notation and are used to limit the search to a particular subsequence of the list. The returned index is computed relative to the beginning of the full sequence rather than the start argument. Return the number of times x appears in the list. Sort the items of the list in place (the arguments can be used for sort customization, see for their explanation). Reverse the elements of the list in place. Return a shallow copy of the list. Similar to . An example that uses most of the list methods: You might have noticed that methods like , or that only modify the list have no return value printed – they return the default . This is a design principle for all mutable data structures in Python. Another thing you might notice is that not all data can be sorted or compared. For instance, doesn’t sort because integers can’t be compared to strings and can’t be compared to other types. Also, there are some types that don’t have a defined ordering relation. For example, isn’t a valid comparison. The list methods make it very easy to use a list as a stack, where the last element added is the first element retrieved (“last-in, first-out”). To add an item to the top of the stack, use . To retrieve an item from the top of the stack, use without an explicit index. For example: It is also possible to use a list as a queue, where the first element added is the first element retrieved (“first-in, first-out”); however, lists are not efficient for this purpose. While appends and pops from the end of list are fast, doing inserts or pops from the beginning of a list is slow (because all of the other elements have to be shifted by one). To implement a queue, use which was designed to have fast appends and pops from both ends. For example: # The first to arrive now leaves # The second to arrive now leaves List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. Common applications are to make new lists where each element is the result of some operations applied to each member of another sequence or iterable, or to create a subsequence of those elements that satisfy a certain condition. For example, assume we want to create a list of squares, like: Note that this creates (or overwrites) a variable named that still exists after the loop completes. We can calculate the list of squares without any side effects using: which is more concise and readable. A list comprehension consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a clause, then zero or more or clauses. The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the context of the and clauses which follow it. For example, this listcomp combines the elements of two lists if they are not equal: Note how the order of the and statements is the same in both these snippets. If the expression is a tuple (e.g. the in the previous example), it must be parenthesized. # create a new list with the values doubled # apply a function to all the elements # the tuple must be parenthesized, otherwise an error is raised File , line : did you forget parentheses around the comprehension target? # flatten a list using a listcomp with two 'for' List comprehensions can contain complex expressions and nested functions: The initial expression in a list comprehension can be any arbitrary expression, including another list comprehension. Consider the following example of a 3x4 matrix implemented as a list of 3 lists of length 4: The following list comprehension will transpose rows and columns: As we saw in the previous section, the inner list comprehension is evaluated in the context of the that follows it, so this example is equivalent to: which, in turn, is the same as: # the following 3 lines implement the nested listcomp In the real world, you should prefer built-in functions to complex flow statements. The function would do a great job for this use case: See Unpacking Argument Lists for details on the asterisk in this line.\n\nWe saw that lists and strings have many common properties, such as indexing and slicing operations. They are two examples of sequence data types (see Sequence Types — list, tuple, range). Since Python is an evolving language, other sequence data types may be added. There is also another standard sequence data type: the tuple. A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas, for instance: File , line , in : # but they can contain mutable objects: As you see, on output tuples are always enclosed in parentheses, so that nested tuples are interpreted correctly; they may be input with or without surrounding parentheses, although often parentheses are necessary anyway (if the tuple is part of a larger expression). It is not possible to assign to the individual items of a tuple, however it is possible to create tuples which contain mutable objects, such as lists. Though tuples may seem similar to lists, they are often used in different situations and for different purposes. Tuples are immutable, and usually contain a heterogeneous sequence of elements that are accessed via unpacking (see later in this section) or indexing (or even by attribute in the case of ). Lists are mutable, and their elements are usually homogeneous and are accessed by iterating over the list. A special problem is the construction of tuples containing 0 or 1 items: the syntax has some extra quirks to accommodate these. Empty tuples are constructed by an empty pair of parentheses; a tuple with one item is constructed by following a value with a comma (it is not sufficient to enclose a single value in parentheses). Ugly, but effective. For example: The statement is an example of tuple packing: the values , and are packed together in a tuple. The reverse operation is also possible: This is called, appropriately enough, sequence unpacking and works for any sequence on the right-hand side. Sequence unpacking requires that there are as many variables on the left side of the equals sign as there are elements in the sequence. Note that multiple assignment is really just a combination of tuple packing and sequence unpacking.\n\nPython also includes a data type for sets. A set is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements. Basic uses include membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries. Set objects also support mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference. Curly braces or the function can be used to create sets. Note: to create an empty set you have to use , not ; the latter creates an empty dictionary, a data structure that we discuss in the next section. Here is a brief demonstration: # show that duplicates have been removed # Demonstrate set operations on unique letters from two words # letters in a but not in b # letters in a or b or both # letters in both a and b # letters in a or b but not both Similarly to list comprehensions, set comprehensions are also supported:\n\nAnother useful data type built into Python is the dictionary (see Mapping Types — dict). Dictionaries are sometimes found in other languages as “associative memories” or “associative arrays”. Unlike sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys, which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys. Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key. You can’t use lists as keys, since lists can be modified in place using index assignments, slice assignments, or methods like and . It is best to think of a dictionary as a set of key: value pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary). A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary: . Placing a comma-separated list of key:value pairs within the braces adds initial key:value pairs to the dictionary; this is also the way dictionaries are written on output. The main operations on a dictionary are storing a value with some key and extracting the value given the key. It is also possible to delete a key:value pair with . If you store using a key that is already in use, the old value associated with that key is forgotten. It is an error to extract a value using a non-existent key. Performing on a dictionary returns a list of all the keys used in the dictionary, in insertion order (if you want it sorted, just use instead). To check whether a single key is in the dictionary, use the keyword. Here is a small example using a dictionary: The constructor builds dictionaries directly from sequences of key-value pairs: In addition, dict comprehensions can be used to create dictionaries from arbitrary key and value expressions: When the keys are simple strings, it is sometimes easier to specify pairs using keyword arguments:\n\nWhen looping through dictionaries, the key and corresponding value can be retrieved at the same time using the method. When looping through a sequence, the position index and corresponding value can be retrieved at the same time using the function. To loop over two or more sequences at the same time, the entries can be paired with the function. What is your name? It is lancelot. What is your quest? It is the holy grail. What is your favorite color? It is blue. To loop over a sequence in reverse, first specify the sequence in a forward direction and then call the function. To loop over a sequence in sorted order, use the function which returns a new sorted list while leaving the source unaltered. Using on a sequence eliminates duplicate elements. The use of in combination with over a sequence is an idiomatic way to loop over unique elements of the sequence in sorted order. It is sometimes tempting to change a list while you are looping over it; however, it is often simpler and safer to create a new list instead.\n\nThe conditions used in and statements can contain any operators, not just comparisons. The comparison operators and are membership tests that determine whether a value is in (or not in) a container. The operators and compare whether two objects are really the same object. All comparison operators have the same priority, which is lower than that of all numerical operators. Comparisons can be chained. For example, tests whether is less than and moreover equals . Comparisons may be combined using the Boolean operators and , and the outcome of a comparison (or of any other Boolean expression) may be negated with . These have lower priorities than comparison operators; between them, has the highest priority and the lowest, so that A and not B or C is equivalent to (A and (not B)) or C . As always, parentheses can be used to express the desired composition. The Boolean operators and are so-called short-circuit operators: their arguments are evaluated from left to right, and evaluation stops as soon as the outcome is determined. For example, if and are true but is false, A and B and C does not evaluate the expression . When used as a general value and not as a Boolean, the return value of a short-circuit operator is the last evaluated argument. It is possible to assign the result of a comparison or other Boolean expression to a variable. For example, Note that in Python, unlike C, assignment inside expressions must be done explicitly with the walrus operator . This avoids a common class of problems encountered in C programs: typing in an expression when was intended.\n\nSequence objects typically may be compared to other objects with the same sequence type. The comparison uses lexicographical ordering: first the first two items are compared, and if they differ this determines the outcome of the comparison; if they are equal, the next two items are compared, and so on, until either sequence is exhausted. If two items to be compared are themselves sequences of the same type, the lexicographical comparison is carried out recursively. If all items of two sequences compare equal, the sequences are considered equal. If one sequence is an initial sub-sequence of the other, the shorter sequence is the smaller (lesser) one. Lexicographical ordering for strings uses the Unicode code point number to order individual characters. Some examples of comparisons between sequences of the same type: Note that comparing objects of different types with or is legal provided that the objects have appropriate comparison methods. For example, mixed numeric types are compared according to their numeric value, so 0 equals 0.0, etc. Otherwise, rather than providing an arbitrary ordering, the interpreter will raise a exception."

        "document": "A while ago I wrote a guide on how to compare two dictionaries in Python 3, and how this task is not as simple as it might sound. It turns out comparing two lists in Python is just so tricky as comparing s.\n\nThe way we've been taught to compare two objects in Python is a bit misleading. Most books and tutorials teach object comparison by using either the or the operator. In reality, these two operators cover just a small fraction of the most frequent use cases.\n• what if we want to compare a list of floating-point numbers considering a certain tolerance?\n• what if we wish to contrast two lists but ignoring the order in which the elements appear?\n• maybe we need to compare two lists and return the elements that intersect both\n• sometimes we might want to get the difference between two lists\n• what if we have two lists of strings and need to compare them by ignoring the string cases?\n• what if we're given a list of arrays to compare each other, what can we do?\n• or maybe we have a list of custom objects, or a list of dictionaries.\n\nThe list goes on and on, and for all of these use cases using doesn't help.\n\nThat's what we are going to see in this article. We’ll learn the best ways of comparing two lists in Python for several use cases where the operator is not enough.\n\nComparing if two lists are equal in python\n\nThe easiest way to compare two lists for equality is to use the operator. This comparison method works well for simple cases, but as we'll see later, it doesn't work with advanced comparisons.\n\nAn example of a simple case would be a list of or objects.\n\nPretty simple, right? Unfortunately, the world is complex, and so is production grade code. In the real world, things get complicated really fast. As an illustration, consider the following cases.\n\nSuppose you have a list of floating points that is built dynamically. You can add single elements, or elements derived from a mathematical operation such as .\n\nClearly, floating point arithmetic has its limitations, and sometimes we want to compare two lists but ignore precision errors, or even define some tolerance. For cases like this, the operator won’t suffice.\n\nThings can get more complicated if the lists have custom objects or objects from other libraries, such as .\n\nYou might also like to compare the lists and return the matches. Or maybe compare the two lists and return the differences. Or perhaps you want to compare two lists ignoring the duplicates, or compare a list of dictionaries in Python.\n\nIn every single case, using is not the answer, and that's what we are going to see next: how to perform complex comparison operations between two lists in Python.\n\nIn the previous section, we saw that floating point arithmetic can cause precision errors. If we have a list of floats and want to compare it with another list, chances are that the operator won't help.\n\nLet's revisit the example from the previous section and see what is the best way of comparing two lists of floats.\n\nAs you see, , which causes the comparison to fail. Now, how can we do better? Is it even possible?\n\nThere are a few ways of doing approaching this task. One would be to create our own custom function, that iterates over the elements and compare it one by one using the function.\n\nFortunately we don't have to reinvent the wheel. As I showed in the \"how to compare two dicts\" article, we can use a library called for that. This library supports different types of objects and lists are one of them.\n\nThe example below starts off by setting up the two lists we want to compare. We then pass it to the constructor which returns the difference. That's great, the returned value is much more informative than a simple boolean.\n\nSince we want to ignore the precision error, we can set the number of digits AFTER the decimal point to be used in the comparison.\n\nThe result is an empty dict, which means the lists are equal. If we try comparing a list with a float number that differs in more than 3 significant digits, the library will return that diff.\n\nFor reproducibility, in this article I used the latest version of which is .\n\nComparing if two lists without order (unordered lists) are equal\n\nLists in Python are unordered by default. Sometimes we want to compare two lists but treat them as the same as long as they have the same elements—regardless of their order.\n\nThere are two ways of doing this:\n• sorting the lists and using the operator\n• converting them to s and using the operator\n\nThese first two methods assume the elements can be safely compared using the operator. This approach doesn’t work for floating-point numbers, and other complex objects, but as we saw in the previous section, we can use .\n\nSorting the lists and using the operator\n\nYou can sort lists in Python in two different ways:\n\nThe first method sorts a list in place, and that means your list will be modified. It's a good idea to not modify a list in place as it can introduce bugs that are hard to detect.\n\nUsing is better since it returns a new list and keep the original unmodified.\n\nLet's see how it works.\n\nAs a consequence, by sorting the lists first we ensure that both lists will have the same order, and thus can be compared using the operator.\n\nContrary to lists, sets in Python don’t care about order. For example, a set is the same as . As such, we can use this feature to compare the two lists ignoring the elements’ order.\n\nTo do so, we convert each list into a set, then using the to compare them.\n\nThis library also allows us to ignore the order in sequences such as s. By default, it will take the order in consideration, but if we set to , then we're all good. Let's see this in action.\n\nUsing has pros and cons. In the end, it is an external library you need to install, so if you can use a to compare the lists, then stick to it. However, if you have other use cases where it can shine, then I’d go with it.\n\nHow to compare two lists and return matches\n\nIn this section, we'll see how we can compare two lists and find their intersection. In other words, we want to find the values that appear in both.\n\nTo do that, we can once more use a and take their intersection.\n\nHow to compare two lists in python and return differences\n\nWe can the find difference between two lists in python in two different ways:\n\nJust like we did to determine the intersection, we can leverage the data structure to check difference between two lists in python.\n\nIf we want to get all the elements that are present in the first list but not in the second, we can use the .\n\nOn the other hand, if we want to find all the elements that are in either of the lists but not both, then we can use .\n\nThis method has a limitation: it groups what is different between the lists into one final result which is the set difference. What if we want to know which elements in that diff belong to what list?\n\nAs we've seen so far, this library is powerful and it returns a nice diff. Let's see what happens when we use to get the difference between two lists in Python.\n\nAccordingly, returns what changed from one list to the other. The right approach then will depend on your use case. If you want a detailed diff, then use . Otherwise, just use a .\n\nHow to compare two lists of strings\n\nComparing two lists of string in Python depends largely on what type of comparison you want to make. That's because we can compare a string in a handful of ways.\n\nIn this section, we'll see 3 different ways of doing that.\n\nThe simplest one is using a operator, like we saw in the beginning. This method is suitable if you want a strict comparison between each string.\n\nThings start to get messy if you want to compare the list of strings but ignoring the case. Using the for that just doesn't work.\n\nThe best tool for that is again . It allows us to ignore the string by passing a boolean flag to it.\n\nWe can also ignore the order in which the strings appear in the lists.\n\nYou can also go further and perform advanced comparisons by passing a custom operator to .\n\nFor example, suppose you want to compare the strings but ignoring any whitespace they may have.\n\nOr perhaps you want to perform a fuzzy matching using an edit distance metric.\n\nTo do that, we can write the comparison logic in the operator class and pass it to .\n\nIn this first example, we'll ignore any whitespace by trimming the strings before comparing them.\n\nThen we can just plug into by adding it to the list of , like so .\n\nHow to compare two lists of dictionaries\n\nComparing two lists of dictionaries in Python is definitely intricate without the help of an external library. As we've seen so far, is versatile enough and we can use it to compare deep complex objects such as lists of dictionaries.\n\nLet's see what happens when we pass two lists of dictionaries.\n\nIt outputs the exact location where the elements differ and what the difference is!\n\nLet's see another example where a list has a missing element.\n\nIt says the the second dictionary has been removed, which is the case for this example.\n\nHow to compare two list of lists\n\nComparing multidimensional lists—a.k.a list of lists—is easy for . It works just like a list of s.\n\nIn the example below, we have two multidimensional lists that we want to compare. When passed to , it returns the exact location in which the elements differ.\n\nFor example, for the position , the new value is 8, and the old is 3. Another interesting aspect is that it works for deeply nested structures, for instance, also highlights the difference in the position.\n\nWhen feeding the library with two identical multidimensional lists, it returns an empty response.\n\nHow to compare two lists of objects\n\nSometimes we have a list of custom objects that we want to compare. Maybe we want to get a diff, or just check if they contain the same elements. The solution for this problem couldn't be different: use .\n\nThe following example demonstrates the power of this library. We're going to compare two lists containing a custom objects, and we'll be able to assert if they are equal or not and what are the differences.\n\nIn the example below, we have two lists of objects. The only difference between the two is that in the last position object has a different age. not only finds the right position - - but also finds that field is different as well.\n\nHow to compare two lists of numpy arrays\n\nIn this section, we'll see how to compare two lists of arrays. This is a fairly common task for those who work with data science and/or machine learning.\n\nWe saw in the first section that using the operator doesn't work well with lists of arrays. Luckily we can use... guess what!? Yes, we can use .\n\nThe example below shows two lists with different arrays and the library can detect the exact position in which they differ. How cool is that?\n\nIn this post, we saw many ways to compare two lists in Python. The best method depends on what kind of elements we have and how we want to compare. Hopefully, you now know how to:\n• check if two lists are equal in python\n• compare two lists in python and return matches\n• compare two lists in python and return differences\n\nOther posts you may like:\n• None The Best Way to Compare Two Dictionaries in Python\n• None How to Compare Two Strings in Python (in 8 Easy Ways)\n• None 7 Different Ways to Flatten a List of Lists in Python\n\nSee you next time!\n\nThis post was originally published at https://miguendes.me"

        "document": "Loops in Python are used to repeat actions efficiently. The main types are For loops (counting through items) and While loops (based on conditions). Additionally, Nested Loops allow looping within loops for more complex tasks. While all the ways provide similar basic functionality, they differ in their syntax and condition-checking time. In this article, we will look at Python loops and understand their working with the help of examples.\n\nIn Python, a while loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied. When the condition becomes false, the line immediately after the loop in the program is executed.\n\nAll the statements indented by the same number of character spaces after a programming construct are considered to be part of a single block of code. Python uses indentation as its method of grouping statements.\n\nExample of Python While Loop:\n\nUsing else statement with While Loop in Python\n\nElse clause is only executed when our while condition becomes false. If we break out of the loop or if an exception is raised then it won’t be executed.\n\nSyntax of While Loop with else statement:\n\nThe code prints “Hello Geek” three times using a ‘while’ loop and then after the loop it prints “In Else Block” because there is an “else” block associated with the ‘while’ loop.\n\nIf we want a block of code to execute infinite number of times then we can use the while loop in Python to do so.\n\nThe code given below uses a ‘while’ loop with the condition (count == 0) and this loop will only run as long as count is equal to 0. Since count is initially set to 0, the loop will execute indefinitely because the condition is always true.\n\nNote: It is suggested not to use this type of loop as it is a never-ending infinite loop where the condition is always true and we have to forcefully terminate the compiler.\n\nFor loops are used for sequential traversal. For example: traversing a list or string or array etc. In Python, there is “for in” loop which is similar to foreach loop in other languages. Let us learn how to use for loops in Python for sequential traversals with examples.\n\nExplanation: This code prints the numbers from 0 to 3 (inclusive) using a for loop that iterates over a range from 0 to n-1 (where n = 4).\n\nExample with List, Tuple, String, and Dictionary Iteration Using for Loops in Python\n\nWe can use for loop to iterate lists, tuples, strings and dictionaries in Python.\n\nIterating by the Index of Sequences\n\nWe can also use the index of elements in the sequence to iterate. The key idea is to first calculate the length of the list and in iterate over the sequence within the range of this length.\n\nExplanation: This code iterates through each element of the list using its index and prints each element one by one. The range(len(list)) generates indices from 0 to the length of the list minus 1.\n\nUsing else Statement with for Loop in Python\n\nWe can also combine else statement with for loop like in while loop. But as there is no condition in for loop based on which the execution will terminate so the else block will be executed immediately after for block finishes execution.\n\nExplanation: The code iterates through the list and prints each element. After the loop ends it prints “Inside Else Block” as the else block executes when the loop completes without a break.\n\nPython programming language allows to use one loop inside another loop which is called nested loop. Following section shows few examples to illustrate the concept.\n\nThe syntax for a nested while loop statement in the Python programming language is as follows:\n\nA final note on loop nesting is that we can put any type of loop inside of any other type of loops in Python. For example, a for loop can be inside a while loop or vice versa.\n\nExplanation: In the above code we use nested loops to print the value of i multiple times in each row, where the number of times it prints i increases with each iteration of the outer loop. The print() function prints the value of i and moves to the next line after each row.\n\nLoop control statements change execution from their normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed. Python supports the following control statements.\n\nThe continue statement in Python returns the control to the beginning of the loop.\n\nExplanation: The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It is useful when we want to bypass certain conditions without terminating the loop.\n\nThe break statement in Python brings control out of the loop.\n\nExplanation: break statement is used to exit the loop prematurely when a specified condition is met. In this example, the loop breaks when the letter is either ‘e’ or ‘s’, stopping further iteration.\n\nWe use pass statement in Python to write empty loops. Pass is also used for empty control statements, functions and classes.\n\nExplanation: In this example, the loop iterates over each letter in ‘geeksforgeeks’ but doesn’t perform any operation, and after the loop finishes, the last letter (‘s’) is printed.\n\nHow for loop works internally in Python?\n\nBefore proceeding to this section, we should have a prior understanding of Python Iterators.\n\nFirstly, lets see how a simple for loops in Python looks like.\n\nExample: This Python code iterates through a list called fruits, containing “apple”, “orange” and “kiwi.” It prints each fruit name on a separate line, displaying them in the order they appear in the list.\n\nThis code iterates over each item in the fruits list and prints the item (fruit) on each iteration and the output will display each fruit on a new line.\n\nThis Python code manually iterates through a list of fruits using an iterator. It prints each fruit’s name one by one and stops when there are no more items in the list.\n\nWe can see that under the hood we are calling iter() and next() method.\n• None Difference between for loop and while loop in Python\n• None Use for Loop That Loops Over a Sequence in Python\n\nWhich loop is faster in Python?\n\nWhy is Python slow in loops?\n\nHow many loops are used in Python?\n\nIs for loop bad in Python?"
