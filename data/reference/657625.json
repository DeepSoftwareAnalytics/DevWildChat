If a WHERE clause is supplied, then only those rows for which the WHERE clause boolean expression is true are deleted. Rows for which the expression is false or NULL are retained.\n\nThe following restrictions apply to DELETE statements that occur within the body of a CREATE TRIGGER statement:\n• None The table-name specified as part of a DELETE statement within a trigger body must be unqualified. In other words, the schema-name. prefix on the table name is not allowed within triggers. If the table to which the trigger is attached is not in the temp database, then DELETE statements within the trigger body must operate on tables within the same database as it. If the table to which the trigger is attached is in the TEMP database, then the unqualified name of the table being deleted is resolved in the same way as it is for a top-level statement (by searching first the TEMP database, then the main database, then any other databases in the order they were attached).\n• None The INDEXED BY and NOT INDEXED clauses are not allowed on DELETE statements within triggers.\n• None The LIMIT and ORDER BY clauses (described below) are unsupported for DELETE statements within triggers.\n• None The RETURNING clause is not supported for triggers.\n\nIf SQLite is compiled with the SQLITE_ENABLE_UPDATE_DELETE_LIMIT compile-time option, then the syntax of the DELETE statement is extended by the addition of optional ORDER BY and LIMIT clauses:\n\nIf a DELETE statement has a LIMIT clause, the maximum number of rows that will be deleted is found by evaluating the accompanying expression and casting it to an integer value. If the result of the evaluating the LIMIT clause cannot be losslessly converted to an integer value, it is an error. A negative LIMIT value is interpreted as \"no limit\". If the DELETE statement also has an OFFSET clause, then it is similarly evaluated and cast to an integer value. Again, it is an error if the value cannot be losslessly converted to an integer. If there is no OFFSET clause, or the calculated integer value is negative, the effective OFFSET value is zero.\n\nIf the DELETE statement has an ORDER BY clause, then all rows that would be deleted in the absence of the LIMIT clause are sorted according to the ORDER BY. The first M rows, where M is the value found by evaluating the OFFSET clause expression, are skipped, and the following N, where N is the value of the LIMIT expression, are deleted. If there are less than N rows remaining after taking the OFFSET clause into account, or if the LIMIT clause evaluated to a negative value, then all remaining rows are deleted.\n\nIf the DELETE statement has no ORDER BY clause, then all rows that would be deleted in the absence of the LIMIT clause are assembled in an arbitrary order before applying the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses to determine the subset that are actually deleted.\n\nThe ORDER BY clause on a DELETE statement is used only to determine which rows fall within the LIMIT. The order in which rows are deleted is arbitrary and is not influenced by the ORDER BY clause. This means that if there is a RETURNING clause, the rows returned by the statement probably will not be in the order specified by the ORDER BY clause.\n\nWhen the WHERE clause and RETURNING clause are both omitted from a DELETE statement and the table being deleted has no triggers, SQLite uses an optimization to erase the entire table content without having to visit each row of the table individually. This \"truncate\" optimization makes the delete run much faster. Prior to SQLite version 3.6.5 (2008-11-12), the truncate optimization also meant that the sqlite3_changes() and sqlite3_total_changes() interfaces and the count_changes pragma will not actually return the number of deleted rows. That problem has been fixed as of version 3.6.5 (2008-11-12).\n\nThe truncate optimization can be permanently disabled for all queries by recompiling SQLite with the SQLITE_OMIT_TRUNCATE_OPTIMIZATION compile-time switch.\n\nThe truncate optimization can also be disabled at runtime using the sqlite3_set_authorizer() interface. If an authorizer callback returns SQLITE_IGNORE for an SQLITE_DELETE action code, then the DELETE operation will proceed but the truncate optimization will be bypassed and rows will be deleted one by one."

        "document": "Summary: this tutorial shows you how to use SQLite statement to remove rows from a table.\n\nYou have learned how to insert a new row into a table and update existing data of a table. Sometimes, you need to remove rows from a table. In this case, you use SQLite statement.\n\nThe SQLite statement allows you to delete one row, multiple rows, and all rows in a table. The syntax of the SQLite statement is as follows:\n• First, specify the name of the table which you want to remove rows after the keywords.\n• Second, add a search condition in the clause to identify the rows to remove. The clause is an optional part of the statement. If you omit the clause, the statement will delete all rows in the table.\n\nSQLite also provides an extension to the statement by adding and clauses. If you compile SQLite with the SQLITE_ENABLE_UPDATE_DELETE_LIMIT compile-time option, you can use the and clause in the statement like the following form:\n\nThe clause sorts the rows filtered by the preceding in the clause and the clause specifies the number of rows that to be deleted.\n\nNotice that when you use the statement without a clause on a table that has no triggers. SQLite will delete all rows in one shot instead of visiting and deleting each individual row. This feature is known as truncate optimization.\n\nWe will use the table created in the how to insert rows into table tutorial.\n\nIf you did not follow that tutorial, you can create the table and insert data into it using the following script:\n\nThe following statement returns all rows from the table:\n\nWe have 280 rows in the table.\n\nTo remove an artist with id 1, you use the following statement:\n\nBecause we use to identify the artist, the statement removed exactly 1 row.\n\nSuppose you want to delete artists whose names contain the word :\n\nThere are 9 rows whose values in the column contain the word therefore, these 9 rows were deleted.\n\nTo remove all rows in the table, you just need to omit the clause as the following statement:\n\nIn this tutorial, you have learned how to use SQLite statement to remove rows in a table."

        "document": "The RETURNING clause is not a statement itself, but a clause that can optionally appear near the end of top-level DELETE, INSERT, and UPDATE statements. The effect of the RETURNING clause is to cause the statement to return one result row for each database row that is deleted, inserted, or updated. RETURNING is not standard SQL. It is an extension. SQLite's syntax for RETURNING is modelled after PostgreSQL.\n\nThe RETURNING syntax has been supported by SQLite since version 3.35.0 (2021-03-12).\n\nThe RETURNING clause is designed to provide the application with the values of columns that are filled in automatically by SQLite. For example:\n\nIn the INSERT statement above, SQLite computes the values for all three columns. The RETURNING clause causes SQLite to report the chosen values back to the application. This saves the application from having to issue a separate query to figure out exactly what values were inserted.\n\nThe RETURNING clause is followed by a comma-separated list of expressions. These expressions are similar to the expressions following the SELECT keyword in a SELECT statement in that they define the values of the columns in the result set. Each expression defines the value for a single column. Each expression may be optionally followed by an AS clause that determines the name of the result column. The special \"*\" expression expands into a list of all non-hidden columns of the table being deleted, inserted, or updated.\n\nFor INSERT and UPDATE statements, references to columns in the table being modified refer to the value of that column after the change has been applied. For DELETE statements, references to columns mean the value before the delete occurs.\n\nThe RETURNING clause only returns rows that are directly modified by the DELETE, INSERT, or UPDATE statement. The RETURNING clause does not report any additional database changes caused by foreign key constraints or triggers.\n\nA RETURNING clause for an UPSERT reports both inserted and updated rows.\n\nWhen a DELETE, INSERT, or UPDATE statement with a RETURNING clause is run, all of the database changes occur during the first invocation of sqlite3_step(). The RETURNING clause output is accumulated in memory. The first sqlite3_step() call returns one row of RETURNING output and subsequent rows of RETURNING output are returned by subsequent calls to sqlite3_step(). To put this another way, all RETURNING clause output is embargoed until after all database modification actions are completed.\n\nThis means that if a statement has a RETURNING clause that generates a large amount of output, either many rows or large string or BLOB values, then the statement might use a lot of temporary memory to hold those values while it is running.\n\nWhile SQLite does guarantee that all database changes will occur before any RETURNING output is emitted, it does not guarantee that the order of individual RETURNING rows will match the order in which those rows were changed in the database. The output order for the RETURNING rows is arbitrary and is not necessarily related to the order in which the rows were processed internally.\n\nSQLite guarantees that all database changes will occur before any RETURNING output is emitted, but SQLite makes no guarantees about the order in which database changes occur nor when the RETURNING output is computed in relation to those database changes. RETURNING clause outputs are all computed and placed in temporary storage during the first call to sqlite3_step() but the specific order of when those output are computed and the order in which database changes occur is unspecified. The order can change from one query to the next.\n\nHence if column of RETURNING output contains a subquery that references the table being modified, then the result of that subquery might depend on unspecified behavior and hence could vary from one invocation of the query to the next.\n\nWhen the previous \"Processing Order\" section says that \"database changes occur during the first invocation of sqlite3_step()\", that means that the changes are stored in the private page cache of the database connection that is running the statement. It does not mean that the changes are actually committed. The commit does not occur until the statement finishes, and maybe not even then if the statement is part of a larger transaction. Changes to the database are still atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID). When the previous section says \"changes occur\", this means that internal data structures are adjusted pending a transaction commit. Some of those changes may or may not spill into the write-ahead log, depending on how much pressure there is on the page cache. If the page cache is not under memory pressure, then probably nothing will be written to disk until after the transaction completes, which is after sqlite3_step() returns SQLITE_DONE.\n\nIn other words, when the previous section says \"database changes occur\", that means that the changes occur in the memory of the specific database connection that is running the statement, not that the changes are written to disk.\n• None The RETURNING clause is not available on DELETE and UPDATE statements against virtual tables. This limitation might be removed in future versions of SQLite.\n• None The RETURNING clause is only available in top-level DELETE, INSERT, and UPDATE statements. The RETURNING clause cannot be used by statements within triggers.\n• None Even though a DML statement with a RETURNING clause returns table content, it cannot be used as a subquery. The RETURNING clause can only return data to the application. It is not currently possible to divert the RETURNING output into another table or query. PostgreSQL has the ability to use a DML statement with a RETURNING clause like a view in a common table expressions. SQLite does not currently have that ability, though that is something that might be added in a future release.\n• None The rows emitted by the RETURNING clause appear in an arbitrary order. That order might change depending on the database schema, upon the specific release of SQLite used, or even from one execution of the same statement to the next. There is no way to cause the output rows to appear in a particular order. Even if SQLite is compiled with the SQLITE_ENABLE_UPDATE_DELETE_LIMIT option such that ORDER BY clauses are allowed on DELETE and UPDATE statements, those ORDER BY clauses do not constrain the output order of RETURNING.\n• None The values emitted by the RETURNING clause are the values as seen by the top-level DELETE, INSERT, or UPDATE statement and do not reflect any subsequent value changes made by triggers. Thus, if the database includes AFTER triggers that modifies some of the values of each row inserted or updated, the RETURNING clause emits the original values that are computed before those triggers run.\n• None The RETURNING clause may not contain top-level aggregate functions or window functions. If there are subqueries in the RETURNING clause, those subqueries may contain aggregates and window functions, but aggregates cannot occur at the top level.\n• None The RETURNING clause may only reference the table being modified. In an UPDATE FROM statement, the auxiliary tables named in the FROM clause may not participate in the RETURNING clause.\n\nThis page last modified on 2024-05-08 20:36:57 UTC"

        "document": "Duplicate rows in a database can be a nuisance. They can distort your data, cause confusion, and affect the performance of your queries. If you’re working with an SQLite database and want to eliminate these duplicates, you’ve come to the right place. In this blog post, ’ll walk you through the process of removing duplicate rows from an SQLite database, referencing a practical example with a table schema.\n\nBefore diving into the technicalities, let’s first understand the challenge. Duplicate rows are often created unintentionally, and they occur when there are multiple entries with identical values in one or more columns of a table. The key to solving this issue is to identify and preserve one instance of each unique entry while removing the rest.\n\nLet’s start with the table schema we’ll be using for this tutorial. We have a table called “jobs” with the following columns:\n\nOur goal is to remove duplicate rows based on the values in the “project_id” column. The “project_id” column will serve as our unique identifier to distinguish between rows.\n\nTo identify duplicate rows in the “jobs” table, we’ll use a SQL query that groups the rows by the “project_id” column and selects the minimum ROWID for each group. The ROWID is a unique identifier for each row in SQLite. Here’s the query:\n\nThis query selects the minimum ROWID for each unique “project_id” value, effectively identifying the rows you want to keep.\n\nWith the duplicates identified, it’s time to remove them from the “jobs” table. We’ll use a DELETE statement with a WHERE clause that specifies we want to keep rows where the ROWID is in the list obtained from the previous query. Here’s the query:\n\nThis DELETE statement ensures that only one instance of each unique “project_id” value remains in the table, effectively removing the duplicates.\n\nPutting It All Together\n\nTo make it easier to follow, let’s combine these steps into a single SQL query:\n\nBy executing this query, you will successfully remove duplicate rows based on the “project_id” column, preserving only one instance of each unique “project_id.”\n\nRemoving duplicate rows from an SQLite database can help you maintain clean and accurate data, ensuring that your queries and analyses yield meaningful results. Using the example table schema and the steps outlined in this blog post, you can efficiently eliminate duplicates in your database. Remember to adapt the column names and table names to your specific database schema. Keep your data clean and precise, and your SQLite database will perform at its best!"

        "document": "SQLite is an open-source and serverless database system that does not require any server to perform various queries also it is widely used in the development of embedded software like television and mobile phones Sometimes it might happen that we by mistake insert multiple times similar data into tables which leads to the problem of inconsistency and data integrity. In this article, we will learn about How to delete duplicate rows in SQLite with its syntax examples and so on.\n\nBefore understanding how to perform operations on duplicate row deletion we must have familiarity with SQLite fundamentals and basic SQL commands like SELECT, DELETE and GROUP BY.\n\nDuplicate rows in an SQLite database are defined as multiple records within a table that have the same values in one or more columns. These duplicates can arise due to various reasons, such as data entry errors, inconsistencies in data sources or incomplete data normalization processes. Identifying and managing duplicate rows is important for maintaining data integrity and ensuring efficient database operations. we will learn how to remove duplicate records from the table easily.\n\nExplanation: This SQL query deletes duplicate rows from the \"students\" table by retaining only the records with the minimum \"rowid\" for each unique combination of \"first_name\" and \"last_name\". It ensures that only the earliest entry for each distinct student name combination is preserved, effectively eliminating duplicate entries\n\nBy following these steps, we'll effectively declutter our database and ensure that each piece of data is unique, just like ensuring each book on the shelf is distinct. This process not only improves data organization but also enhances the efficiency and performance of our database operations.\n\nExamples of How to Delete Duplicate Rows in SQLite\n\nWe have a table of employee names and salaries. Some names are repeated.\n\nLet's delete the duplicate rows form the employees table then check the table.\n• None We're identifying duplicate employee names and keeping only the earliest-hired employee with that name.\n• None The DELETE statement removes the excess copies, leaving us with a neat and organized employee list.\n\nWe have a table of student names, last names, and ages. Some names are repeated.\n\nLet's delete the duplicate rows form students the table then check the table.\n• None We're identifying duplicate student names and retaining only the records of the oldest students with the same name.\n• None statement removes the redundant student entries, leaving us with a concise and organized student database.\n\nOverall, In this article we have learned about how to delete duplicate rows when table consists multiple duplicates rows to ensure the data integrity and consistency With the help of command such as DELETE and GROUP BY which we learned above in the article will remove redundant entries effectively. By understanding these method allow the developers can fast database maintenance tasks, improve data organization also ensure the accuracy of their applications data."
