        "document": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is one of the hottest areas of artificial intelligence (AI) thanks to applications like text generators that compose coherent essays, chatbots that fool people into thinking they’re sentient, and text-to-image programs that produce photorealistic images of anything you can describe. Recent years have brought a revolution in the ability of computers to understand human languages, programming languages, and even biological and chemical sequences, such as DNA and protein structures, that resemble language. The latest AI models are unlocking these areas to analyze the meanings of input text and generate meaningful, expressive output.\n\nNatural language processing (NLP) is the discipline of building machines that can manipulate human language — or data that resembles human language — in the way that it is written, spoken, and organized. It evolved from computational linguistics, which uses computer science to understand the principles of language, but rather than developing theoretical frameworks, NLP is an engineering discipline that seeks to build technology to accomplish useful tasks. NLP can be divided into two overlapping subfields: natural language understanding (NLU), which focuses on semantic analysis or determining the intended meaning of text, and natural language generation (NLG), which focuses on text generation by a machine. NLP is separate from — but often used in conjunction with — speech recognition, which seeks to parse spoken language into words, turning sound into text and vice versa.\n\nNLP is an integral part of everyday life and becoming more so as language technology is applied to diverse fields like retailing (for instance, in customer service chatbots) and medicine (interpreting or summarizing electronic health records). Conversational agents such as Amazon’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri utilize NLP to listen to user queries and find answers. The most sophisticated such agents — such as GPT-3, which was recently opened for commercial applications — can generate sophisticated prose on a wide variety of topics as well as power chatbots that are capable of holding coherent conversations. Google uses NLP to improve its search engine results, and social networks like Facebook use it to detect and filter hate speech.\n\nNLP is growing increasingly sophisticated, yet much work remains to be done. Current systems are prone to bias and incoherence, and occasionally behave erratically. Despite the challenges, machine learning engineers have many opportunities to apply NLP in ways that are ever more central to a functioning society.\n\nWhat is Natural Language Processing (NLP) Used For?\n\nNLP is used for a wide variety of language-related tasks, including answering questions, classifying text in a variety of ways, and conversing with users.\n\nHere are 11 tasks that can be solved by NLP:\n• Sentiment analysis is the process of classifying the emotional intent of text. Generally, the input to a sentiment classification model is a piece of text, and the output is the probability that the sentiment expressed is positive, negative, or neutral. Typically, this probability is based on either hand-generated features, word n-grams, TF-IDF features, or using deep learning models to capture sequential long- and short-term dependencies. Sentiment analysis is used to classify customer reviews on various online platforms as well as for niche applications like identifying signs of mental illness in online comments.\n• Toxicity classification is a branch of sentiment analysis where the aim is not just to classify hostile intent but also to classify particular categories such as threats, insults, obscenities, and hatred towards certain identities. The input to such a model is text, and the output is generally the probability of each class of toxicity. Toxicity classification models can be used to moderate and improve online conversations by silencing offensive comments, detecting hate speech, or scanning documents for defamation.\n• Machine translation automates translation between different languages. The input to such a model is text in a specified source language, and the output is the text in a specified target language. Google Translate is perhaps the most famous mainstream application. Such models are used to improve communication between people on social-media platforms such as Facebook or Skype. Effective approaches to machine translation can distinguish between words with similar meanings. Some systems also perform language identification; that is, classifying text as being in one language or another.\n• Named entity recognition aims to extract entities in a piece of text into predefined categories such as personal names, organizations, locations, and quantities. The input to such a model is generally text, and the output is the various named entities along with their start and end positions. Named entity recognition is useful in applications such as summarizing news articles and combating disinformation. For example, here is what a named entity recognition model could provide:\n• Spam detection is a prevalent binary classification problem in NLP, where the purpose is to classify emails as either spam or not. Spam detectors take as input an email text along with various other subtexts like title and sender’s name. They aim to output the probability that the mail is spam. Email providers like Gmail use such models to provide a better user experience by detecting unsolicited and unwanted emails and moving them to a designated spam folder.\n• Grammatical error correction models encode grammatical rules to correct the grammar within text. This is viewed mainly as a sequence-to-sequence task, where a model is trained on an ungrammatical sentence as input and a correct sentence as output. Online grammar checkers like Grammarly and word-processing systems like Microsoft Word use such systems to provide a better writing experience to their customers. Schools also use them to grade student essays.\n• Topic modeling is an unsupervised text mining task that takes a corpus of documents and discovers abstract topics within that corpus. The input to a topic model is a collection of documents, and the output is a list of topics that defines words for each topic as well as assignment proportions of each topic in a document. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), one of the most popular topic modeling techniques, tries to view a document as a collection of topics and a topic as a collection of words. Topic modeling is being used commercially to help lawyers find evidence in legal documents.\n• Text generation, more formally known as natural language generation (NLG), produces text that’s similar to human-written text. Such models can be fine-tuned to produce text in different genres and formats — including tweets, blogs, and even computer code. Text generation has been performed using Markov processes, LSTMs, BERT, GPT-2, LaMDA, and other approaches. It’s particularly useful for autocomplete and chatbots.\n• Autocomplete predicts what word comes next, and autocomplete systems of varying complexity are used in chat applications like WhatsApp. Google uses autocomplete to predict search queries. One of the most famous models for autocomplete is GPT-2, which has been used to write articles, song lyrics, and much more.\n• Chatbots automate one side of a conversation while a human conversant generally supplies the other side. They can be divided into the following two categories:\n• Database query: We have a database of questions and answers, and we would like a user to query it using natural language.\n• Conversation generation: These chatbots can simulate dialogue with a human partner. Some are capable of engaging in wide-ranging conversations. A high-profile example is Google’s LaMDA, which provided such human-like answers to questions that one of its developers was convinced that it had feelings.\n• Information retrieval finds the documents that are most relevant to a query. This is a problem every search and recommendation system faces. The goal is not to answer a particular query but to retrieve, from a collection of documents that may be numbered in the millions, a set that is most relevant to the query. Document retrieval systems mainly execute two processes: indexing and matching. In most modern systems, indexing is done by a vector space model through Two-Tower Networks, while matching is done using similarity or distance scores. Google recently integrated its search function with a multimodal information retrieval model that works with text, image, and video data.\n• Summarization is the task of shortening text to highlight the most relevant information. Researchers at Salesforce developed a summarizer that also evaluates factual consistency to ensure that its output is accurate. Summarization is divided into two method classes:\n• Extractive summarization focuses on extracting the most important sentences from a long text and combining these to form a summary. Typically, extractive summarization scores each sentence in an input text and then selects several sentences to form the summary.\n• Abstractive summarization produces a summary by paraphrasing. This is similar to writing the abstract that includes words and sentences that are not present in the original text. Abstractive summarization is usually modeled as a sequence-to-sequence task, where the input is a long-form text and the output is a summary.\n• Question answering deals with answering questions posed by humans in a natural language. One of the most notable examples of question answering was Watson, which in 2011 played the television game-show Jeopardy against human champions and won by substantial margins. Generally, question-answering tasks come in two flavors:\n• Multiple choice: The multiple-choice question problem is composed of a question and a set of possible answers. The learning task is to pick the correct answer.\n• Open domain: In open-domain question answering, the model provides answers to questions in natural language without any options provided, often by querying a large number of texts.\n\nNLP models work by finding relationships between the constituent parts of language — for example, the letters, words, and sentences found in a text dataset. NLP architectures use various methods for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and modeling. Some of these processes are:\n• Data preprocessing: Before a model processes text for a specific task, the text often needs to be preprocessed to improve model performance or to turn words and characters into a format the model can understand. Data-centric AI is a growing movement that prioritizes data preprocessing. Various techniques may be used in this data preprocessing:\n• Stemming and lemmatization: Stemming is an informal process of converting words to their base forms using heuristic rules. For example, “university,” “universities,” and “university’s” might all be mapped to the base univers. (One limitation in this approach is that “universe” may also be mapped to univers, even though universe and university don’t have a close semantic relationship.) Lemmatization is a more formal way to find roots by analyzing a word’s morphology using vocabulary from a dictionary. Stemming and lemmatization are provided by libraries like spaCy and NLTK.\n• Sentence segmentation breaks a large piece of text into linguistically meaningful sentence units. This is obvious in languages like English, where the end of a sentence is marked by a period, but it is still not trivial. A period can be used to mark an abbreviation as well as to terminate a sentence, and in this case, the period should be part of the abbreviation token itself. The process becomes even more complex in languages, such as ancient Chinese, that don’t have a delimiter that marks the end of a sentence.\n• Stop word removal aims to remove the most commonly occurring words that don’t add much information to the text. For example, “the,” “a,” “an,” and so on.\n• Tokenization splits text into individual words and word fragments. The result generally consists of a word index and tokenized text in which words may be represented as numerical tokens for use in various deep learning methods. A method that instructs language models to ignore unimportant tokens can improve efficiency.\n• Feature extraction: Most conventional machine-learning techniques work on the features – generally numbers that describe a document in relation to the corpus that contains it – created by either Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, or generic feature engineering such as document length, word polarity, and metadata (for instance, if the text has associated tags or scores). More recent techniques include Word2Vec, GLoVE, and learning the features during the training process of a neural network.\n• Bag-of-Words: Bag-of-Words counts the number of times each word or n-gram (combination of n words) appears in a document. For example, below, the Bag-of-Words model creates a numerical representation of the dataset based on how many of each word in the word_index occur in the document.\n• TF-IDF: In Bag-of-Words, we count the occurrence of each word or n-gram in a document. In contrast, with TF-IDF, we weight each word by its importance. To evaluate a word’s significance, we consider two things:\n• Term Frequency: How important is the word in the document?\n\nTF(word in a document)= Number of occurrences of that word in document / Number of words in document\n• Inverse Document Frequency: How important is the term in the whole corpus?\n\nIDF(word in a corpus)=log(number of documents in the corpus / number of documents that include the word)\n\nA word is important if it occurs many times in a document. But that creates a problem. Words like “a” and “the” appear often. And as such, their TF score will always be high. We resolve this issue by using Inverse Document Frequency, which is high if the word is rare and low if the word is common across the corpus. The TF-IDF score of a term is the product of TF and IDF.\n• Word2Vec, introduced in 2013, uses a vanilla neural network to learn high-dimensional word embeddings from raw text. It comes in two variations: Skip-Gram, in which we try to predict surrounding words given a target word, and Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW), which tries to predict the target word from surrounding words. After discarding the final layer after training, these models take a word as input and output a word embedding that can be used as an input to many NLP tasks. Embeddings from Word2Vec capture context. If particular words appear in similar contexts, their embeddings will be similar.\n• GLoVE is similar to Word2Vec as it also learns word embeddings, but it does so by using matrix factorization techniques rather than neural learning. The GLoVE model builds a matrix based on the global word-to-word co-occurrence counts.\n• Modeling: After data is preprocessed, it is fed into an NLP architecture that models the data to accomplish a variety of tasks.\n• Numerical features extracted by the techniques described above can be fed into various models depending on the task at hand. For example, for classification, the output from the TF-IDF vectorizer could be provided to logistic regression, naive Bayes, decision trees, or gradient boosted trees. Or, for named entity recognition, we can use hidden Markov models along with n-grams.\n• Deep neural networks typically work without using extracted features, although we can still use TF-IDF or Bag-of-Words features as an input.\n• Language Models: In very basic terms, the objective of a language model is to predict the next word when given a stream of input words. Probabilistic models that use Markov assumption are one example:\n\nDeep learning is also used to create such language models. Deep-learning models take as input a word embedding and, at each time state, return the probability distribution of the next word as the probability for every word in the dictionary. Pre-trained language models learn the structure of a particular language by processing a large corpus, such as Wikipedia. They can then be fine-tuned for a particular task. For instance, BERT has been fine-tuned for tasks ranging from fact-checking to writing headlines.\n\nMost of the NLP tasks discussed above can be modeled by a dozen or so general techniques. It’s helpful to think of these techniques in two categories: Traditional machine learning methods and deep learning methods.\n• Logistic regression is a supervised classification algorithm that aims to predict the probability that an event will occur based on some input. In NLP, logistic regression models can be applied to solve problems such as sentiment analysis, spam detection, and toxicity classification.\n• Naive Bayes is a supervised classification algorithm that finds the conditional probability distribution P(label | text) using the following Bayes formula:\n\nand predicts based on which joint distribution has the highest probability. The naive assumption in the Naive Bayes model is that the individual words are independent. Thus:\n\nIn NLP, such statistical methods can be applied to solve problems such as spam detection or finding bugs in software code.\n• Decision trees are a class of supervised classification models that split the dataset based on different features to maximize information gain in those splits.\n• Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is used for topic modeling. LDA tries to view a document as a collection of topics and a topic as a collection of words. LDA is a statistical approach. The intuition behind it is that we can describe any topic using only a small set of words from the corpus.\n• Hidden Markov models: Markov models are probabilistic models that decide the next state of a system based on the current state. For example, in NLP, we might suggest the next word based on the previous word. We can model this as a Markov model where we might find the transition probabilities of going from word1 to word2, that is, P(word1|word2). Then we can use a product of these transition probabilities to find the probability of a sentence. The hidden Markov model (HMM) is a probabilistic modeling technique that introduces a hidden state to the Markov model. A hidden state is a property of the data that isn’t directly observed. HMMs are used for part-of-speech (POS) tagging where the words of a sentence are the observed states and the POS tags are the hidden states. The HMM adds a concept called emission probability; the probability of an observation given a hidden state. In the prior example, this is the probability of a word, given its POS tag. HMMs assume that this probability can be reversed: Given a sentence, we can calculate the part-of-speech tag from each word based on both how likely a word was to have a certain part-of-speech tag and the probability that a particular part-of-speech tag follows the part-of-speech tag assigned to the previous word. In practice, this is solved using the Viterbi algorithm.\n• Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): The idea of using a CNN to classify text was first presented in the paper “Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification” by Yoon Kim. The central intuition is to see a document as an image. However, instead of pixels, the input is sentences or documents represented as a matrix of words.\n• Recurrent Neural Network (RNN): Many techniques for text classification that use deep learning process words in close proximity using n-grams or a window (CNNs). They can see “New York” as a single instance. However, they can’t capture the context provided by a particular text sequence. They don’t learn the sequential structure of the data, where every word is dependent on the previous word or a word in the previous sentence. RNNs remember previous information using hidden states and connect it to the current task. The architectures known as Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and long short-term memory (LSTM) are types of RNNs designed to remember information for an extended period. Moreover, the bidirectional LSTM/GRU keeps contextual information in both directions, which is helpful in text classification. RNNs have also been used to generate mathematical proofs and translate human thoughts into words.\n• Autoencoders are deep learning encoder-decoders that approximate a mapping from X to X, i.e., input=output. They first compress the input features into a lower-dimensional representation (sometimes called a latent code, latent vector, or latent representation) and learn to reconstruct the input. The representation vector can be used as input to a separate model, so this technique can be used for dimensionality reduction. Among specialists in many other fields, geneticists have applied autoencoders to spot mutations associated with diseases in amino acid sequences.\n• Encoder-decoder sequence-to-sequence: The encoder-decoder seq2seq architecture is an adaptation to autoencoders specialized for translation, summarization, and similar tasks. The encoder encapsulates the information in a text into an encoded vector. Unlike an autoencoder, instead of reconstructing the input from the encoded vector, the decoder’s task is to generate a different desired output, like a translation or summary.\n• Transformers: The transformer, a model architecture first described in the 2017 paper “Attention Is All You Need” (Vaswani, Shazeer, Parmar, et al.), forgoes recurrence and instead relies entirely on a self-attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. Since this mechanism processes all words at once (instead of one at a time) that decreases training speed and inference cost compared to RNNs, especially since it is parallelizable. The transformer architecture has revolutionized NLP in recent years, leading to models including BLOOM, Jurassic-X, and Turing-NLG. It has also been successfully applied to a variety of different vision tasks, including making 3D images.\n\nOver the years, many NLP models have made waves within the AI community, and some have even made headlines in the mainstream news. The most famous of these have been chatbots and language models. Here are some of them:\n• Eliza was developed in the mid-1960s to try to solve the Turing Test; that is, to fool people into thinking they’re conversing with another human being rather than a machine. Eliza used pattern matching and a series of rules without encoding the context of the language.\n• Tay was a chatbot that Microsoft launched in 2016. It was supposed to tweet like a teen and learn from conversations with real users on Twitter. The bot adopted phrases from users who tweeted sexist and racist comments, and Microsoft deactivated it not long afterward. Tay illustrates some points made by the “Stochastic Parrots” paper, particularly the danger of not debiasing data.\n• BERT and his Muppet friends: Many deep learning models for NLP are named after Muppet characters, including ELMo, BERT, Big BIRD, ERNIE, Kermit, Grover, RoBERTa, and Rosita. Most of these models are good at providing contextual embeddings and enhanced knowledge representation.\n• Generative Pre-Trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is a 175 billion parameter model that can write original prose with human-equivalent fluency in response to an input prompt. The model is based on the transformer architecture. The previous version, GPT-2, is open source. Microsoft acquired an exclusive license to access GPT-3’s underlying model from its developer OpenAI, but other users can interact with it via an application programming interface (API). Several groups including EleutherAI and Meta have released open source interpretations of GPT-3.\n• Language Model for Dialogue Applications (LaMDA) is a conversational chatbot developed by Google. LaMDA is a transformer-based model trained on dialogue rather than the usual web text. The system aims to provide sensible and specific responses to conversations. Google developer Blake Lemoine came to believe that LaMDA is sentient. Lemoine had detailed conversations with AI about his rights and personhood. During one of these conversations, the AI changed Lemoine’s mind about Isaac Asimov’s third law of robotics. Lemoine claimed that LaMDA was sentient, but the idea was disputed by many observers and commentators. Subsequently, Google placed Lemoine on administrative leave for distributing proprietary information and ultimately fired him.\n• Mixture of Experts (MoE): While most deep learning models use the same set of parameters to process every input, MoE models aim to provide different parameters for different inputs based on efficient routing algorithms to achieve higher performance. Switch Transformer is an example of the MoE approach that aims to reduce communication and computational costs.\n\nMany languages and libraries support NLP. Here are a few of the most useful.\n• Python is the most-used programming language to tackle NLP tasks. Most libraries and frameworks for deep learning are written for Python. Here are a few that practitioners may find helpful:\n• Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is one of the first NLP libraries written in Python. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet. It also provides a suite of text-processing libraries for classification, tagging, stemming, parsing, and semantic reasoning.\n• spaCy is one of the most versatile open source NLP libraries. It supports more than 66 languages. spaCy also provides pre-trained word vectors and implements many popular models like BERT. spaCy can be used for building production-ready systems for named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, sentence segmentation, text classification, lemmatization, morphological analysis, entity linking, and so on.\n• Deep Learning libraries: Popular deep learning libraries include TensorFlow and PyTorch, which make it easier to create models with features like automatic differentiation. These libraries are the most common tools for developing NLP models.\n• Hugging Face offers open-source implementations and weights of over 135 state-of-the-art models. The repository enables easy customization and training of the models.\n• R: Many early NLP models were written in R, and R is still widely used by data scientists and statisticians. Libraries in R for NLP include TidyText, Weka, Word2Vec, SpaCyR, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.\n• Many other languages including JavaScript, Java, and Julia have libraries that implement NLP methods.\n\n\n\nNLP has been at the center of a number of controversies. Some are centered directly on the models and their outputs, others on second-order concerns, such as who has access to these systems, and how training them impacts the natural world.\n• Stochastic parrots: A 2021 paper titled “On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?” by Emily Bender, Timnit Gebru, Angelina McMillan-Major, and Margaret Mitchell examines how language models may repeat and amplify biases found in their training data. The authors point out that huge, uncurated datasets scraped from the web are bound to include social biases and other undesirable information, and models that are trained on them will absorb these flaws. They advocate greater care in curating and documenting datasets, evaluating a model’s potential impact prior to development, and encouraging research in directions other than designing ever-larger architectures to ingest ever-larger datasets.\n• Coherence versus sentience: Recently, a Google engineer tasked with evaluating the LaMDA language model was so impressed by the quality of its chat output that he believed it to be sentient. The fallacy of attributing human-like intelligence to AI dates back to some of the earliest NLP experiments.\n• Environmental impact: Large language models require a lot of energy during both training and inference. One study estimated that training a single large language model can emit five times as much carbon dioxide as a single automobile over its operational lifespan. Another study found that models consume even more energy during inference than training. As for solutions, researchers have proposed using cloud servers located in countries with lots of renewable energy as one way to offset this impact.\n• High cost leaves out non-corporate researchers: The computational requirements needed to train or deploy large language models are too expensive for many small companies. Some experts worry that this could block many capable engineers from contributing to innovation in AI.\n• Black box: When a deep learning model renders an output, it’s difficult or impossible to know why it generated that particular result. While traditional models like logistic regression enable engineers to examine the impact on the output of individual features, neural network methods in natural language processing are essentially black boxes. Such systems are said to be “not explainable,” since we can’t explain how they arrived at their output. An effective approach to achieve explainability is especially important in areas like banking, where regulators want to confirm that a natural language processing system doesn’t discriminate against some groups of people, and law enforcement, where models trained on historical data may perpetuate historical biases against certain groups.\n\n“Nonsense on stilts”: Writer Gary Marcus has criticized deep learning-based NLP for generating sophisticated language that misleads users to believe that natural language algorithms understand what they are saying and mistakenly assume they are capable of more sophisticated reasoning than is currently possible.\n\nHow To Get Started In Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n\nIf you are just starting out, many excellent courses can help.\n\nIf you want to learn more about NLP, try reading research papers. Work through the papers that introduced the models and techniques described in this article. Most are easy to find on arxiv.org. You might also take a look at these resources:\n• The Batch: A weekly newsletter that tells you what matters in AI. It’s the best way to keep up with developments in deep learning.\n• NLP News: A newsletter from Sebastian Ruder, a research scientist at Google, focused on what’s new in NLP.\n• Papers with Code: A web repository of machine learning research, tasks, benchmarks, and datasets.\n\nWe highly recommend learning to implement basic algorithms (linear and logistic regression, Naive Bayes, decision trees, and vanilla neural networks) in Python. The next step is to take an open-source implementation and adapt it to a new dataset or task.\n\nNLP is one of the fast-growing research domains in AI, with applications that involve tasks including translation, summarization, text generation, and sentiment analysis. Businesses use NLP to power a growing number of applications, both internal — like detecting insurance fraud, determining customer sentiment, and optimizing aircraft maintenance — and customer-facing, like Google Translate.\n\nAspiring NLP practitioners can begin by familiarizing themselves with foundational AI skills: performing basic mathematics, coding in Python, and using algorithms like decision trees, Naive Bayes, and logistic regression. Online courses can help you build your foundation. They can also help as you proceed into specialized topics. Specializing in NLP requires a working knowledge of things like neural networks, frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, and various data preprocessing techniques. The transformer architecture, which has revolutionized the field since it was introduced in 2017, is an especially important architecture.\n\nNLP is an exciting and rewarding discipline, and has potential to profoundly impact the world in many positive ways. Unfortunately, NLP is also the focus of several controversies, and understanding them is also part of being a responsible practitioner. For instance, researchers have found that models will parrot biased language found in their training data, whether they’re counterfactual, racist, or hateful. Moreover, sophisticated language models can be used to generate disinformation. A broader concern is that training large models produces substantial greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThis page is only a brief overview of what NLP is all about.

        "document": "Natural language processing (NLP) is a field that focuses on making natural human language usable by computer programs. NLTK, or Natural Language Toolkit, is a Python package that you can use for NLP.\n\nA lot of the data that you could be analyzing is unstructured data and contains human-readable text. Before you can analyze that data programmatically, you first need to preprocess it. In this tutorial, you’ll take your first look at the kinds of text preprocessing tasks you can do with NLTK so that you’ll be ready to apply them in future projects. You’ll also see how to do some basic text analysis and create visualizations.\n\nIf you’re familiar with the basics of using Python and would like to get your feet wet with some NLP, then you’ve come to the right place.\n\nBy the end of this tutorial, you’ll know how to:\n\nBy tokenizing, you can conveniently split up text by word or by sentence. This will allow you to work with smaller pieces of text that are still relatively coherent and meaningful even outside of the context of the rest of the text. It’s your first step in turning unstructured data into structured data, which is easier to analyze. When you’re analyzing text, you’ll be tokenizing by word and tokenizing by sentence. Here’s what both types of tokenization bring to the table:\n• Tokenizing by word: Words are like the atoms of natural language. They’re the smallest unit of meaning that still makes sense on its own. Tokenizing your text by word allows you to identify words that come up particularly often. For example, if you were analyzing a group of job ads, then you might find that the word “Python” comes up often. That could suggest high demand for Python knowledge, but you’d need to look deeper to know more.\n• Tokenizing by sentence: When you tokenize by sentence, you can analyze how those words relate to one another and see more context. Are there a lot of negative words around the word “Python” because the hiring manager doesn’t like Python? Are there more terms from the domain of herpetology than the domain of software development, suggesting that you may be dealing with an entirely different kind of python than you were expecting? Here’s how to import the relevant parts of NLTK so you can tokenize by word and by sentence: Now that you’ve imported what you need, you can create a string to tokenize. Here’s a quote from Dune that you can use: Muad'Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn. It's shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult.\"\"\" You can use to split up into sentences: [\"Muad'Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn.\", 'And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn.', \"It's shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult.\"] Tokenizing by sentence gives you a list of three strings that are sentences:\n• None \"Muad'Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn.\"\n• None 'And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn.'\n• None \"It's shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult.\" Now try tokenizing by word: You got a list of strings that NLTK considers to be words, such as: But the following strings were also considered to be words: See how was split at the apostrophe to give you and , but was left whole? This happened because NLTK knows that and (a contraction of “is”) are two distinct words, so it counted them separately. But isn’t an accepted contraction like , so it wasn’t read as two separate words and was left intact.\n\nStop words are words that you want to ignore, so you filter them out of your text when you’re processing it. Very common words like , , and are often used as stop words since they don’t add a lot of meaning to a text in and of themselves. Here’s how to import the relevant parts of NLTK in order to filter out stop words: Here’s a quote from Worf that you can filter: Now tokenize by word and store the resulting list in : You have a list of the words in , so the next step is to create a set of stop words to filter . For this example, you’ll need to focus on stop words in : Next, create an empty list to hold the words that make it past the filter: You created an empty list, , to hold all the words in that aren’t stop words. Now you can use to filter : You iterated over with a loop and added all the words that weren’t stop words to . You used on so you could ignore whether the letters in were uppercase or lowercase. This is worth doing because includes only lowercase versions of stop words. Alternatively, you could use a list comprehension to make a list of all the words in your text that aren’t stop words: When you use a list comprehension, you don’t create an empty list and then add items to the end of it. Instead, you define the list and its contents at the same time. Using a list comprehension is often seen as more Pythonic. Take a look at the words that ended up in : You filtered out a few words like and , but you also filtered out , which does affect the overall meaning of the sentence. (Worf won’t be happy about this.) Words like and may seem too important to filter out, and depending on what kind of analysis you want to do, they can be. Here’s why:\n• is a pronoun, which are context words rather than content words:\n• Content words give you information about the topics covered in the text or the sentiment that the author has about those topics.\n• Context words give you information about writing style. You can observe patterns in how authors use context words in order to quantify their writing style. Once you’ve quantified their writing style, you can analyze a text written by an unknown author to see how closely it follows a particular writing style so you can try to identify who the author is.\n• is technically an adverb but has still been included in NLTK’s list of stop words for English. If you want to edit the list of stop words to exclude or make other changes, then you can download it. So, and can be important parts of a sentence, but it depends on what you’re trying to learn from that sentence.\n\nStemming is a text processing task in which you reduce words to their root, which is the core part of a word. For example, the words “helping” and “helper” share the root “help.” Stemming allows you to zero in on the basic meaning of a word rather than all the details of how it’s being used. NLTK has more than one stemmer, but you’ll be using the Porter stemmer. Here’s how to import the relevant parts of NLTK in order to start stemming: Now that you’re done importing, you can create a stemmer with : The next step is for you to create a string to stem. Here’s one you can use: The crew of the USS Discovery discovered many discoveries. Discovering is what explorers do.\"\"\" Before you can stem the words in that string, you need to separate all the words in it: Now that you have a list of all the tokenized words from the string, take a look at what’s in : Create a list of the stemmed versions of the words in by using in a list comprehension: Take a look at what’s in : Here’s what happened to all the words that started with or : Those results look a little inconsistent. Why would give you when gives you ? Understemming and overstemming are two ways stemming can go wrong:\n• Understemming happens when two related words should be reduced to the same stem but aren’t. This is a false negative.\n• Overstemming happens when two unrelated words are reduced to the same stem even though they shouldn’t be. This is a false positive. The Porter stemming algorithm dates from 1979, so it’s a little on the older side. The Snowball stemmer, which is also called Porter2, is an improvement on the original and is also available through NLTK, so you can use that one in your own projects. It’s also worth noting that the purpose of the Porter stemmer is not to produce complete words but to find variant forms of a word. Fortunately, you have some other ways to reduce words to their core meaning, such as lemmatizing, which you’ll see later in this tutorial. But first, we need to cover parts of speech.\n\nPart of speech is a grammatical term that deals with the roles words play when you use them together in sentences. Tagging parts of speech, or POS tagging, is the task of labeling the words in your text according to their part of speech. In English, there are eight parts of speech: you, she, we Gives information about what a noun is like Is an action or a state of being Gives information about a verb, an adjective, or another adverb Gives information about how a noun or pronoun is connected to another word from, about, at Connects two other words or phrases so, because, and Some sources also include the category articles (like “a” or “the”) in the list of parts of speech, but other sources consider them to be adjectives. NLTK uses the word determiner to refer to articles. Here’s how to import the relevant parts of NLTK in order to tag parts of speech: Now create some text to tag. You can use this Carl Sagan quote: If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.\"\"\" Use to separate the words in that string and store them in a list: Now call on your new list of words: All the words in the quote are now in a separate tuple, with a tag that represents their part of speech. But what do the tags mean? Here’s how to get a list of tags and their meanings: The list is quite long, but feel free to expand the box below to see it. Here’s the list of POS tags and their meanings: $ -$ --$ A$ C$ HK$ M$ NZ$ S$ U.S.$ US$ & 'n and both but either et for less minus neither nor or plus so therefore times v. versus vs. whether yet seven 1987 twenty '79 zero two 78-degrees eighty-four IX '60s .025 all an another any both del each either every half la many much nary neither no some such that the them these this those astride among uppon whether out inside pro despite on by throughout below within for towards near behind atop around if like until below A A.

D E F First G H I J K One SP-44001 SP-44002 SP-44005 SP-44007 Second Third Three Two * a b c d first five four one six three can cannot could couldn't dare may might must need ought shall should all both half many quite such sure this hers herself him himself hisself it itself me myself one oneself ours ourselves ownself self she thee theirs them themselves they thou thy us her his mine my our ours their thy your healthier heavier higher however larger later leaner lengthier less- heartiest highest largest least less most nearest second tightest worst aboard about across along apart around aside at away back before behind by crop down ever fast for forth from go high i.e. in into just later low more off on open out over per pie raising start teeth that through under unto up up-pp upon whole with you TO: \"to\" as preposition or infinitive marker that what whatever which whichever that what whatever whatsoever which who whom whosoever how however whence whenever where whereby whereever wherein whereof why That’s a lot to take in, but fortunately there are some patterns to help you remember what’s what. Here’s a summary that you can use to get started with NLTK’s POS tags: Now that you know what the POS tags mean, you can see that your tagging was fairly successful:\n• was tagged because it’s the base form of a verb. But how would NLTK handle tagging the parts of speech in a text that is basically gibberish? Jabberwocky is a nonsense poem that doesn’t technically mean much but is still written in a way that can convey some kind of meaning to English speakers. Make a string to hold an excerpt from this poem: 'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe: all mimsy were the borogoves, and the mome raths outgrabe.\"\"\" Use to separate the words in the excerpt and store them in a list: Call on your new list of words: Accepted English words like and were correctly tagged as a conjunction and a determiner, respectively. The gibberish word was tagged as an adjective, which is what a human English speaker would probably assume from the context of the poem as well. Way to go, NLTK!\n\nNow that you’re up to speed on parts of speech, you can circle back to lemmatizing. Like stemming, lemmatizing reduces words to their core meaning, but it will give you a complete English word that makes sense on its own instead of just a fragment of a word like . Note: A lemma is a word that represents a whole group of words, and that group of words is called a lexeme. For example, if you were to look up the word “blending” in a dictionary, then you’d need to look at the entry for “blend,” but you would find “blending” listed in that entry. In this example, “blend” is the lemma, and “blending” is part of the lexeme. So when you lemmatize a word, you are reducing it to its lemma. Here’s how to import the relevant parts of NLTK in order to start lemmatizing: gave you , so that’s already a bit more sophisticated than what you would have gotten with the Porter stemmer, which is . Next, create a string with more than one word to lemmatize: Now tokenize that string by word: Create a list containing all the words in after they’ve been lemmatized: That looks right. The plurals and became the singulars and . But what would happen if you lemmatized a word that looked very different from its lemma? Try lemmatizing : You got the result because assumed that was a noun. You can make it clear that you want to be an adjective: The default parameter for is for noun, but you made sure that was treated as an adjective by adding the parameter . As a result, you got , which looks very different from your original word and is nothing like what you’d get if you were stemming. This is because is the superlative form of the adjective , and lemmatizing reduces superlatives as well as comparatives to their lemmas. Now that you know how to use NLTK to tag parts of speech, you can try tagging your words before lemmatizing them to avoid mixing up homographs, or words that are spelled the same but have different meanings and can be different parts of speech.\n\nWhile tokenizing allows you to identify words and sentences, chunking allows you to identify phrases. Note: A phrase is a word or group of words that works as a single unit to perform a grammatical function. Noun phrases are built around a noun. Chunking makes use of POS tags to group words and apply chunk tags to those groups. Chunks don’t overlap, so one instance of a word can be in only one chunk at a time. Here’s how to import the relevant parts of NLTK in order to chunk: Before you can chunk, you need to make sure that the parts of speech in your text are tagged, so create a string for POS tagging. You can use this quote from The Lord of the Rings: \"It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door.\" Now tokenize that string by word: Now you’ve got a list of all of the words in . The next step is to tag those words by part of speech: You’ve got a list of tuples of all the words in the quote, along with their POS tag. In order to chunk, you first need to define a chunk grammar. Note: A chunk grammar is a combination of rules on how sentences should be chunked. It often uses regular expressions, or regexes. For this tutorial, you don’t need to know how regular expressions work, but they will definitely come in handy for you in the future if you want to process text. stands for noun phrase. You can learn more about noun phrase chunking in Chapter 7 of Natural Language Processing with Python—Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit. According to the rule you created, your chunks:\n• Can have any number ( ) of adjectives ( ) Now try it out with your quote: Here’s how you can see a visual representation of this tree: This is what the visual representation looks like: You got two noun phrases:\n• has a determiner, an adjective, and a noun. Now that you know about chunking, it’s time to look at chinking.\n\nChinking is used together with chunking, but while chunking is used to include a pattern, chinking is used to exclude a pattern. Let’s reuse the quote you used in the section on chunking. You already have a list of tuples containing each of the words in the quote along with its part of speech tag: The next step is to create a grammar to determine what you want to include and exclude in your chunks. This time, you’re going to use more than one line because you’re going to have more than one rule. Because you’re using more than one line for the grammar, you’ll be using triple quotes ( ): The first rule of your grammar is . This rule has curly braces that face inward ( ) because it’s used to determine what patterns you want to include in you chunks. In this case, you want to include everything: . The second rule of your grammar is . This rule has curly braces that face outward ( ) because it’s used to determine what patterns you want to exclude in your chunks. In this case, you want to exclude adjectives: . Now chunk your sentence with the chink you specified: You get this tree as a result: Tree('S', [Tree('Chunk', [('It', 'PRP'), (\"'s\", 'VBZ'), ('a', 'DT')]), ('dangerous', 'JJ'), Tree('Chunk', [('business', 'NN'), (',', ','), ('Frodo', 'NNP'), (',', ','), ('going', 'VBG'), ('out', 'RP'), ('your', 'PRP$'), ('door', 'NN'), ('.', '.')])]) In this case, was excluded from the chunks because it’s an adjective ( ). But that will be easier to see if you get a graphic representation again: You get this visual representation of the : Here, you’ve excluded the adjective from your chunks and are left with two chunks containing everything else. The first chunk has all the text that appeared before the adjective that was excluded. The second chunk contains everything after the adjective that was excluded. Now that you know how to exclude patterns from your chunks, it’s time to look into named entity recognition (NER).\n\nNamed entities are noun phrases that refer to specific locations, people, organizations, and so on. With named entity recognition, you can find the named entities in your texts and also determine what kind of named entity they are. Here’s the list of named entity types from the NLTK book: You can use to recognize named entities. Let’s use again to test it out: Now take a look at the visual representation: See how has been tagged as a ? You also have the option to use the parameter if you just want to know what the named entities are but not what kind of named entity they are: Now all you see is that is an : That’s how you can identify named entities! But you can take this one step further and extract named entities directly from your text. Create a string from which to extract named entities. You can use this quote from The War of the Worlds: Men like Schiaparelli watched the red planet—it is odd, by-the-bye, that for countless centuries Mars has been the star of war—but failed to interpret the fluctuating appearances of the markings they mapped so well. All that time the Martians must have been getting ready. During the opposition of 1894 a great light was seen on the illuminated part of the disk, first at the Lick Observatory, then by Perrotin of Nice, and then by other observers. English readers heard of it first in the With this function, you gather all named entities, with no repeats. In order to do that, you tokenize by word, apply part of speech tags to those words, and then extract named entities based on those tags. Because you included , the named entities you’ll get won’t be labeled more specifically. You’ll just know that they’re named entities. Take a look at the information you extracted: You missed the city of Nice, possibly because NLTK interpreted it as a regular English adjective, but you still got the following:\n\nYou can use a dispersion plot to see how much a particular word appears and where it appears. So far, we’ve looked for and , but it would be interesting to see how much those words are used compared to their synonyms: Here’s the dispersion plot you get: Each vertical blue line represents one instance of a word. Each horizontal row of blue lines represents the corpus as a whole. This plot shows that:\n• was used a lot more than or . There were no instances of .\n• and were used a similar number of times and were more common than or . You use a dispersion plot when you want to see where words show up in a text or corpus. If you’re analyzing a single text, this can help you see which words show up near each other. If you’re analyzing a corpus of texts that is organized chronologically, it can help you see which words were being used more or less over a period of time. Staying on the theme of romance, see what you can find out by making a dispersion plot for Sense and Sensibility, which is . Jane Austen novels talk a lot about people’s homes, so make a dispersion plot with the names of a few homes: Apparently Allenham is mentioned a lot in the first third of the novel and then doesn’t come up much again. Cleveland, on the other hand, barely comes up in the first two thirds but shows up a fair bit in the last third. This distribution reflects changes in the relationship between Marianne and Willoughby:\n• Allenham is the home of Willoughby’s benefactress and comes up a lot when Marianne is first interested in him.\n• Cleveland is a home that Marianne stays at after she goes to see Willoughby in London and things go wrong. Dispersion plots are just one type of visualization you can make for textual data. The next one you’ll take a look at is frequency distributions.\n\nA collocation is a sequence of words that shows up often. If you’re interested in common collocations in English, then you can check out The BBI Dictionary of English Word Combinations. It’s a handy reference you can use to help you make sure your writing is idiomatic. Here are some examples of collocations that use the word “tree”: To see pairs of words that come up often in your corpus, you need to call on it: would like; medium build; social drinker; quiet nights; non smoker; long term; age open; Would like; easy going; financially secure; fun did show up, as did and several other word combinations. No long walks on the beach though! But what would happen if you looked for collocations after lemmatizing the words in your corpus? Would you find some word combinations that you missed the first time around because they came up in slightly varied versions? If you followed the instructions earlier, then you’ll already have a , but you can’t call on just any data type, so you’re going to need to do some prep work. Start by creating a list of the lemmatized versions of all the words in : But in order for you to be able to do the linguistic processing tasks you’ve seen so far, you need to make an NLTK text with this list: Here’s how to see the collocations in your : medium build; social drinker; non smoker; long term; would like; age open; easy going; financially secure; Would like; quiet night; Age Compared to your previous list of collocations, this new one is missing a few: The idea of still shows up in the lemmatized version, . Your latest search for collocations also brought up a few news ones:\n• suggests that users often request one or more photos. That’s how you can find common word combinations to see what people are talking about and how they’re talking about it!"

AI for customer service offers a range of capabilities that help businesses interact with their customers. Keep reading to learn how to meet growing consumer expectations by integrating AI into customer service.\n• Steps to using AI in customer service\n\nTeams use AI in customer service to perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. These AI systems are designed to understand, learn from, and respond to inquiries in a way that mimics human interaction. The core technologies driving AI customer service include natural language processing (NLP), machine learning algorithms, and data analytics.\n\nChatbots and virtual assistants are among the most visible applications of AI for customer service. These tools can manage a range of customer queries, from simple FAQs to more complex issues that may require routing to human agents. Using NLP, these systems can understand the intent behind customer messages and provide relevant responses or solutions.\n\nAI tools work with customer service functions to improve efficiency and customer satisfaction. For instance, AI can:\n• Automate responses to common inquiries, freeing up human agents to handle more complex issues\n• Help human agents by providing suggestions during customer interactions, helping them improve their decision-making processes when dealing with complex customer issues or unfamiliar scenarios\n\nMany businesses have successfully combined AI and customer service operations, improving efficiency and customer satisfaction. For instance, major e-commerce companies use AI-powered chatbots to handle initial customer inquiries, automating responses to common questions about order status, returns, and product information. This implementation can result in faster response times and reduced workload for human agents.\n\nAnother example is telecommunications providers that use AI to analyze customer call logs and identify potential issues before they escalate. Proactively addressing these concerns, the company may see a reduction in customer churn and an increase in overall satisfaction scores.\n\nYour business can use AI with Jira Service Management (JSM) to improve customer service. Here are a few AI productivity boosts you can use with JSM:\n• Automated ticket routing: AI algorithms can analyze incoming support tickets and automatically assign them to the appropriate team or service agent based on the content and urgency of the request.\n• Intelligent knowledge base suggestions: When agents work on tickets within JSM, AI can suggest relevant articles from the knowledge base, helping them resolve issues more quickly and consistently.\n• AI answers: This feature uses generative AI, powered by your knowledge base and Atlassian Intelligence, to respond to customer requests. With the information in your existing knowledge base, AI can provide accurate and contextually relevant responses to customer inquiries, improving response times and consistency in service delivery.\n\nIntegrating AI into customer service operations yields significant advantages for businesses and their customers. AI customer service solutions can transform support processes and improve the customer experience. Here are some benefits of using AI for customer service:\n• Faster response times: Are you looking for ways to streamline customer service management?

Use this data to adjust and improve your AI systems and processes to meet your business needs and customer expectations.\n\nWhen implementing AI in customer service, it’s crucial to maintain a balance between automation and human interaction. While AI excels at handling routine inquiries and initial customer interactions, complex issues often require the nuanced understanding and problem-solving skills that human agents provide.\n\nMany customers also appreciate human interaction’s empathy and emotional connection, especially when dealing with sensitive matters.\n\nTo strike the right balance between a human and AI approach, consider using AI as a first line of response for customer inquiries. However, program your system to recognize complex issues or detect when a customer is becoming frustrated. Create seamless pathways for these interactions to transfer to human agents, and offer customers the choice to speak with a human representative from the outset. By blending AI efficiency with human empathy, you can create a customer service experience that’s both fast and personalized.\n\nRemember, implementing AI in customer service isn’t a one-and-done process; it requires ongoing attention and refinement. Regularly update your AI with the latest information about your products, services, and policies to maintain accurate and relevant responses to customer inquiries.\n\nMonitor AI performance by tracking key metrics like response accuracy, customer satisfaction scores, and resolution times. This data provides valuable insights into how well your AI serves your customers and where improvements might be needed.\n\nSet a regular schedule for updating your AI’s knowledge base and reviewing its performance metrics. Engage your customer service team and customers by providing feedback on their interactions with the AI.\n\nBy keeping your AI system updated and closely monitoring its effectiveness, you can address emerging challenges and adapt to changing customer needs.\n\nIntegrating AI with Jira Service Management (JSM) can significantly streamline customer service operations and improve efficiency.
