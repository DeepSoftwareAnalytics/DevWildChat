        "document": "\n• None Wine allows you to run many Windows programs on Linux. Its homepage can be found at WineHQ.org. They also have an Ubuntu page with installation and build advice.\n• None If you are running the latest release of Wine which is v1.6, you can get further assistance on the #winehq IRC channel on irc.freenode.net. First,\n• None please consider if you really need to run the specific Windows program because in most cases, its equivalent can be provided by an OpenSource program. Also, consider using Qemu instead of Wine if you need a complete Windows installation.\n\nThe Wine Ubuntu repository provides the newest development versions of Wine. Follow these steps to add the repository to your software sources:\n\nNote, however, that these are development packages (ie beta software), and may suffer from regressions and other problems not present in the stable version of Wine included with Ubuntu. You should avoid using them unless the current stable version of Wine does not support or is incompatible with the application you wish to use.\n\nIf you are using an older version of Wine and want support from WineHQ, you will need to upgrade to the latest development version first. If you do this, however, please file associated Wine bugs at winehq's Bugzilla Page rather than in Launchpad.\n\nBefore using Wine, it is necessary to create the fake C: drive where your Windows applications will be installed. To do this, enter the following command into the terminal: You may find the terminal by going to Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal\n\nYou also have the option of configuring Wine via the Configure Wine option in the Applications-> Wine menu.\n\nThis will create a hidden folder (.wine) in your home directory containing the fake C: drive as well as registry files similar to those used in Windows. Once this directory is created, the Wine Configuration Window will appear. This window will allow you to customize a variety of settings for Wine, including which Windows Version that is emulated, drive mappings, DLL overrides, as well as application specific settings. Click the Ok button to close the window.\n\nTo install Windows applications using Wine, follow these instructions:\n• Download the Windows application from any source (e.g. download.com). Download the .EXE (executable).\n• Place it in a convenient directory (e.g. the desktop, or home folder).\n• None Open the terminal, and cd into the directory where the .EXE is located.\n\nThis will start the .EXE using Wine. If it is an installer, it should then run as it would in Windows. If the application asks for a directory to install the application to, select put it under C:\\Program Files.\n\nAfter installing an application using the directions above, those applications can be started and used by entering wine programname.exe (e.g. wine realplayer.exe). When done, close the application as one would normally. You must run the installed executable, which will by default be in the virtual Windows drive created by Wine, at ~/.wine/drive_c. Generally programs will install themselves somewhere under Program Files inside the virtual Windows drive, following Windows conventions.\n\nYou can also use the Wine file browser, by running winefile in a terminal. Clicking the C:\\ button in the toolbar will open a window where you can browse the virtual Windows drive created in .wine. Doubleclicking an executable in the Wine file browser will run it in Wine.\n\nInstead of having to always enter the terminal or use the Wine file browser, you may also create a desktop icon, and start a Wine application using that icon. To do this, right click on the desktop and select \"Create a launcher.\" If you wish, select an icon from the list of available icons (or browse to an icon you would like to use), fill out other information that is requested (Name, generic name, etc.). For the command, type in wine the-location-of-the-program.exe (e.g. wine /home/john/.wine/realplayer.exe). The most important part of creating a launcher is the command, the generic name is not as important. Just make sure you de-select \"Run in terminal.\" This completes the process.\n\nIn some cases the application requires to be running from a certain location. In this case create launcher with command\n\nOf course you will need to replace USER and Appdir with the proper data.\n\nIf you desire to have an icon on the panel, create a launcher on the panel of choice. Do this by right-clicking the panel, selecting \"Add to Panel,\" and selecting \"Custom Application Launcher.\" This will ask you for the same information as before.\n\nAlternatively, to make life easier, you can set it so wine will automatically open .exe files files for you - instead of using the Wine File to locate the file each time. To do so, right click on the .exe file, select Properties, and then select the Open With tab. Click the 'Add' button, and then click on 'Use a custom command'. In the line that appears, type in wine, then click Add, and Close. Now all .exe files will be automatically opened by Wine, so you can use Nautilus to browse and open them instead of the Wine File.\n\nOpen up a terminal window and type the command below.\n\nWhat this will do is open up a program similar to the Windows add/remove programs control panel, allowing you to uninstall applications from a Wine installation. Running uninstall programs directly via Wine should also work normally. Alternatively, you could also simply delete the folder of the application. However, as when done in Windows, this method will be unclean and will not remove the program's configuration from the Wine registry like using an uninstaller will.\n\nOn the command line or in Run Application, type\n\nGo to the drives tab in winecfg. Hit the Autodetect button.\n\nIf you find that this does not work correctly for you, then follow these instructions:\n• None Click Show Advanced button below the Browse... button and set the Type to\n\nIf you have more than one CD/DVD device you will need to identify each one differently. Use /media/cdrom0 for the first CD/DVD device, /media/cdrom1 for the second one, and so on. If in doubt, type the following command in your terminal.\n\nWhat this command will do is check your CD/DVD device details after Wine is installed.\n\nIt is good procedure before setting up the menu entry to launch the new Windows program from the command line to make sure the program runs properly. To do this type this command in the terminal.\n\nFor example the command would be wine \"C:\\Program Files\\World of Warcraft\\WoW.exe\" Once you are satisfied that you have the correct details, use the normal menu editing process to add a new entry. When you get to the Command field of the entry editor be sure to copy and paste the line you used to launch the program from the terminal. Finish and save the new entry. Test to make sure the new Windows program loads via the menu.\n• None Type this command into your terminal.\n• Navigate to where the .exe is and choose that program\n• The dropdown at the bottom allows you to choose which version of Windows Wine should emulate. Also, any changes to the Libraries and Graphics tabs will only affect the chosen application in the Applications tab.\n\nYou can change the wine color scheme to closely match the default Ubuntu colors with this Terminal command.\n\nYou may also want to create a backup copy in your Home folder with this command via terminal.\n\nWine has basic handling for Windows theme/skin files in the \"msstyles\" format. There is a large number of these themes on Deviant Art. To use these you must make a folder in Wine's virtual Windows drive, then tell Wine to use the theme.\n\nFirstly go into Wine's virtual drive, which is usually \".wine/drive_c\" in your Home folder (this is hidden, you may need to select View->Show Hidden Files in the file manager). Inside this folder go into the \"windows\" folder then make a new folder in there called \"Resources\". Enter this new folder and make a new folder called \"Themes\". Inside here you should make a folder for each theme you want, and put the files ending in \".msstyles\" directly into them. For example, the full path to a theme file called sample.msstyles might be \"/home/username/.wine/drive_c/windows/Resources/Themes/Sample/sample.msstyles\".\n\nNext you need to tell Wine to use your theme, so once again run this command in the terminal.\n\nIn the configuration window select the tab Desktop Integration and un-check out the Theme: box, which should now have your theme in it's menu. After selecting the theme click Apply at the bottom to see how it looks (they don't always display properly), then if you are happy click ok and you're done!\n\nSometimes the Panel overlaps your fullscreen application you're running in wine. If you are running Visual Effects, the first solution you should try is to turn those off: Go to System -> Preferences -> Appearance, and click the Visual Effects tab. Select None, and your screen will flash. Try your full-screen application again. You may re-enable Visual Effects afterwards - just don't forget to turn them back off when you want to run that application again!\n\nIf that does not work, then you will have to turn off the panels prior to running the application and restarting it afterwards, until a better workaround can be found. In Ubuntu the commands are gnome-session-remove gnome-panel and gnome-panel & respectively. In Xubuntu I understand they are and .\n\nInstructions for using wine over remote X11 sessions\n\nIf you're (trying) to use wine over a forwarded X11 session (ie Ubuntu is on one computer; you're connected to it by ssh or another connection and you already have X11 forwarding set up to display regular Ubuntu applications on your remote computer) and the windows opened by wine are lacking fonts etc, the answer is here\n\nSome Windows programs have been tested on Ubuntu. They are listed below:\n\nAlso, see Wine's Application Database at http://appdb.winehq.org/ or http://wine-review.blogspot.com/\n\nIf you want certain files to open in a windows application by clicking on them, the best way is to create a script. For example I want Adobe Flash project files (*.fla) to open in Adobe's Flash editor if I double click it.\n\nYou can for example create a file using this terminal command.\n\nNow paste the following example script in it, save and close gedit.\n\nMake sure the file is executable with this command.\n\nAfter you completed this go to an *.fla file right click it, properties, go to the “open with” pane, click add, add this line into your terminal and select the radio button.\n\nNow if everything went ok, you can doubleclick the file and it will be openend in Flash 8.\n\nError: Cannot change screen BPP from 32 to XX\n\nIn some cases (mostly games) the application does not start and you get error: Cannot change screen BPP from 32 to 16 (or some other number).\n\nIn such case editing xorg.conf and CTRL-ALT-Backspace helps as is described on http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=649283\n\nIt seems that in Ubuntu Karmic Wine(v1.0.1) registry isn't configured correctly to use ActiveX component dhtmled.ocx. On some application this can cause error like this: \"Component 'dhtmled.ocx' or one of it's dependencies not correctly registered: a file is missing or invalid\". So we must tell Wine where to find this file.\n\nScreen flickers to black when starting an application\n\nThis is sometimes caused by a problem with the video driver not handling XRandR well. To see if this is actually a problem with XRandR, in a console, run:\n\nIf your screen blanks while running that command, then this might be the issue. To work around this issue, Wine can be configured to not use XRandR. To do so:\n• Navigate to \"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Wine\\X11 Driver\". You may need to create X11 Driver.\n• Create a new key called \"UseXRandR\" and set it to \"N\"."

        "document": "With the end of life coming for Windows 10 and the system requirements issue with Windows 11, many users are seeking alternatives. One of the most popular alternatives to Windows is Linux. But what do Windows users do about running Windows apps on the open-source operating system?\n\nAlso: Your Windows 10 PC can't be upgraded? You have 5 options before support ends in 2025\n\nWine is a compatibility layer that lets you run Windows apps on Linux. Because there are so many applications for Windows that don't have a native version for Linux, it became necessary to create the means to run them on the open-source operating system.\n\nWhen you combine the lengthy list of native applications you can install on Linux with the built-in app stores, the universal package managers Snap and Flatpak, AppImages, and Wine, the list of available software for Linux is massive.\n\nUnfortunately, not every Windows app can run via Wine. If you're curious about the apps that can, here's a searchable database that lists them, from games to productivity tools and everything in between.\n\nAlso: Ubuntu vs. Debian: 7 key differences help determine which distro is right for you\n\nThe good news is that the Wine development team is always quite busy. The latest release of the software added enhancements such as improved API compatibility; fixed bugs related to DirectX to improve game stability; improved graphics rendering and more accurate high-DPI support (with automatic scaling of non-DPI-aware windows); added ARM support, new debugging tools, a new desktop control applet, and an applet for toggling advanced joystick settings; added the X11 backend with multi-touch functionality; and much more.\n\nSo, how do you run those Windows apps on Linux with Wine? Let's get to work.\n\nHow to run a Windows app on Linux with Wine\n\nWhat you'll need: I'll demonstrate the process on Ubuntu Desktop, but Wine can be installed on most Linux distributions. To install Wine, you'll need a running Linux distribution and a user with sudo privileges. That's it.\n\nDo note that the above command will take some time to complete.\n\nYou can then install Wine with the command:\n\nYou will also need to install Winetricks manually for Fedora, which can be done with the following command:\n\nWinetricks also lets you take care of several other options, such as installing DLLs, fonts, and more.\n\nAt this point, though, you can close that window and prepare to install your first Windows app.\n\nI'll show you how to install the Notepad++ Windows app with Wine's help.\n\nFirst, download the Windows installer for the app and save it in your Downloads directory. Then, open your terminal window and change into the Downloads directory with the command cd ~/Downloads.\n\nRun the installer with the command wine npp.*.exe. Finally, the Windows install wizard will open, where you can click your way to success. If you receive an error that 32-bit support is missing, you can run the following command to fix the error:\n\nOnce the installation completes, you'll find the Notepad++ launcher in your desktop menu.\n\nAnother cool trick up Wine's sleeve is the ability to install a Windows app directly from within Winetricks. If you run the Winetricks app, which can now be launched from your desktop menu, and select \"Install an application,\" you'll be greeted with a list of applications that you can install directly from the GUI.\n\nAlso: Seeking the latest in Linux? There's a right way and a wrong way to use Distrowatch\n\nThis method will automatically download and run the necessary installer file and then open the install wizard to complete the process.\n\nFurther configuration might be needed\n\nNotepad++ is a fairly simple app to install with Wine. However, some apps (especially games) might require further configuration. If that occurs, run the Winetricks app again to correct the configurations.\n\nThe amount of work needed will depend on the app you want to install. If you receive errors when you try to install a Windows app via Wine, you might have to research which configurations are necessary for that particular app.\n\nAlso: Want to save your aging computer? Try these 5 Linux distributions\n\nEven with those potential issues, installing supported Windows apps on Linux with Wine is considerably easier than you might think. If your computer currently runs Windows 10 and won't run Windows 11, why not install one of the many Linux distributions on that machine and continue using it for years to come?"

However, the repositories often do not include the latest versions.\n\nIf you need a more recent Wine version, install it from the developers' repositories. The following text explains how to do it.\n\nIf you are using a 64-bit OS, enable the 32-bit architecture. This allows you to install and run 32-bit software, including libraries and applications. The process is necessary for Wine because many Windows applications, especially older ones, are designed for 32-bit systems.\n\nThe command has no output.\n\nAdd the GPG key to ensure the downloaded packages are from trusted sources and have not been tampered with.:\n\nRun the following command to add the WineHQ repository to Ubuntu:\n\nTo install Wine, take the following steps:\n\n2.

Stable releases come out every 10-12 weeks, while developer updates come out more frequently.\n\nTo set up the configuration directory for Wine, run the following command:\n\nThe command creates the Wine configuration directory, typically located at ~/.wine. This directory serves as the Wine C: drive equivalent, where Windows applications are installed and configured.\n\nIf you're running a GUI on Ubuntu, right-click the .exe file you want to open, in this case, OfficeSetup.exe, and select Open With Wine Windows Program Loader.\n\nTo launch the application from the command line, take the following steps:\n\n1. Change the working directory to the OfficeSetup.exe location, in this case the Downloads directory:\n\nUnlike the command, allows Wine to manage the working directory. It establishes a standard working directory (often the user's home directory) before application execution, ensuring accurate interpretation of file paths and resource access. This enables Windows programs to access files and resources as if operating in a Windows environment.\n\nThe benefits of using are convenience and automation. The command handles the working directory for each application launched, making it more straightforward, especially when dealing with multiple applications or complex directory structures.\n\nTo launch a Windows application (OfficeSetup.exe in this example), run:\n\nHow to Uninstall Wine From Ubuntu\n\nTo uninstall Wine, use this command:\n\nInstead of , use , , or depending on the version you have installed.\n\nThe command removes Wine but not its dependencies.

        "document": "VirtualBox is a powerful open-source virtualization software developed by Oracle. It allows users to run multiple operating systems simultaneously on a single machine. Installing VirtualBox on Ubuntu enables users to experiment with different operating systems, test software, and develop applications in isolated virtual environments.\n\nIn this article, you will learn how to install VirtualBox on Ubuntu using three different methods.\n\nOne way to install VirtualBox is to use the official Ubuntu repositories. The process is straightforward and performed using the package manager (apt).\n\nTo install VirtualBox, follow the steps in the sections below.\n\nBefore installation, update the package repository with:\n\nNext, download and install VirtualBox by running:\n\nThe Extension Pack provides additional features and support for USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 devices, VirtualBox Remote Desktop Protocol (VRDP) support, Disk encryption, Intel PXE boot ROM, etc.\n\nTo install the VirtualBox Extension Pack, take the following steps:\n\n2. Read the VirtualBox Extension Pack Personal Use and Evaluation License (PUEL) and select <Ok> to confirm.\n\n3. Accept the VirtualBox PUEL license terms by selecting <Yes> and hitting Enter.\n\nOnce the installation is completed, VirtualBox is ready to run. Start it by executing:\n\nThe command has no output but starts VirtualBox.\n\nOften, the default repositories do not have the latest software versions. For example, run the following command to see the latest VirtualBox version installed via the Ubuntu repository:\n\nThe installed version is 6.1.50, while the latest version on the VirtualBox website is 7.0.14.\n\nThe older version may work for test environments, but some users need the latest security or functionality patches. The solution is to install VirtualBox from Oracle Repositories. This process is more in-depth but installs the most recent VirtualBox version on Ubuntu.\n\nThe package is required to run Virtualbox on Ubuntu. It allows users to add new software repositories.\n\nEnter the following command to install the package:\n\nAdding GPG keys to the system ensures the integrity and authenticity of the packages you install, especially from third-party repositories like the VirtualBox repository.\n\nTo add the VirtualBox repository, enter the command :\n\nThe command creates a repository entry for VirtualBox in Ubuntu's package manager configuration file, specifying the appropriate URL and Ubuntu release codename. It then writes this entry to a file named virtualbox.list in the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ directory. Then, the system can fetch and install VirtualBox packages from the added repository.\n\nThe output indicates the command successfully wrote the VirtualBox repository entry to the specified file.\n\n2. Use the following syntax to install VirtualBox on Ubuntu:\n\nAt the time of writing this article, the latest VirtualBox version is 7.0.14. Therefore, to install it, run:\n\nThe command installs the version of VirtualBox currently available in the added repository.\n\nThe VirtualBox Extension Pack enhances the virtual machines' functionality. Install it by taking the following steps:\n\nThe current extension pack version on the VirtualBox website is 7.0.14. Therefore, the command is:\n\n3. Confirm the installation and allow the process to complete.\n\nAnother way to install VirtualBox on Ubuntu is to use the .deb file. The following steps explain how to do that.\n\nTo start the installation, download the .deb file from the VirtualBox website. Take the following steps:\n\n1. Go to the VirtualBox Download page.\n\n3. Find the download link for the current Linux version. In this example, it is Ubuntu 22.04.\n\n4. Click the link and wait for the download to finish.\n\nNote where the file is saved, as it is needed in the next step. In this example, the file is downloaded to the Downloads directory.\n\n1. Navigate to the directory where the package is downloaded. In this case, it is the Downloads directory. Use the cd command:\n\n2. Use the dpkg command to install the .deb file from the Downloads directory. The syntax is:\n\nIn this example, the command is:\n\nOnce the installation is completed, verify the installation by running the app:\n\nThe command has no output but launches the VirtualBox program.\n\nOnce installed, VirtualBox allows users to create and manage virtual machines. The software lets users run multiple guest operating systems concurrently on the host machine.\n• File:\n• New. Creates a new virtual machine. When selected, VirtualBox opens a wizard that guides users through creating a new virtual machine.\n• Add. Adds an existing virtual machine to the VirtualBox Manager.\n• Preferences. Configures VirtualBox settings such as general, input, and network settings.\n• Machine:\n• Start. Starts the selected virtual machine. Once a virtual machine is created or imported into VirtualBox, use this option to boot it up and start using it.\n• Pause. This option pauses the selected virtual machine. When users pause a virtual machine, its state is saved, and it temporarily stops executing. This is useful for temporarily suspending a virtual machine without shutting it down.\n• Power Off. Powers off the selected virtual machine and saves the state.\n• Devices:\n• Shared Clipboard. This option enables or disables the shared clipboard. When enabled, text and files can be copied and pasted between the host operating system and the guest operating system running in the virtual machine.\n• Drag and Drop. Enables or disables drag and drop. When enabled, users can drag files and directories between the host operating system and the guest operating system.\n\nThese menu items vary depending on the version of VirtualBox and the operating system.\n\nVirtualBox's primary function is to install and run an operating system within another operating system by creating virtual machines. Take the following steps to create a virtual machine.\n\n1. Launch the VirtualBox interface if not already launched:\n\n2. Click the New button to create a new virtual machine. A dialog box opens.\n\n3. Type the OS name. The Type and Version are filled out automatically based on the name. However, change them manually if needed.\n\n4. In the same window, the system prompts you to select an ISO file to boot from. This ISO file can be obtained from the official website of the operating system you wish to install (e.g., Debian, Windows, etc.). Choose the file and click Next.\n\n5. Choose the username, password, hostname, and domain name. You can install Guest Additions in this step. Guest Additions are drivers and utilities that enhance the performance and usability of guest operating systems.\n\n6. Allocate the base memory and the virtual CPU count. Make sure the sliders stay on the green side to ensure the allocated resources are within the recommended range. This step ensures optimal performance of both the host and guest operating systems.\n\n7. Mark the Create a Virtual Hard Disk Now checkbox, adjust the Disk Size slider, and click Next.\n\n8. Check all the settings in the Summary section and click Finish. Once finished, the machine starts installing and configuring;\n\n8. Once installation completes, a new virtual machine appears in the left column. Select it and click the green arrow Start button.\n\nA new window opens and boots up the virtual machine.\n\nAfter reading this article, you know three different methods to install VirtualBox on Ubuntu.
