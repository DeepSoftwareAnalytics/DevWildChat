        "link": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_images/Using_CSS_gradients",
        "document": "CSS gradients are represented by the data type, a special type of made of a progressive transition between two or more colors. You can choose between three types of gradients: linear (created with the function), radial (created with the function), and conic (created with the function). You can also create repeating gradients with the , , and functions. Gradients can be used anywhere you would use an , such as in backgrounds. Because gradients are dynamically generated, they can negate the need for the raster image files that traditionally were used to achieve similar effects. In addition, because gradients are generated by the browser, they look better than raster images when zoomed in, and can be resized on the fly. We'll start by introducing linear gradients, then introduce features that are supported in all gradient types using linear gradients as the example, then move on to radial, conic and repeating gradients\n\nTo include a solid, non-transitioning color area within a gradient, include two positions for the color stop. Color stops can have two positions, which is equivalent to two consecutive color stops with the same color at different positions. The color will reach full saturation at the first color stop, maintain that saturation through to the second color stop, and transition to the adjacent color stop's color through the adjacent color stop's first position. .multiposition-stops { background: linear-gradient( to left, lime 20%, red 30%, red 45%, cyan 55%, cyan 70%, yellow 80% ); background: linear-gradient( to left, lime 20%, red 30% 45%, cyan 55% 70%, yellow 80% ); } .multiposition-stop2 { background: linear-gradient( to left, lime 25%, red 25%, red 50%, cyan 50%, cyan 75%, yellow 75% ); background: linear-gradient( to left, lime 25%, red 25% 50%, cyan 50% 75%, yellow 75% ); } In the first example above, the lime goes from the 0% mark, which is implied, to the 20% mark, transitions from lime to red over the next 10% of the width of the gradient, reach solid red at the 30% mark, and staying solid red up until 45% through the gradient, where it fades to cyan, being fully cyan for 15% of the gradient, and so on. In the second example, the second color stop for each color is at the same location as the first color stop for the adjacent color, creating a striped effect. In both examples, the gradient is written twice: the first is the CSS Images Level 3 method of repeating the color for each stop and the second example is the CSS Images Level 4 multiple color stop method of including two color-stop-lengths in a linear-color-stop declaration.\n\nUnlike linear gradients, you can specify the size of radial gradients. Possible values include , , , and , with being the default. Circles can also be sized with a length, and ellipses a length or percentage. This example uses the size value, which means the size is set by the distance from the starting point (the center) to the closest side of the enclosing box. This example is similar to the previous one, except that its size is specified as , which sets the size of the gradient by the distance from the starting point to the farthest corner of the enclosing box from the starting point. This example uses , which makes the circle's radius to be the distance between the center of the gradient and the closest side. In this case the radius is the distance between the center and the bottom edge, because the gradient is placed 25% from the left and 25% from the bottom, and the div element's height is smaller than the width. Example: length or percentage for ellipses For ellipses only, you can size the ellipse using a length or percentage. The first value represents the horizontal radius, the second the vertical radius, where you use a percentage this corresponds to the size of the box in that dimension. In the below example I have used a percentage for the horizontal radius. For circles the size may be given as a , which is the size of the circle.\n\nThe CSS function creates an image consisting of a gradient with color transitions rotated around a center point (rather than radiating from the center). Example conic gradients include pie charts and color wheels, but they can also be used for creating checker boards and other interesting effects. The conic-gradient syntax is similar to the radial-gradient syntax, but the color-stops are placed around a gradient arc, the circumference of a circle, rather than on the gradient line emerging from the center of the gradient, and the color-stops are percentages or degrees: absolute lengths are not valid. In a radial gradient, the colors transition from the center of an ellipse, outward, in all directions. With conic gradients, the colors transition as if spun around the center of a circle, starting at the top and going clockwise. Similar to radial gradients, you can position the center of the gradient. Similar to linear gradients, you can change the gradient angle.\n\nThe , , and functions don't support automatically repeated color stops. However, the , , and functions are available to offer this functionality. The size of the gradient line or arc that repeats is the length between the first color stop value and the last color stop length value. If the first color stop just has a color and no color stop length, the value defaults to 0. If the last color stop has just a color and no color stop length, the value defaults to 100%. If neither is declared, the gradient line is 100% meaning the linear and conic gradients will not repeat and the radial gradient will only repeat if the radius of the gradient is smaller than the length between the center of the gradient and the farthest corner. If the first color stop is declared, and the value is greater than 0, the gradient will repeat, as the size of the line or arc is the difference between the first color stop and last color stop is less than 100% or 360 degrees."

        "document": "I'm tinkering with writing a more efficient methodology in the creation of dynamically generated DOM elements via JavaScript. This is something I intend to add into my own JS framework later on. Looking for other OOP devs that could help better refine what I do have.\n\nAnd some CSS to get elements to appear on page:\n• For performance, using the prototype to build methods versus placing all the logic in the constructor.\n• Rather than directly appending elements to the page, append to a single Document Fragment. Once the element is built out as a Doc Frag, appending the Doc Frag to to the DOM. I like this method for performance, but would like to improve upon it. Any useful implementations of requestnimationFrame, or using range and other versions of the document fragment method?\n• Silly, but I think for debugging it'd be nice to see the generated Element type within the Object property's on console log. As of right now, console logging a created element will show the elements parent and text content. It'd be great to show the elements type as well.\n• None Creating more than one element at a time is another piece of functionality I'd like to offer as an option. For instance, creating a div element creates one div element. What's a good way to add another optional method to create multiple instances of div's. div.elType('DIV'); // After calling the elType method, do something like this: div.elCount(20); // This would create 20 of the same divs\n• None Lastly, a nice clean way to optionally add attributes (i.e: classes, an ID, value, a placeholder, custom attributes, data-* attributes, etc.). I've got a nice helper function I use that adds multiple attributes to an element in an object literal syntax looking way. Adding this as a method of the constructor would be ideal. Here's that function: function setAttributes(el, attrs) { for(var key in attrs) { el.setAttribute(key, attrs[key]); } } // A use case using the above // function would be: var anInputElement = document.createElement(\"TEXTAREA\"); setAttributes(anInputElement, { \"type\": \"text\", \"id\": \"awesomeID\", \"name\": \"coolName\", \"placeholder\": \"Hey I'm some placeholder example text\", \"class\": \"awesome\" }); // Which creates the following HTML snippet: <textarea type=\"text\" id=\"awesomeID\" name=\"coolName\" placeholder=\"Hey I'm some placeholder example text\" class=\"awesome\">\n\nAs a side note, realizing now that the above helper function needs rewritten so that multiple classes could be created."

        "document": "The DOM stands for the Document Object Model (DOM), which allows us to interact with the document and change its structure, style, and content. We can use the DOM to change the content and style of an HTML element by changing its properties.\n\nIn this article, we will discuss how to manipulate the DOM elements.\n\nWe can manipulate or change the DOM elements by using the following methods:\n\n1. Change the Content of an Element\n\nYou can change the content inside an HTML element using JavaScript. The two most common properties for this are innerHTML and textContent:\n• innerHTML: Allows you to get or set the\n• textContent: Allows you to get or set the text content inside an element, ignoring any HTML tags.\n\nIn this example\n• None innerHTML changes the entire content of an element, including HTML tags. In this case, we replace the content of the first div with bold text using <strong>.\n• None textContent changes only the text inside the element, ignoring any HTML tags. The second div is updated with plain text, without any HTML formatting.\n• None The first div shows \"This is the original content using innerHTML.\"\n• None The second div shows \"This is the original text content using textContent.\"\n• None The first div will display \"This is changed using innerHTML!\" with bold text.\n• None The second div will display \"This is changed using textContent!\" with plain text.\n\nYou can add, remove, or toggle classes on an element using JavaScript. This is helpful for styling or applying animations.\n• classList.toggle(): Toggles a class (adds it if it's not present, removes it if it is).\n\nIn this example\n• Adding a Class (addClass()) : When you click the \"Add 'highlight' Class\" button, the highlight class is added to the div element with the id=\"example\". This changes the text color to red and makes it bold (as defined in the CSS).\n• Removing a Class (removeClass()): When you click the \"Remove 'bold' Class\" button, the bold class is removed from the div, which removes the bold styling from the text.\n• Toggling a Class (toggleClass()): When you click the \"Toggle 'highlight' Class\" button, the highlight class is either added or removed, depending on whether it's already present. If the class is present, it will be removed; if not, it will be added.\n\nYou can directly manipulate the CSS styles of an element using the style property. This allows you to dynamically change how elements appear on the page.\n\nSometimes, you need to create new elements, add them to the DOM, or remove existing ones. You can do this easily with the following methods\n\nYou can insert new elements at specific positions relative to existing elements using methods like insertBefore().\n\nYou can easily get, set, or remove the attributes of an HTML element using the following methods:\n• getAttribute() : Retrieves the value of an attribute.\n• setAttribute() : Sets a new value for an attribute.\n\nHTML5 introduced data attributes, which are custom attributes that you can use to store extra information about an element. These are particularly useful for adding data to an element without affecting its visual structure.\n• dataset: A special property in JavaScript that allows you to access data attributes.\n\nManipulating the DOM with JavaScript is a core aspect of web development. Understanding how to select, modify, and manipulate DOM elements enables you to create dynamic, interactive web applications. With the power to change text, styles, attributes, and even structure in real-time, JavaScript empowers developers to build rich, user-responsive websites.\n\nWhat is the difference between innerText and innerHTML?\n\nHow can I remove an element from the DOM using JavaScript?\n\nWhat is event delegation, and why is it useful?\n\nHow do you add a new element to the DOM?\n\nHow do you remove an element from the DOM?"
