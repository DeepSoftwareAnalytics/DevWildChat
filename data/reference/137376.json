        "document": "The reason for not doing this is basically programming skills. It seems to me easier to just set a few bits each time to activate or deactivate the relevant bits on the screen than trying to compose the serial data stream. When the screen is on the wait state, ie when there is no change to be displayed, then the mcu could do something else and not bothering about the screen refreshing. All you need to know in order to display something on a row, is the relevant combination of binary number to send to the screen row. This number will be demultiplexed and then correspond to that row. at the same time you send the relevant combination number to the column. \n\n \n\n Other reasons that one might think to do it this way may include is expandability. If you expand your led screen to much more rows/columns, there will be a case where the hardware speed (mcu/logic/leds) may be the limiting factor. If the row scanning rate is too high, in order to keep for the difference, this may cause the leds to get dim and not display at all at some time.\n\n \n\n Another reason may be power consumption possibly. I am not sure if the power that a micro consumes depends of the amount of work it does, but since it includes a cpu, it may be the case. The screen \"buffers\" although, will probably consume more power this way anyway.\n\n \n\n If you use the row-scanning method you always need a micro to do the job. If you use the method I propose you may be able to drive the screen with simpler electronics (just a though) since there is no serial data stream and complex timing to cope with. You can \"refresh\" the screen at any time interval you wish and do this for just specific bits.\n\n \n\n It sure adds more components to the circuit but at the benefit of simpler programming and easier interfacing.\n\n \n\n What do you think of this?"

        "document": "This moving LED Display use four 5×7 Dot-matrix bar along with Max-6952 driver IC and AT89C51 Microcontroller.Max-6952 is LED dot-matrix driver IC from MAXIM. Max-6952 can drive up-to 4 Digits (140 LEDs). Included static RAM that stores each digit, as well as font data for 24user-definable characters and built-In ASCII 104-Character.This max6952 IC is SPI Compatible. This Max-6952 IC can drive four single Colour matrix display or two bicolour matrix Display.\n\nIn this project I have interfaced four single colour LED Dot-matrix Display with AT89C51 microcontroller using Max-6952.This Driver IC is very useful because we cannot interface four Digits directly to port pins without consuming almost all of the pins which is quit impractical.\n\nThis IC have built-In ASCII 104 characters so to display any characters we have to just provide ASCII code in Hex to this IC through DIN (Data-Input) pin.\n\nThe MAX6952 interfaced with AT89C51 through an SPI-compatible serial interface. The interface has three inputs, clock (CLK), chip-select (CS), and data in (DIN) and one output, data out (DOUT).Here in this project I have used only three input pins.\n\nWe can use this Moving LED Display as a Name plate or in BUS to indicate Route or at any office, building to indicate floor as well as in LIFT system.\n\nIn this project I have used AT89C51 Microcontroller which is 40 pin µC. This µc has 4KB of ROM and 128 bytes of RAM and built in Timer/counter, UART modules etc. It has Total 32 I/O pins. It can run on any frequency between 4 to 44 MHz and I have used 12 MHz in this particular project.8051 micro-controller doesn’t have SPI module in it so I have used its i/o pin to interface with SPI compatible Max-6952 Display driver.\n\nThis Max-6952 IC can drive four single Colour matrix display or two bicolour matrix Display. It has total 40 pins. It can operate on 2.7V to5.5V.It included static RAM that stores each digit, as well as font data for 24user-definable characters and built-In ASCII 104-Character.This Max-6952 IC is SPI Compatible. It contains 16-bit shift register into which Input data are clocked on the rising edge of CLK, when CS is low. This IC have built-In ASCII 104 characters so to display any characters we have to just provide ASCII code in Hex to this IC through DIN (Data-Input) pin.\n\nO0 to O13: This pins are connected to LED display’s anode.\n\nO14 to O23: This pins source current to the display’s anode columns.\n\nDIN: Serial Data Input. Data is loaded into the internal 16-bit shift register on the rising edge of the CLK.\n\nCLK: Serial-Clock Input. On the rising edge of CLK, data is shifted into the internal shift register. CLK input is active only while CS is low.\n\nCS: Chip-Select Input. Serial data is loaded into the shift register while CS is low. The last 16 bits of serial data are latched on CS’s rising edge.\n\nOSC: To use the internal oscillator, connect capacitor from OSC pin to GND pin. To use the external clock, drive OSC with a 1MHz to 8MHz CMOS clock.\n\nThis IC has many registers but we need to configure at least four registers which are\n\nThis register has total of bit from D0 to D7.Its address is 0x04.To configure this register we need to first shift address 0x04 into IC through DIN pin followed by data which need to configure as we need. We need to set or reset only two bits first is E bit and other one is S bit.E bit is Blink enable nit which is set to blink particular Digit. And S bit is use to select mode of operation 0 for shutdown mode and 1 for normal mode. Here we used normal mode and also blink disabled.\n\nThis register is used to select number of Digit we want to display either two or three. Its address is 0x03 and we need to set or reset only D0 bit to select between 2 or 4 Digit.0 for only two digits and 1 for all four.\n\nThis register is use to set intensity for individual digit. Here we set maximum intensity for better displaying. Its address is 0x01 for digit0 and digit 2 and 0x02 for digit1 and digit3.we need to load data 0x0f and 0xf0 means we need to set all four lower bits for digit0&2 and upper bits for digit1&3 to achieve maximum intensity.\n\nThis IC contains eight data registers to store the character data. These registers are arranged in two planes of 4 bytes, called P0 and P1 means each digit have two plan namely P0 & P1. Each digit is represented by 2 bytes of memory, 1 byte in plane P0and the other in plane P1.If we want to blink Display we just need to write data in one plan say P0 and leave plan P1 blank without data. If we don’t want to blink display we just need to write same data in both plans. But remember that to blink display we also need to enable blink mode using ‘E’ blink bit in configuration register.\n\nAbove is given Serial-Data format to write data in to IC-Max-6952.To read or write data in this IC we first need to send read or write Bit means we need to inform IC whether we are going to read or write the data. After that we need to provide address where we want to write data. After address we need to send 8-Bit of data serially. All this bits must need to send serially.\n\nNow to write data in to this IC we must need to follow some steps which is shown in flow diagram below.\n\nFirst we need to make CS pin low which is chip select pin. Means we first need to select or activate chip. After this we need to provide rising edge of clock to send data or address in to shift register. First make CLK low and then send 1Bit of data/address then make CLK high. On each rising edge of clock 1 bit of data will be loaded in shift register. As we need to send total 16Bit of data which contain 1 read/write bit + 7Address bits + 8 data bits we need to repeat this step for 16 times. After sending 16 bit in to shift register we need to make CS pin High to latch 16bits of data from shift register to internal register of Max-6952.\n\nFollowing are steps to write in to MAX-6952.\n\nFig. 4: Flowchart of C Code for 8051 Microcontroller and MAX-6952 IC based LED Display\n\nThis max-6852 IC has total 24 output pins (from O0 to O23) to drive four dot-matrix bar. Above is given connection method of this IC to Dot-matrix bar.O0 toO6 pins of IC is connected to Digit-0 and digit-1 means dot-matrix bar0 &1.Pin no.O7 to O13 of IC is connected to Digit-2 and digit-3.Now pin fromO14 to O18 is connected to Digit-0 and also to Digit-2.Pins fromO19 toO23 is connected to Digit-1 and Digit-3.\n\nThe MAX6952 interfaced with AT89C51 through an SPI-compatible serial interface. The interface has three inputs, clock (CLK), chip-select (CS), and data in (DIN) and one output, data out (DOUT).Here in this project I have used only three input pins.\n\nWe need to configure four registers which are explained earlier. First we need to configure the configuration registers to select normal mode and blink disabled by loading address and data accordingly .We need to send write bit followed by address of configuration register and then data to sets the function. Then we need to set scan limit to select number of digit we want to us. Here we have used four digits so we need to load 0x01 data into scan limit register which has address 0x03.after that we have to set intensity of digit segments so here we set it to maximum using intensity register by loading data 0x0f and 0xf0 for digit0&2 and digit1&3 respectively. All this data must be loaded in to registers by using steps as I mentioned earlier.\n\nAfter setting all this registers as per our requirement we need to provide data to data or digit register that we want to display. The data in the digit registers does not control the digits directly. Instead, the data means ASCII code is used to address a character generator, which stores the data of a 128-character font.\n\nThis IC have built-In ASCII 104 characters so to display any characters we have to just provide ASCII code in Hex to this IC through DIN (Data-Input) pin. We need to load ASCII code for individual digits into plan P0 and plan P1.If we need blinking mode then ASCII code need to be loaded in only one plan and other remains blank. If we don’t want blink mode we just need to write same ASCII in both plan. Here we are going to display ENGINEERS GARAGE without blinking so we need to write ASCII of all this characters in both plans. For example ASCII in hex of character E is 0x45 so we need to store 0x45 in data register of particular digit in both plans.\n\nHere we are going to display message ENGINEERS GARAGE in scrolling manner which is achieved by shifting ASCII of particular character like we have only four digit segment so to display such long message we need to load ASCII of First four character in respective data register then need to shift ASCII of message one by one to achieve this pattern for example we need to write ASCII of “ENGI” into data register then after some delay we need to load ASCII of “NGIE” in to data register and so on. All this data must be loaded in steps as I mentioned. To load ASCII in particular digit we need to send address of that digit followed by ASCII code. Here we disabled the blinking mode so address of digit 0 to digit 3 is 0x60 to 0x63 respectively."

        "document": "After reset of 8051 microcontroller all pins behave as input pins.\n\nTo make a output pin 0(zero) is to be written to that pin.\n\nNow let’s say we have a requirement to write a program to glow LED using Pin P0.0 and it will toggle its state when the button is pressed which is connected at pin P3.2 using polling method.\n\nFirstly, make pin P0.0 as output pin we need to write statement in ‘Embedded C’\n\nMake pin P3.2 as input pin we need to write\n\nWe will be connected one end of button with pin P3.2 and another end with Ground. Now we need to write code if P3.2 pin gets grounded then toggle the state of pin P0.0 pin.\n\nP0.0 = ~P0.0; // this is toggling of pin\n\nNow let’s say we have a requirement to write a program to glow an LED using Pin P0.0 and it will toggle its state when the button is pressed which is connected at pin P3.2 using an interrupt method.\n\nIn this code we first initialize the Pin P0.0 as output pin and Pin P3.2 as Input pin.\n\nOur input pin P3.2 is also INT0 pin that is why we are using the same pin in both the codes so that hardware connection will be same for both requirements.\n\nIn the image below we can see image of TCON (Timer /Counter) register. This register is also used for External hardware interrupt settings using IT0 bit.\n\nThis register is bit addressable hence we can also set one bit at a time.\n\nUsing the TCON register one setting need to be done when to enable Interrupt. Before actually Enabling External Hardware interrupt on pin P3.2.\n\nSo, the question is:\n\nIs it a low level triggered interrupt (i.e., generate interrupt when pin is low) or Edge triggered interrupt that is when High to Low edge is detected. This setting is done by setting IT0 pin of TCON register.\n\nWhen IT0 pin in this register is 1 then its Edge triggered interrupt else it will be level triggered interrupt.\n\nIn this code we will set this pin to Enable interrupt only when High to Low transition occurs at INT0 pin P3.2.\n\nTo Enable External Hardware Interrupt at Pin P3.2 EX0 bit should be set to 1 in Interrupt Enable register which is also bit addressable.\n\nAfter that we need to enable all interrupts using EA pin of Interrupt Enable Register. In the following image we can see that EA pin is the seventh pin of Interrupt Enable Register.\n\nHence our coding sequence will be like this\n\nAfter Doing this we need to write ISR i.e., Interrupt service Routine code for External Hardware Interrupt 0.\n\nInterrupt Vector Table: Whenever any Interrupt occurs then CPU searches for address of IRS inside Interrupt Vector Table. After getting the address of ISR it executes ISR and at the end of ISR there is this RETI (return from interrupt) instruction. This instruction is implicit and, in this instruction, flag due to which ISR is run, is cleared automatically (for most of interrupts except serial) and then CPU returns to the place where it was interrupted. Below is the ISR table along with the priority and its ISR address.\n\nHere “vInt0Interrupt” this is the ISR name and “interrupt 0” written after it ensures that its address is 0003H. It is to be written in this way only.\n\n“RETI” not required explicitly in ‘Embedded C’ as its automatically added in Assembly conversion.\n\n// Need to write code for toggling of P0.0 pin\n\nSo this is all about how to use input output functionality of 8051 microcontroller. Input port of 8051 microcontroller can be used to get input from external peripheral devices like keypad, push buttons, LDR, sensors and so on. These ports can also be connected to LCD displays, Seven Segment Displays, LED Matrix, Relays, Transistors, etc."

        "document": "Welcome to our comprehensive guide on mastering the 8051 microcontroller’s Input/Output (I/O) ports. As seasoned embedded systems engineers, we’ve compiled this extensive resource to help you navigate the intricacies of pin control and maximize your 8051 projects’ potential. Whether you’re a budding engineer or a seasoned professional, this guide will equip you with the knowledge to harness the full power of 8051 I/O functionality.\n\nThe 8051 microcontroller boasts a robust I/O system, featuring four 8-bit bidirectional ports: P0, P1, P2, and P3. Each port provides a gateway for the microcontroller to interact with the external world, allowing for a wide range of applications from simple LED control to complex interfacing with peripherals.\n\nPort 0 is a unique beast in the 8051 family. It’s an 8-bit open-drain bidirectional I/O port, which means:\n• When used as an output, it requires external pull-up resistors\n• It can sink up to eight TTL inputs\n• In its alternate function, it serves as the multiplexed low-order address and data bus during external memory accesses\n\nPort 1 is a straightforward 8-bit bidirectional I/O port with internal pull-ups. Its key features include:\n• Can be used for general-purpose I/O operations\n• Provides alternative functions for Timer/Counter 2 external events and clock inputs\n\nSimilar to Port 1, Port 2 is an 8-bit bidirectional I/O port with internal pull-ups. Its distinctive traits are:\n• Often used for general I/O operations\n• Serves as the high-order address byte during external memory accesses when using 16-bit addresses\n\nPort 3 is perhaps the most versatile of all 8051 ports. It’s an 8-bit bidirectional I/O port with internal pull-ups that also offers a variety of alternate functions:\n• WR and RD for external data memory write and read strobe signals\n\nTo effectively utilize the 8051’s I/O capabilities, understanding how to configure these ports is crucial. Let’s dive into the nitty-gritty of port configuration.\n\nBy default, all ports are configured as inputs upon reset. To set a port or individual pins as outputs, we need to write a ‘1’ to the corresponding bit in the port’s Special Function Register (SFR). Here’s an example in C:\n\nAnd here’s the equivalent in Assembly:\n\nReading from a port is as simple as accessing the port’s SFR. In C:\n\nWriting to a port follows a similar pattern. In C:\n\nNow that we’ve covered the basics, let’s explore some advanced techniques to squeeze every ounce of performance from your 8051 I/O ports.\n\nThe 8051 excels at bit manipulation, allowing for efficient control of individual pins without affecting others. Here’s how you can toggle a single bit in C:\n\nLeveraging the alternate functions of Port 3 can significantly enhance your project’s capabilities. For instance, to set up serial communication:\n\nUtilizing interrupts can make your I/O operations more efficient and responsive. Here’s a simple example of setting up an external interrupt on P3.2 (INT0):\n\nTo squeeze every last drop of performance from your 8051 I/O operations, consider these optimization techniques:\n\nWhen milliseconds count, drop down to assembly. Here’s an ultra-fast port toggle:\n\nThe 8051’s ability to address individual bits in SFRs can lead to more efficient code:\n\nWhen a port is configured for output, reading from it actually reads the latch, not the pin state. To avoid confusion and potential errors, maintain a shadow register in software:\n\nLet’s explore some practical applications to solidify our understanding of 8051 I/O ports.\n\nControlling an 8×8 LED matrix is a classic application that demonstrates the power of efficient I/O manipulation:\n\nThis code creates a simple smiley face on the LED matrix, demonstrating how to multiplex the display using two ports.\n\nInterfacing with a 4×4 keypad is another common task that showcases the 8051’s I/O capabilities:\n\nThis example demonstrates how to use a single port for both input and output operations, efficiently scanning a keypad matrix.\n\nEven with a solid understanding of 8051 I/O ports, you may encounter some common issues. Here are some troubleshooting tips:\n• Floating Inputs: Always use pull-up or pull-down resistors for input pins to avoid unpredictable behavior.\n• Port 0 Output Problems: Remember that Port 0 requires external pull-up resistors when used as an output.\n• Conflicting Alternate Functions: Be cautious when using ports with alternate functions. Ensure that you’re not accidentally activating an unwanted feature.\n• Excessive Current Draw: Be mindful of the current limitations of each pin. Exceeding these can damage your microcontroller or cause erratic behavior.\n• EMI Issues: In noisy environments, consider adding bypass capacitors near the microcontroller and using shielded cables for sensitive I/O lines.\n\nMastering the 8051 microcontroller’s I/O ports opens up a world of possibilities for your embedded systems projects. From basic digital I/O to complex interfacing with external devices, the skills you’ve gained from this guide will serve as a solid foundation for your future endeavors.\n\nRemember, practice makes perfect. Experiment with different configurations, push the boundaries of what you can achieve with these versatile I/O ports, and don’t be afraid to dive into the datasheet for even more advanced features.\n\nAs you continue to explore the vast landscape of embedded systems, keep this guide handy. The principles you’ve learned here will not only apply to the 8051 but will also translate to many other microcontroller families.\n\nHappy coding, and may your pins always be in the right state!"

In this article, we will delve into the block diagram and pinout of the 8051 microcontroller, providing a comprehensive overview of its internal structure and external connections.\n\nThe 8051 microcontroller is an 8-bit microcontroller based on the MCS-51 instruction set architecture, introduced by Intel in the early 1980s. It was the first microcontroller produced by Intel, and was named after its product number \"8051\".\n\nIt is widely used in embedded systems because of its low cost, low power consumption, easy programming and extensive peripheral resource support. It can be used to control various devices and systems, such as home appliance control, industrial automation, electronic instruments, communication devices, etc.\n\nAlthough the 8051 microcontroller has been introduced for many years, it is still widely used in some specific areas due to its stability and wide community support, and many compatible and improved models have been derived. Many companies and manufacturers have introduced their own 8051 microcontroller products, thus further enriching the applications and development.\n• 8-bit architecture: It is an 8-bit microcontroller with each data bit being 8 bits wide and capable of handling 8 bits of data.\n• Harvard architecture: It uses a Harvard architecture, which separates program memory (ROM) from data memory (RAM). This allows instructions and data to be accessed simultaneously, improving the efficiency of the system.\n• Program memory (ROM): It has built-in program memory for storing program code. These memories are usually non-volatile memories (such as ROM or flash memory) and the program code remains intact after a power failure.\n• Data memory (RAM): It has built-in data memory for storing variables, intermediate results, and other data. These memories are usually volatile memories (RAM) and data is lost after a power failure.\n• Clocks and timers: It usually contains one or more built-in timers and counters. These timers can be used for applications such as measuring time intervals, generating accurate time delays, timing, etc.\n• Input/Output (I/O) ports: It has general purpose input/output (GPIO) ports for input and output of digital signals to and from external devices. The GPIO port allows interaction with various sensors, actuators, displays, and other external devices.\n• Serial communication ports: It usually have serial communication ports (such as UART) for serial communication with other devices, such as data transfer with computers, communication with external modules, etc.\n• Interrupt system: It has a built-in interrupt controller that can receive and process interrupt signals from external devices.

This makes the 8051 microcontroller a flexible and scalable solution.\n\nThe block diagram inside the 51 microcontroller can be divided into several parts: CPU, memory (RAM, ROM, FLASH), I/O ports, timer/counter and interrupt system.\n\nThis is the Atmel official data sheet gives the internal structure of the schematic.\n\nCentral processor: including the operator ALU and control logic composition, which also includes a number of special function registers (SFR).\n\nMemory: 51 series of microcontroller memory is used in the program memory and data memory completely separate Haver structure, the two have their own addressing methods, addressing space and control system. The size of the internal data memory and program memory is related to the model, and the external data memory and program memory can also be extended.\n\nI/O port: The previous section has been introduced it is the basis for communication and operation of the chip and peripherals.\n\nTimer / counter: Timer / counter is an important part of the 51 microcontroller, it is like a curriculum, when to let the chip to execute what program, of course, this is only part of its function, it can also output pulse signals, capture external pulses and so on.\n\nInterrupt system: interrupt is simply to interrupt the long in the execution of the program to do another thing, just like we follow the schedule of classes, suddenly the weather forecast that the typhoon is coming, the school are going to be early dismissal. In the 51 microcontroller interrupt is to provide us with the opportunity to set some higher priority than the ordinary program has to deal with some time-sensitive tasks, after the execution of the interrupt event and then resume the execution of the normal program.\n\n8051 series microcontrollers, including the enhanced 52 series, their appearance is basically universal, regardless of the production of that roughly can replace each other, of course, is the plug-in replacement plug-in, SMD replacement SMD! The following use the most basic version to introduce some of it is the pin distribution.\n\nThe 8051 microcontroller pinout includes 40 pins by function can be divided into four types:\n\n1. Power pins: by VCC (+5V) and GND (ground) to provide power.\n\n2. Clock signal pins: from XTAL0 and XTAL1 connected to the crystal to generate the system clock.\n\nRESET is the reset signal input, triggering the chip reset when high.\n\nALE/PROG is the address latch allow signal, which is used as a control signal to latch the low 8-bit address by outputting a pulse signal when using external memory, it can also be used as a 51 MCU with on-chip EPROM to provide programming pulse input.\n\nPSEN is the program memory allow output signal and is used as a chip select signal when using external memory.\n\nEA /VPP is the external program memory address allow input control signal, which allows reading external EPROM when high and disables it when low. Its another function is to be used as input for curing programming voltage, this function is not used much, just understand it.\n\n4. General-purpose input and output pins: ports P0~P3 can be used as input and output ports.\n\nP0 port is an open-drain 8-bit quasi-bidirectional I/O port, external pull-up resistors are required to do the input.\n\nPorts P1~P3 are quasi-bidirectional I/O ports with internal pull-up resistors, where each pin of port P3 also has a second function, such as serial port, external interrupt, timer calculator input, and external RAM read/write enable. In the enhanced chip P1.0 and P1.1 have the second function of timer 2 output signal terminal and timer 2 input capture terminal respectively.\n\nWarm tip: These above information in addition to the textbook, the network has, more information can be obtained on the official website of the chip manufacturer or agent website. Here again, the importance of learning to get the chip manual, many textbooks or the author will not tell you the information in the chip manual may be able to find (now is a person can publish a book, and the person who published the book is not necessarily the actual application of what he wrote, the chip may not work in the same environment, even if you perform the same operation, the results may not be the same).\n\nAtmel AT89 series: Atmel (now Microchip) launched the AT89 series is a widely used 8051 microcontroller series, including AT89C51, AT89S51, AT89C52, AT89S52, etc.\n\nSilicon Labs C8051 series: Silicon Labs' C8051 series is a series of high-performance 8051 microcontrollers with rich peripheral resources and integrated analog functions.
