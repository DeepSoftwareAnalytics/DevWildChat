Some host applications, for example, Microsoft Excel, also automatically add a Help button to the dialog box. If the user chooses OK or presses ENTER, the InputBox function returns whatever is in the text box. If the user chooses Cancel, the function returns a zero-length string (\"\").\n\nThe text box accepts only 255 characters. The return string is truncated to 254 characters.\n\nThe text box does not accept line breaks, such as Shift+Enter. If the user pastes text with a line break in the text box, the text is truncated at the line break.\n\nThis example shows various ways to use the InputBox function to prompt the user to enter a value. If the x and y positions are omitted, the dialog box is automatically centered for the respective axes. The variable contains the value entered by the user if the user chooses OK or presses the ENTER key. If the user chooses Cancel, a zero-length string is returned.\n\nHave questions or feedback about Office VBA or this documentation?

However, you can download a program that will allow you to view Help created in the Windows Help format. \"\n\nBased on all the documentation for InputBox, it seems that it is expecting a .hlp file.

        "document": "We are using passwords of SQL server login inside vb.net code. Here all the developers will come to know the password easily. How can I protect the passwords from developers so that I can say that no one knows the password or only one or two people knows it. Is there any way to encrypt the password ? Or is it possible to put digital sign to the passwords which is used in code ?\n\nDon’t hardcode a password in source code. If the password is compromised it’s not possible to change it. If you’re connecting to a database why are you not using ODBC? That’s where the credentials should be held.\n\nYou can’t protect the password as it has to be decoded to send to the server for authorisation there is nothing stopping someone else with access for running the same routines to get hold of the password themselves. If you absolutely need to restrict access what you should be looking at is switching away from using an embedded SQL Account and instead handling authorisation on a per-user basis using Kerberos, this would allow you grant your users access but restrict your developer, it would also mean that you would not need to embed any usernames or passwords into the application.\n\nSurely you have the SQL Server credentials configured such that they may only be used to connect from the application server’s IP address. Right? If not, start there. Then configure your application server, and it’s code, so that the credentials can be retrieved from somewhere outside the web code and the directory in which that code lives. And ensure that that location is locked down such that only privileged uses (including the application) can get to it.\n\nIf you’re connecting to a database why are you not using ODBC? That’s where the credentials should be held. ODBC? No, just no. Good developers stopped using ODBC long ago. Nothing more of a pain than to have to configure 10 different ODBC connectors to have all your in house software work. Never hardcode credentials. Pass-through the current users credentials from Windows. The user should have access to what is needed, if not then they shouldn’t be running the application in the first place.\n\nIf you’re connecting to a database why are you not using ODBC?

It’s a VB.net app so most likely web based and won’t work well on any browser other than Explorer. Agree about hard coded creds. That’s simply a dev who’s either crap or lazy.\n\nWe run all our UAT/Prod environments within AWS guess who has access? Only the two ITS ppl we have. Devs can’t get into the servers themselves. Anytime they need something they literally stand behind me while I pull it for em. We restricted access on these AWS servers to ITS/Domain Admins only and none of the devs have these perms. Sounds to me like you should be thinking about a perm audit or separating environments if they’re causing issues.\n\nThanks comments, All of you said don’t use password in code, but no one suggested me best alternate method. Can anyone please help me to secure my password with example ? There is no way to do this, it is impossible. Since it has to be able to be decoded in order to pass to SQL this means it can also be decoded in the same way by someone who wanted to get the password. The correct way of doing authentication where you don’t want someone to have access is to use Kerberos like I explained in my respsonse, this uses peoples Windows account details to authenticate to SQL and means that no passwords are stored anywhere so you could put a restriction on the database itself to block access to anyone you don’t want accessing it."

Is there an alternative method of getting the input which will allow me to hide the password?"
