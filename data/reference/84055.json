For those who don’t know what they are, Unicode is a simple and quick way to insert basic characters directly into your web page. It doesn’t require external requests and cuts down on load time. Another benefit is that it is a font, not an image, so when people manually adjust their screen size, the Unicode will adjust as well.\n\nUnicode can be used in both your HTML and CSS in two slightly different ways:\n\nIn your HTML you would use the HTML code:\n\nThe key with the HTML code is to always include the & and # at the beginning of the number and the ; at the end.\n\nThe code above will render an arrow on the page:\n\nThe alternate way to insert unicode characters into your web page is to use it in your CSS files. This is done using pseudo elements like ::before and ::after.\n\nThe benefit of using Unicode in your CSS is that it can be styled independently.\n\nThe mark-up for this looks like this:\n\nWhen using unicode in CSS do not use the HTML code, but instead use the Unicode number. The Unicode sun in the example above has the Unicode number: U+263C. However, when inserting it into your CSS do not include the U or + at the beginning of the number. Instead, replace those two characters with \\.\n\nThe above code will render on your page like this:\n\nAs great as Unicode is there are limitations:\n\n1.The first limitation is a BIG one. When it comes to accessibility, not all screen readers will read out Unicode. Keep in mind that if you are relying solely on Unicode to convey something to your user, that portion of your website may not be accessible to everyone.\n\n2. If a user has their default font changed on their web browser, then unicode may not be able to render in that specific font library. That would cause your character to render like this:\n\n3. Different companies have default emoji’s included in their libraries, which can cause your characters to render differently than you expected. For example the Unicode U+1F60B may originally render as this:\n\nBut it will render differently in different places:\n\nA great website to use to pick your characters is unicode-table.com. When you select the character you’d like to use there are graphics on the page. These graphics tell you how your character of choice is going to render in different places and in different fonts.\n\nDespite these limitations, Unicode is a easy way to add simple but useful content to your page.

        "document": "CSS has a property called . It can only be used with the pseudo-elements and . It is written like a pseudo selector (with the colon), but it’s called a pseudo-element because it’s not actually selecting anything that exists on the page but adding something new to the page. This is what it looks like:\n\nWith this CSS in place, we could have this HTML:\n\nAnd the output would be like:\n\nMaybe that example doesn’t get you drooling, but pseudo-element content can be quite useful and do cool things. Let’s go through some ideas and considerations.\n\nThe first concern might be that of a separation-between-content-and-design purist. You are literally adding text content to the page with CSS content, and that breaks that barrier. The spec is done and the idea implemented, but that doesn’t mean it’s not worth discussing. If you have an opinion about CSS content and its use, please share in the comments.\n\nI think it’s awesome and perfectly suited for CSS. Consider the example above where we preface all elements with a class of with the text “Email address: “. That is a design decision, where for the clarity of content, it was decided that having that text before email addresses made the content more clear. Perhaps in a redesign of the site, there was less room where those email addresses are being displayed and it was decided that instead of prefacing them with text, a small icon would be used instead. This fits with the idea of CSS, in that the HTML content doesn’t need to change at all, this change could be solely accomplished with CSS.\n\nI’m going to publish an article tomorrow with this kind of idea.\n\nIf you need to use a special character in the CSS content, it’s kinda weird. How I do it is I figure out what the ASCII number is for the symbol. This chart of glyphs is handy. So on that chart the copyright © symbol is © – so the ASCII number is 169. Then I drop that number in the Entity Conversion Calculator which will convert it into what you need for CSS.\n\nHere’s some random useful ones:\n\nYou are able to insert attributes of the elements you are targeting as content. For example, an anchor link might have a title attribute:\n\nYou can access that title attribute from the content property like:\n\nAny attribute can be targeted as such, in the format . If you’d like to insert something into the HTML to use for a CSS content purpose (but nothing else), you could use the new attribute prefix in HTML5.\n\nTooltips for links based on the attribute:\n\nThis example uses the attribute, and other examples like this that you find around the web also use the title attribute. It’s probably the correct one to use. However, do note that browsers have their own tooltip popups that they do. When that comes up, it will cover this, and look weird. I tried to take a screenshot of the issue but there it wasn’t letting me for some reason. There is no way to suppress this, other than just not using the attribute. HTML5 attributes, again, could be useful here.\n• Firebug can’t yet target pseduo elements. The web inspector in WebKit browsers can target them, but don’t show their property/values. I heard the IE dev tools could target them too, but not sure about the property/values.\n• In WebKit, they have to be block level to be rotated. Firefox can rotate inline elements/pseudo-elements.\n• They cannot be transitioned or animated.\n\nI had an idea I wanted to try where you would have a vertical list of names, and as you moused over them, their email addresses would slide out from underneath them. To have the HTML be as clean as possible, I thought it would be cool to use the an pseudo-element and a -webkit-transition to make it happen. But, alas, you cannot animate or transition a pseudo-element.\n\nUsing the /content method, I got an example working it just doesn’t slide out like I thought would be cool. Using s I got the idea working, also in the demo page.\n\nAll the major browsers (Firefox 3+, Safari 3+, Chrome 3+, Opera 10+, and Internet Explorer 8+) (See the full chart) support CSS content with the ::after/::before pseudo-elements and the spec is in its full candidate recommendation status.\n\nRegarding accessibility, I’m just not 100% sure what the situation was. I was trying to use VoiceOver with Safari on my Mac with the email popout links demo. For best accessibility, I would think the goal would be to get it to read the whole text, including the CSS content being added. I had trouble getting it to do that, but I thought I did get it to do it once somehow. I was really bad at using VoiceOver and found it frustrating to get it to do what I was trying to do even at the most basic levels. If someone knows more about accessibility as it relates to CSS content, I’m sure we’d all love to know more.\n\nA Whole Bunch of Amazing Stuff Pseudo Elements Can Do"

        "document": "Lately I had some fun with Unicode in CSS and made several interesting background patterns with them. There’s one on Codepen.\n\nI haven’t fully explored the whole Unicode table yet but I’d like to share some methods which are used to build those patterns. Hope this brings you some inspirations for web design.\n\nThe way to use in CSS\n\nUnicode characters can easily be added to the pseudo-elements, and , in the property. The following code displays the arrow '→'.\n\n.element:after { /* The number after slash '\\' is in hexadecimal format. */ content: \"\\2192\"; }\n\nA single character may not look anything special unless there are many of them being put together. One of the most common ways to do this is to put them into a grid.\n\nThe result looks appealing most of the time after applying some random rotations and color palettes to the grid content.\n\nYou can put different characters in the same grid. And if you’re lucky, you would find several ranges of characters that fit together quite well.\n\nBy only looking at the visual aspects of the characters you’ll notice that Unicode provides a rich source of new shapes and patterns, which most of them are hard to draw in CSS.\n\nSometimes with small transformations to the same character, you’ll get slighly different shapes. Take the wave character ‘⌇’ for example.\n\nSo let’s try to make something with random transformation for each one. Here is the result.\n\nOr to place them around a circle along with the transformations.\n\nNote that in first graph above, part of the intersected curves formed by the shapes of the wave characters can be used as background as well.\n\nComparing to the shapes hacked with HTML & CSS, one benefit of using Unicode characters is that it’s easy to add variations through properties like , etc.\n\nWith text mask we can use , and as background to decorate them.\n\nAs for and , one trick here is to randomize its gradient angle to get different visual results.\n\n:after { background: linear-gradient( <angle>, /* ... */ ); } :after { background: conic-gradient( from <angle>, /* ... */ ); }\n\nThe background patterns in this article are all generated with css-doodle. They could also be generated in plain JavaScript or any other programming languages though.\n\nCSS has its limit but I really love the way it is and I’m sure there are more beautiful things to be discovered.\n\nI recently wrote a post — that was shared here on CSS-Tricks — where I looked at ways to use Unicode characters to create interesting (and random) patterns. Since then, I’ve continued to seek new characters to build new patterns. I even borrowed a book about Unicode from a local library.\n\nIt’s all up to your imagination to see the possible patterns a Unicode character can make. Although not all characters are good as patterns, the process is a good exercise for me.\n\nAnd, aside from Unicode itself, the methods to build the patterns may not be so obvious. It usually takes a lot of inspiration and trial and error to come up with new ones.\n\nThere are actually many ways to do tiling. Here’s one of my favorite tile patterns, which can be easily achieved using CSS grid:\n\nGrid Invaders by Miriam Suzanne is a good example of this technique.\n\nNow, what I’m trying to do is put some Unicode characters into this grid. And most importantly, update the value according to the span of its cell.\n\nI only tested with Chrome on Mac. Some of the examples may look awful on other browsers/platforms.\n\nIt’s a bit like the Tag Cloud effect, but with CSS. Lots of patterns can be made this way.\n\nThe of the columns and rows don't always have to be the same value. We can make small modifications by changing how many rows each cell spans:\n\nSince the property scales up/down in both directions (vertically and horizontally), the in the property will be used instead.\n\nAnd here’s another one, made by rotating the inner container of the grid to some degree.\n\nThe triangles also can be drawn with and will be more responsive, but it's nice to do something in a different way.\n\nMore modifications to the layout:\n\nNow follow these transformations for each column.\n\nMany Unicode pairs share some kind of shape with different angles. For example, parentheses, brackets, and arrows with different that go in different directions. We can use this concept to combine the shapes and generate repeatable patterns.\n\nThis pattern uses less-than and greater-than signs for the base:\n\nHere we go with parentheses:\n\nThese are characters we use everyday. However, they give us a fresh look and feeling when they are arranged in a new way.\n\nThere’s another pair of characters, , and . Placing them in the grid and scaling to a proper value connect them together into a seamless pattern:\n\nIt’s like weaving with characters! We can even take it up a notch by rotating things:\n\nLast week, I joined a CodePen Challenge that challenged the group to make a design out of the and elements. As I experimented with them, I noticed that the two tags scaled down automatically when nested.\n\nSo, I tried to put them around a circle:\n\nSuddenly, I realized this method can be used to generate background patterns, too. The results are pretty nice.\n\nThe interesting thing is that changing a single character can end up with very different results.\n\nThat’s all for now! The color palettes used in this article are from Color Hunt and Coolors.co.\n\nThe examples are generated with css-doodle, except for Ring examples in the last section.

This is done using pseudo elements like ::before and ::after.\n\nThe benefit of using Unicode in your CSS is that it can be styled independently.\n\nThe mark-up for this looks like this:\n\nWhen using unicode in CSS do not use the HTML code, but instead use the Unicode number. The Unicode sun in the example above has the Unicode number: U+263C. However, when inserting it into your CSS do not include the U or + at the beginning of the number. Instead, replace those two characters with \\.\n\nThe above code will render on your page like this:\n\nAs great as Unicode is there are limitations:\n\n1.The first limitation is a BIG one. When it comes to accessibility, not all screen readers will read out Unicode. Keep in mind that if you are relying solely on Unicode to convey something to your user, that portion of your website may not be accessible to everyone.\n\n2. If a user has their default font changed on their web browser, then unicode may not be able to render in that specific font library. That would cause your character to render like this:\n\n3. Different companies have default emoji’s included in their libraries, which can cause your characters to render differently than you expected. For example the Unicode U+1F60B may originally render as this:\n\nBut it will render differently in different places:\n\nA great website to use to pick your characters is unicode-table.com. When you select the character you’d like to use there are graphics on the page. These graphics tell you how your character of choice is going to render in different places and in different fonts.\n\nDespite these limitations, Unicode is a easy way to add simple but useful content to your page. Unicode is a great way to add some extra styling and flare to your page!"

There seems to be less info about these \"escaped unicode\" symbols that are used in css. There are other symbols like that I found but no arrows. What are the arrow codes?"
