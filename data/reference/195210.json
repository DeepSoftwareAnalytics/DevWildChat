Following are the code files:\n\nI'm not able to get my audio input and hence it's not drawing anything. I tried in 2 different browsers and got the following in console, hope it helps in debugging:\n\nFirefox: (In Firefox I get nothing, only this error)\n\nChrome: (In Chrome it's just a black canvas and when I speak, the ellipse doesn't show)\n\nI search some github issues and tried to insert the function but no luck.\n\nAnd by the way, I'm using Python Flask server to host it locally for now.\n\nAny solutions, guidance would be really appreciated."

        "document": "Ok great, so we have a sound, and we’ve loaded it. But now we want to hear it. So we need to write code that tells P5 to play the sound.\n• In the setup() function, play the sound when the sketch starts:\n• Click the “Play” button at the top of the code editor to run your p5.js sketch.\n• You’ll hear the “goat.wav” sound file play automatically when the sketch starts. If you don’t hear it but don’t see any errors it may be too quiet. Let’s play with making it louder.\n• You can change the volume by using before the . In p5.js and many other programming languages, the dot (.) notation is used to access and manipulate properties and methods of objects. So when we have created this variable goatSound that represents our sound file, we can use the dot notation to manipulate the properties of this file. Here represents the volume level. Try changing this to or to see it change.\n\nYour full sketch should look like this:\n\nThat’s it! You’ve created a simplified p5.js sketch that plays the sound. Remember to save your project in the web editor so you can access it later.\n• How might you create a button to play the sound?\n• We can then do fun things like change the pitch based on the position of our mouse. Here’s an example!\n\nSince you probably aren’t interested in making a contraption that sounds like a goat…you’re probably wondering “How can I load a larger sound file and one of my own files.” To which I respond, “Great question!”\n\nIn order to do this, you’ll need to run P5.js locally on your machine and run a local web server. This is quite common in software development and used during the development phase before hosting code projects on the cloud. We’ll do this in a future tutorial. For now just be satisfied with with “goat.wav” and the varieties of projects that can be done with “goat.wav.”\n\nIf you’re adament about using other sounds, you can find your own sounds but they’ll need to be smaller than 5mb in order to be hosted on the P5.js web editor. You can find many sounds online here: https://freesound.org/ You’ll need to create an account and most files will need to be downsized."
