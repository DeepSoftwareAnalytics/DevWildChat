        "document": "Cryptography is the study and practice of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries. It deals with developing and analyzing protocols which prevents malicious third parties from retrieving information being shared between two entities thereby following the various aspects of information security.\n\nSecure Communication refers to the scenario where the message or data shared between two parties can’t be accessed by an adversary. In Cryptography, an Adversary is a malicious entity, which aims to retrieve precious information or data thereby undermining the principles of information security.\n\nData Confidentiality, Data Integrity, Authentication and Non-repudiation are core principles of modern-day cryptography.\n• Confidentiality refers to certain rules and guidelines usually executed under confidentiality agreements which ensure that the information is restricted to certain people or places.\n• Data integrity refers to maintaining and making sure that the data stays accurate and consistent over its entire life cycle.\n• Authentication is the process of making sure that the piece of data being claimed by the user belongs to it.\n• Non-repudiation refers to ability to make sure that a person or a party associated with a contract or a communication cannot deny the authenticity of their signature over their document or the sending of a message.\n\nA5/1 is a stream cipher used to provide over-the-air communication privacy in the GSM cellular telephone standard. It is one of several implementations of the A5 security protocol. It was initially kept secret, but became public knowledge through leaks and reverse engineering. A number of serious weaknesses in the cipher have been identified.\n\nA5/1 is used in Europe and the United States. A5/2 was a deliberate weakening of the algorithm for certain export regions. A5/1 was developed in 1987, when GSM was not yet considered for use outside Europe, and A5/2 was developed in 1989. Though both were initially kept secret, the general design was leaked in 1994 and the algorithms were entirely reverse engineered in 1999 by Marc Briceno from a GSM telephone. In 2000, around 130 million GSM customers relied on A5/1 to protect the confidentiality of their voice communications.\n\nSecurity researcher Ross Anderson reported in 1994 that \"there was a terrific row between the NATO signal intelligence agencies in the mid-1980s over whether GSM encryption should be strong or not. The Germans said it should be, as they shared a long border with the Warsaw Pact; but the other countries didn't feel this way, and the algorithm as now fielded is a French design.\"\n\nIt employs three Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) X, Y, and Z.\n\nThe three LFSRs X, Y and Z have lengths equal to 19, 22, and 23 bits respectively. Register X can be represented as (x0, x1, x2, …., x18),\n\n register Y can be represented as (y0, y1, y2, …., y21), and register Z can be represented as (z0, z1, z2, …., z22). Note: 19 + 22 + 23 = 64 bits\n\nA 64-bit key K is used as the initial values in X, Y, and Z registers. After the registers are filled with the key, the keystream is generated through these three registers. The keystream is then XORed with the input bitstream to get the encrypted stream.\n\nThe 14th, 17th, 18th and 19th (x13, x16, x17, x18) bits of register X are XORed and result is saved in a temporary variable (say t). Thereafter, the bits are shifted 1-position to right direction, i.e. bit x17 is shifted to x18, bit x16 is shifted to x17 and so on till x0 is shifted to x1. After shifting, the bit saved in temporary variable t is saved in x0. It can be equated and diagrammatically represented as:\n\nThe 21st and 22nd bits (y20, y21) of register Y are XORed and result is saved in a temporary variable (say t). Thereafter, the bits are shifted 1-position to right direction, i.e. bit y20 is shifted to y21, bit y19 is shifted to y20 and so on till y0 is shifted to y1. After shifting, the bit saved in temporary variable t is saved in y0. It can be equated and represented diagrammatically as:\n\nThe 8th, 21st, 22nd and 23rd bits (z7, z20, z21, z22) of register Z are XORed and result is saved in a temporary variable (say t). Thereafter, the bits are shifted 1-position to right direction, i.e. bit z21 is shifted to z22, bit z20 is shifted to z21 and so on till z0 is shifted to z1. After shifting, the bit saved in temporary variable t is saved in z0. It can be equated and represented diagrammatically as:\n\nIn the generation of keystream, not all three X, Y and Z registers shift. The shifting of registers will be based on the function maj(x8, y10, z10) which is computed as:\n\nIf the majority of bits x8, y10, and z10 are 0, the function returns 0; If the majority of bits x8, y10, and z10 are 1, the function returns 1.\n\nIn A5/1, for each keystream bit that we generate, the following takes place. First, we compute\n\nThen the registers X, Y, and Z shift (or not) as follows:\n• If x8 = m then X shifts, i.e. if the 9th bit of register X is equal to m, the shift operation is applied to register X.\n• If y10 = m then Y shifts, i.e. if the 11th bit of register Y is equal to m, the shift operation is applied to register Y.\n• If z10 = m then Z shifts, i.e. if the 11th bit of register Z is equal to m, the shift operation is applied to register Z.\n\nA few examples of registers’ shift using majority function m:\n\nFinally, a single keystream bit s is generated using the least significant bits from all three registers respectively as:\n\nThis generates only one keystream bit s. The whole keystream S of length n, equal to plaintext, is generated by applying the same steps n times.\n\nThe wiring diagram of A5/1 algorithm can be shown as:\n\nGenerating Ciphertext The keystream generated in the A5/1 algorithm is then XORed with the plaintext to get the ciphertext. That is, plaintext ⊕ keystream = ciphertext\n\nOn the other hand, at the destination, keystream is generated using the same 64 bit key in A5/1 algorithm which is then XORed with the ciphertext to get the plaintext. That is, ciphertext ⊕ keystream = plaintext"

In a typical channel and in one direction, one burst is sent every 4.615 milliseconds and contains 114 bits available for information. A5/1 is used to produce for each burst a 114 bit sequence of keystream which is XORed with the 114 bits prior to modulation. A5/1 is initialised using a 64-bit key together with a publicly known 22-bit frame number. Older fielded GSM implementations using Comp128v1 for key generation, had 10 of the key bits fixed at zero, resulting in an effective key length of 54 bits. This weakness was rectified with the introduction of Comp128v3 which yields proper 64 bits keys. When operating in GPRS / EDGE mode, higher bandwidth radio modulation allows for larger 348 bits frames, and A5/3 is then used in a stream cipher mode to maintain confidentiality.\n\nA5/1 is based around a combination of three linear-feedback shift registers (LFSRs) with irregular clocking. The three shift registers are specified as follows:\n\nThese degrees were not chosen at random: since the degrees of the three registers are relatively prime, the period of this generator is the product of the periods of the three registers. Thus the period of A5/1 (before repetition) is 2^64 bits (2 to the power of 64).\n\nThe bits are indexed with the least significant bit (LSB) as 0.\n\nThe registers are clocked in a stop/go fashion using a majority rule. Each register has an associated clocking bit. At each cycle, the clocking bit of all three registers is examined and the majority bit is determined. A register is clocked if the clocking bit agrees with the majority bit. Hence at each step at least two or three registers are clocked, and each register steps with probability 3/4.\n\nInitially, the registers are set to zero. Then for 64 cycles, the 64-bit secret key K is mixed in according to the following scheme: in cycle , the ith key bit is added to the least significant bit of each register using XOR —\n\nEach register is then clocked.\n\nSimilarly, the 22-bits of the frame number are added in 22 cycles. Then the entire system is clocked using the normal majority clocking mechanism for 100 cycles, with the output discarded. After this is completed, the cipher is ready to produce two 114 bit sequences of output keystream, first 114 for downlink, last 114 for uplink.\n\nA number of attacks on A5/1 have been published, and the American National Security Agency is able to routinely decrypt A5/1 messages according to released internal documents.[3]\n\nSome attacks require an expensive preprocessing stage after which the cipher can be broken in minutes or seconds. Originally, the weaknesses were passive attacks using the known plaintext assumption. In 2003, more serious weaknesses were identified which can be exploited in the ciphertext-only scenario, or by an active attacker. In 2006 Elad Barkan, Eli Biham and Nathan Keller demonstrated attacks against A5/1, A5/3, or even GPRS that allow attackers to tap GSM mobile phone conversations and decrypt them either in real-time, or at any later time.\n\nAccording to professor Jan Arild Audestad, at the standardization process which started in 1982, A5/1 was originally proposed to have a key length of 128 bits. At that time, 128 bits was projected to be secure for at least 15 years. It is now believed that 128 bits would in fact also still be secure until the advent of quantum computing. Audestad, Peter van der Arend, and Thomas Haug says that the British insisted on weaker encryption, with Haug saying he was told by the British delegate that this was to allow the British secret service to eavesdrop more easily. The British proposed a key length of 48 bits, while the West Germans wanted stronger encryption to protect against East German spying, so the compromise became a key length of 54 bits.[4]\n\nThe first attack on the A5/1 was proposed by Ross Anderson in 1994. Anderson's basic idea was to guess the complete content of the registers R1 and R2 and about half of the register R3. In this way the clocking of all three registers is determined and the second half of R3 can be computed.[2]\n\nIn 1997, Golic presented an attack based on solving sets of linear equations which has a time complexity of 240.16 (the units are in terms of number of solutions of a system of linear equations which are required).\n\nIn 2000, Alex Biryukov, Adi Shamir and David Wagner showed that A5/1 can be cryptanalysed in real time using a time-memory tradeoff attack,[5] based on earlier work by Jovan Golic.[6] One tradeoff allows an attacker to reconstruct the key in one second from two minutes of known plaintext or in several minutes from two seconds of known plain text, but he must first complete an expensive preprocessing stage which requires 248 steps to compute around 300 GB of data. Several tradeoffs between preprocessing, data requirements, attack time and memory complexity are possible.\n\nThe same year, Eli Biham and Orr Dunkelman also published an attack on A5/1 with a total work complexity of 239.91 A5/1 clockings given 220.8 bits of known plaintext. The attack requires 32 GB of data storage after a precomputation stage of 238.[7]\n\nEkdahl and Johansson published an attack on the initialisation procedure which breaks A5/1 in a few minutes using two to five minutes of conversation plaintext.[8] This attack does not require a preprocessing stage. In 2004, Maximov et al. improved this result to an attack requiring \"less than one minute of computations, and a few seconds of known conversation\". The attack was further improved by Elad Barkan and Eli Biham in 2005.[9]\n\nIn 2003, Barkan et al. published several attacks on GSM encryption.[10] The first is an active attack. GSM phones can be convinced to use the much weaker A5/2 cipher briefly. A5/2 can be broken easily, and the phone uses the same key as for the stronger A5/1 algorithm. A second attack on A5/1 is outlined, a ciphertext-only time-memory tradeoff attack which requires a large amount of precomputation.\n\nIn 2006, Elad Barkan, Eli Biham, Nathan Keller published the full version of their 2003 paper, with attacks against A5/X сiphers. The authors claim:[11]\n\nWe present a very practical ciphertext-only cryptanalysis of GSM encrypted communication, and various active attacks on the GSM protocols. These attacks can even break into GSM networks that use \"unbreakable\" ciphers. We first describe a ciphertext-only attack on A5/2 that requires a few dozen milliseconds of encrypted off-the-air cellular conversation and finds the correct key in less than a second on a personal computer. We extend this attack to a (more complex) ciphertext-only attack on A5/1. We then describe new (active) attacks on the protocols of networks that use A5/1, A5/3, or even GPRS. These attacks exploit flaws in the GSM protocols, and they work whenever the mobile phone supports a weak cipher such as A5/2. We emphasize that these attacks are on the protocols, and are thus applicable whenever the cellular phone supports a weak cipher, for example, they are also applicable for attacking A5/3 networks using the cryptanalysis of A5/1. Unlike previous attacks on GSM that require unrealistic information, like long known plaintext periods, our attacks are very practical and do not require any knowledge of the content of the conversation. Furthermore, we describe how to fortify the attacks to withstand reception errors. As a result, our attacks allow attackers to tap conversations and decrypt them either in real-time, or at any later time.\n\nIn 2007 Universities of Bochum and Kiel started a research project to create a massively parallel FPGA-based cryptographic accelerator COPACOBANA. COPACOBANA was the first commercially available solution[12] using fast time-memory trade-off techniques that could be used to attack the popular A5/1 and A5/2 algorithms, used in GSM voice encryption, as well as the Data Encryption Standard (DES). It also enables brute force attacks against GSM eliminating the need of large precomputed lookup tables.\n\nIn 2008, the group The Hackers Choice launched a project to develop a practical attack on A5/1. The attack requires the construction of a large look-up table of approximately 3 terabytes. Together with the scanning capabilities developed as part of the sister project, the group expected to be able to record any GSM call or SMS encrypted with A5/1, and within about 3–5 minutes derive the encryption key and hence listen to the call and read the SMS in clear. But the tables weren't released.[13]\n\nA similar effort, the A5/1 Cracking Project, was announced at the 2009 Black Hat security conference by cryptographers Karsten Nohl and Sascha Krißler. It created the look-up tables using Nvidia GPGPUs via a peer-to-peer distributed computing architecture. Starting in the middle of September 2009, the project ran the equivalent of 12 Nvidia GeForce GTX 260. According to the authors, the approach can be used on any cipher with key size up to 64-bits.[14]\n\nIn December 2009, the A5/1 Cracking Project attack tables for A5/1 were announced by Chris Paget and Karsten Nohl. The tables use a combination of compression techniques, including rainbow tables and distinguished point chains. These tables constituted only parts of the 1.7 TB completed table and had been computed during three months using 40 distributed CUDA nodes and then published over BitTorrent.[13][14][15][16] More recently the project has announced a switch to faster ATI Evergreen code, together with a change in the format of the tables and Frank A. Stevenson announced breaks of A5/1 using the ATI generated tables.[17]\n\nDocuments leaked by Edward Snowden in 2013 state that the NSA \"can process encrypted A5/1\".[18]\n\nSince the degrees of the three LFSRs are relatively prime, the period of this generator is the product of the periods of the three LFSRs, which represents 2^64 bits (2 to the power of 64).\n\nOne might think of using A5/1 as pseudo-random generator with a 64-bit initialization seed (key size), but it is not reliable. It loses its randomness after only 8 MB (which represents the period of the largest of the three registers).[19]\n• KASUMI, also known as A5/3\n• None Rose, Greg (10 September 2003). \"A precis of the new attacks on GSM encryption\" .

        "document": "Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSR) are interesting objects in the domain of digital systems, cryptography, and error detection. They are used in conjunction with each other and are valuable in the production of pseudo-random numbers and the optimization of digital circuits. Whether you are into details of computer technology or have an intention to explore high technology, comprehending LFSRs can unlock numerous prospectuses – from secured communication to optimal data storage. This tutorial on LFSRs will help you understand their purpose, operation, and usefulness so that you can truly consider their significance towards the advancement in technology.\n\nLinear Feedback Shift Registers are a type of shift register used in digital circuits which function sequentially; therefore when a clock is provided, it can shift its contents by less than one whole bit. The difference of the LFSR is that input — the bit that is fed back into the register — has linear feedback depending on the current state of the register. Often this function is an XOR of some of the bits of the register.\n• Pseudo-Randomness : FLSRS can produce pseudo-random sequences which vary periodically, this means that they have registered sequences in a fixed cycle.\n• Efficiency : They are executed using shifts and XOR operations, which are straightforward and optimal in terms of the number of operations.\n• Periodicity : The number of bits that can be produced by an LFSR is based on its characteristic polynomial and can be as large as 2^n-1 for an n-bit LFSR.\n• Predictability : Although the sequences are pseudo-random, the state of the generator along with the characteristic polynomial lets a person predict the whole sequence.\n• Shift Registe r: A group of unique flip-flops (often D-type) arranged in a cascade where the output of one flip-flop is linked to the input of the subsequent one. The number of flip-flops defines the length of the LFSR (n).\n• Feedback Function : A linear form (commonly XOR gates) to decide on a new input to the first flip flops by comparing the present status of desired bits (taps) in the shift register. The feedback function is thus determined by the characteristic polynomial of the LFSR.\n• None Taps: Special bit locations in the shift register from which values are taken for use by the feedback function. A decision regarding taps is essential since it determines characteristic polynomials and alters the sequence properties.\n• None Initial State: The least significant binary value is first shifted into the shift register. This state must be non-zero, for the LFSR to be effective, and provide a sequence of the desired maximal length.\n• Clock Signal : A signal that will be used to launch or synchronize the shifting process. On each clock pulse the register moves the content of the register one bit to the right (or left) and the feedback function determines the new bit that is moved to the first\n• None The shift register is set to an initial state which is a non-zero state say a binary word stored in shift register flip flops.\n• None As we said, the bit at the last position of the shift register leaves the register on each clock pulse, and all the other then move one place to the right (or left).\n• None The feedback function determines a new bit depending on the state of certain taps (selected bits) in the shift register. These taps are selected based on the characteristic polynomial of the LFSR.\n• None In general, the feedback function is an exclusive OR of the values of the tapped bits in the shift register. This produces shift register output and it becomes the new input to shift register, and the process continues until the desired number of bits is shifted.\n• None During the shift operation, a new bit is computed by the feedback function and loaded into the first flip-flop of the shift register.\n• None In the first register, the data simply latches on the rising edge of the clock- this is the data that has been shifted out or the feedback data.\n• None The sequential value generated from the output bits is the bits shifted out of the register (or an individual bit in the register). This sequence can be used for a wide range of applications including but not limited to pseudo-random number generation, cryptography and digital signal processing.\n• Configuration : Fibonacci LFSR; the feedback bit is generated by an XOR operation on predetermined bits (taps) of the register and is clocked into the input of the first D-FF.\n• Characteristics : This type is generally simple and very easy to implement as a strategy. A state of the register is shifted, to the right (or left), one position on each clock pulse.\n• Applications: Often employed in the generation of string numbers, smoothers as well as in encryption systems.\n• Example: For the specific 4-bit LFSR with taps at positions 4 and 1 the feedback function is x^4 + x + 1\n• Configuration : In a Galois LFSR, there is an effect of feedback bits on several positions in the register only. It is exactly the feedback that gets applied to some of the taps and consequently, the bits are shifted.\n• Characteristics: More efficient from the implementation point of view of hardware because it can compute more than one operation at a time. This might be faster than the Fibonacci LFSR especially due to the assistance of the feedback mechanism.\n• Applications: It is especially used in cryptography and digital signal processing where speed is a very important aspect.\n• Example: In a 4-bit Galois LFSR with taps located at 4, 1 the feedback is with the input that is fed to the register as well as taps directly.\n• Configuration: The difference is that in NLFSRs, the feedback function is not only XOR but a non-linear function.\n• Characteristics: They can generate longer and less deterministic patterns which increases the security and the randomness. Yet, they pose more difficulties in terms of analysis and application.\n• Applications: Applied in cases with more significant demands for protection for the same reason as the enhanced difficulty of the sequenced patterns.\n• Example: Non-linear operations such as AND, and OR, may be used in the feedback function choice out of selected bits.\n• Configuration : These LFSRs are approximate of longer LFSRs and only a particular number of the bits are used to form the output sequence.\n• Characteristics : They retain some characteristics of longer LFSR but are less than that of LFSR and have shorter period sequences.\n• Applications : Simpler than full LFSR sequence working well where a less sequence is potential and the full LFSR complexity is not needed.\n• Configuration : These LFSRs can also have their tap positions changed, in such a manner that a different characteristic polynomial can be assumed.\n• Characteristics : Ease of use and versatility as the user can inter-changeable ses to different polynomials and lengths of the sequence.\n• Applications : Utilized in systems where different sequences are necessary for the same system at a given time, including adaptive cryptographic systems and reconfigurable hardware.\n• Example : An LFSR that has programmable taps so that it can operate different shift right functions such as x^4 + x^3 + 1 & x^4 + x + 1\n• Stream Ciphers: LFSRs are involved in stream cyphers in the generation of keystreams for and decryption of data. Some examples include those used in the GSM mobile communication system such as the A5/1 and A5/2.\n• CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check): LFSRs are often used in computing the s which are checked sums used to check for any shift or modification of the raw data over digital networks and storage media.\n• None Simulation and Modeling: LFSRs produce pseudo-random numbers that are used in simulations, modelling, and testing.\n• Scrambling : In communication systems, LFSRs are used to increase the quality of the signal with the addition of confusion by clearing up the patterns.\n• Fault Detection : They assist in identifying faults during the manufacturing and operations process of printed circuit board (\n• Pattern Generation: LFSRs help in the development of deterministic sequences that find application in data compressing where storage and transmission sizes dictate the solution’s viability.\n• Design: Circuits of LFSRs are quite easy to construct or program since they consist of a simple sequence of operations. They mainly employ shift registers and XOR gates, which are relatively primitive electronic circuits.\n• Speed: As a result of its shift and XOR-based arithmetic, LFSRs are capable of high speed and are therefore used in high-speed applications.\n• Maximal Length Sequences: The LFSRs if properly designed are capable of generating maximal length sequences and thus have a period of 2^n-1 for an n-bit register. This is especially significant for the cases where one needs long pseudo-random sequences.\n• Configurable Taps: An LFSR feedback taps can be manipulated in such a way that many different sequences can be generated depending on the need.\n• Low Hardware Overhead: The advantage of LFSRs is that in terms of hardware, they are less demanding as compared to other PRNGs or cryptographic devices.\n• Deterministic Nature: based on the initial state and the characteristic polynomial, there are still all the sequences generated by an LFSR. This is an important disadvantage and could be a major issue in cryptographic applications where unpredictability is important.\n• Pseudo-Random Sequences: The sequences produced by an LFSR are Pseudo-random, as against being random. In case high random number generation is required, for instance, in generating cryptographic keys, LFSRs may not be sufficient to implement.\n• Suboptimal Polynomials: If the characteristic polynomial is not primitive then the LFSR will produce sequences with shorter periods in contrast with the maximal period of 2^n - 1. This can limit the performance of the LFSR particularly in applications that demand longer sequences.\n• Cryptographic Weaknesses: LFSRs with linear feedback are comprised of several universal cryptographic attacks such as correlation attacks and linear complexity attacks. These weaknesses are as follows and can threaten the security of systems that use LFSR-based pseudorandom sequences.\n• Poor Non-Linear Correlation: In some cases, the randomness characteristics of LFSRs may be poor when non-linear relations are needed for the generation. This can be a disadvantage in those applications that require non-linear transformations or complex mixing functions.\n\nIn conclusion, LFSRs are important elements in digital systems and provide effective and easy ways to obtain PRSs. They are easy to implement, work fast and do not require much hardware, thus making them suitable for uses such as cryptography, error detection, use in digital signal processing. However, they are relatively predictable and easy to attack and, thus are not suitable for highly secure applications. However, since these limitations still exist in the present-day LFSR, they remain useful when used alongside other cryptographic techniques that would make it more efficient.\n\nWhat is a characteristic polynomial in an LFSR?\n\nCan LFSRs be used in software implementations?\n\nHow do LFSRs differ from True Random Number Generators (TRNGs)?"

        "document": "In computing, a linear-feedback shift register (LFSR) is a shift register whose input bit is a linear function of its previous state.\n\nThe most commonly used linear function of single bits is exclusive-or (XOR). Thus, an LFSR is most often a shift register whose input bit is driven by the XOR of some bits of the overall shift register value.\n\nThe initial value of the LFSR is called the seed, and because the operation of the register is deterministic, the stream of values produced by the register is completely determined by its current (or previous) state. Likewise, because the register has a finite number of possible states, it must eventually enter a repeating cycle. However, an LFSR with a well-chosen feedback function can produce a sequence of bits that appears random and has a very long cycle.\n\nApplications of LFSRs include generating pseudo-random numbers, pseudo-noise sequences, fast digital counters, and whitening sequences. Both hardware and software implementations of LFSRs are common.\n\nThe mathematics of a cyclic redundancy check, used to provide a quick check against transmission errors, are closely related to those of an LFSR.[1] In general, the arithmetics behind LFSRs makes them very elegant as an object to study and implement. One can produce relatively complex logics with simple building blocks. However, other methods, that are less elegant but perform better, should be considered as well.\n\nThe bit positions that affect the next state are called the taps. In the diagram the taps are [16,14,13,11]. The rightmost bit of the LFSR is called the output bit, which is always also a tap. To obtain the next state, the tap bits are XOR-ed sequentially; then, all bits are shifted one place to the right, with the rightmost bit being discarded, and that result of XOR-ing the tap bits is fed back into the now-vacant leftmost bit. To obtain the pseudorandom output stream, read the rightmost bit after each state transition.\n• A maximum-length LFSR produces an m-sequence (i.e., it cycles through all possible 2m − 1 states within the shift register except the state where all bits are zero), unless it contains all zeros, in which case it will never change.\n• As an alternative to the XOR-based feedback in an LFSR, one can also use XNOR. 2 This function is an affine map, not strictly a linear map, but it results in an equivalent polynomial counter whose state is the complement of the state of an LFSR. A state with all ones is illegal when using an XNOR feedback, in the same way as a state with all zeroes is illegal when using XOR. This state is considered illegal because the counter would remain \"locked-up\" in this state. This method can be advantageous in hardware LFSRs using flip-flops that start in a zero state, as it does not start in a lockup state, meaning that the register does not need to be seeded in order to begin operation.\n\nThe sequence of numbers generated by an LFSR or its XNOR counterpart can be considered a binary numeral system just as valid as Gray code or the natural binary code.\n\nThe arrangement of taps for feedback in an LFSR can be expressed in finite field arithmetic as a polynomial mod 2. This means that the coefficients of the polynomial must be 1s or 0s. This is called the feedback polynomial or reciprocal characteristic polynomial. For example, if the taps are at the 16th, 14th, 13th and 11th bits (as shown), the feedback polynomial is\n\nThe \"one\" in the polynomial does not correspond to a tap – it corresponds to the input to the first bit (i.e. x0, which is equivalent to 1). The powers of the terms represent the tapped bits, counting from the left. The first and last bits are always connected as an input and output tap respectively.\n\nThe LFSR is maximal-length if and only if the corresponding feedback polynomial is primitive over the Galois field GF(2).[3][4] This means that the following conditions are necessary (but not sufficient):\n• The number of taps is even.\n• The set of taps is setwise co-prime; i.e., there must be no divisor other than 1 common to all taps.\n\nTables of primitive polynomials from which maximum-length LFSRs can be constructed are given below and in the references.\n\nThere can be more than one maximum-length tap sequence for a given LFSR length. Also, once one maximum-length tap sequence has been found, another automatically follows. If the tap sequence in an n-bit LFSR is [n, A, B, C, 0], where the 0 corresponds to the x0 = 1 term, then the corresponding \"mirror\" sequence is [n, n − C, n − B, n − A, 0]. So the tap sequence [32, 22, 2, 1, 0] has as its counterpart [32, 31, 30, 10, 0]. Both give a maximum-length sequence.\n\nAn example in C is below:\n\nIf a fast parity or popcount operation is available, the feedback bit can be computed more efficiently as the dot product of the register with the characteristic polynomial:\n• . (The turns the popcnt into a true parity function, but the bitshift later makes higher bits irrelevant.)\n\nIf a rotation operation is available, the new state can be computed as\n\nThis LFSR configuration is also known as standard, many-to-one or external XOR gates. The alternative Galois configuration is described in the next section.\n\nA sample python implementation of a similar (16 bit taps at [16,15,13,4]) Fibonacci LFSR would be\n\nWhere a register of 16 bits is used and the xor tap at the fourth, 13th, 15th and sixteenth bit establishes a maximum sequence length.\n\nNamed after the French mathematician Évariste Galois, an LFSR in Galois configuration, which is also known as modular, internal XORs, or one-to-many LFSR, is an alternate structure that can generate the same output stream as a conventional LFSR (but offset in time).[5] In the Galois configuration, when the system is clocked, bits that are not taps are shifted one position to the right unchanged. The taps, on the other hand, are XORed with the output bit before they are stored in the next position. The new output bit is the next input bit. The effect of this is that when the output bit is zero, all the bits in the register shift to the right unchanged, and the input bit becomes zero. When the output bit is one, the bits in the tap positions all flip (if they are 0, they become 1, and if they are 1, they become 0), and then the entire register is shifted to the right and the input bit becomes 1.\n\nTo generate the same output stream, the order of the taps is the counterpart (see above) of the order for the conventional LFSR, otherwise the stream will be in reverse. Note that the internal state of the LFSR is not necessarily the same. The Galois register shown has the same output stream as the Fibonacci register in the first section. A time offset exists between the streams, so a different startpoint will be needed to get the same output each cycle.\n• Galois LFSRs do not concatenate every tap to produce the new input (the XORing is done within the LFSR, and no XOR gates are run in serial, therefore the propagation times are reduced to that of one XOR rather than a whole chain), thus it is possible for each tap to be computed in parallel, increasing the speed of execution.\n• In a software implementation of an LFSR, the Galois form is more efficient, as the XOR operations can be implemented a word at a time: only the output bit must be examined individually.\n\nBelow is a C code example for the 16-bit maximal-period Galois LFSR example in the figure:\n\nThe branch can also be written as which may produce more efficient code on some compilers. In addition, the left-shifting variant may produce even better code, as the msb is the carry from the addition of to itself.\n\nState and resulting bits can also be combined and computed in parallel. The following function calculates the next 64 bits using the 63-bit polynomial :\n\nBinary Galois LFSRs like the ones shown above can be generalized to any q-ary alphabet {0, 1, ..., q − 1} (e.g., for binary, q = 2, and the alphabet is simply {0, 1}). In this case, the exclusive-or component is generalized to addition modulo-q (note that XOR is addition modulo 2), and the feedback bit (output bit) is multiplied (modulo-q) by a q-ary value, which is constant for each specific tap point. Note that this is also a generalization of the binary case, where the feedback is multiplied by either 0 (no feedback, i.e., no tap) or 1 (feedback is present). Given an appropriate tap configuration, such LFSRs can be used to generate Galois fields for arbitrary prime values of q.\n\nAs shown by George Marsaglia[6] and further analysed by Richard P. Brent,[7] linear feedback shift registers can be implemented using XOR and Shift operations. This approach lends itself to fast execution in software because these operations typically map efficiently into modern processor instructions.\n\nBelow is a C code example for a 16-bit maximal-period Xorshift LFSR using the 7,9,13 triplet from John Metcalf:[8]\n\nBinary LFSRs of both Fibonacci and Galois configurations can be expressed as linear functions using matrices in (see GF(2)).[9] Using the companion matrix of the characteristic polynomial of the LFSR and denoting the seed as a column vector , the state of the register in Fibonacci configuration after steps is given by\n\nMatrix for the corresponding Galois form is :\n\nthe top coefficient of the column vector :\n\ngives the term a of the original sequence.\n\nThe following table lists examples of maximal-length feedback polynomials (primitive polynomials) for shift-register lengths up to 24. The formalism for maximum-length LFSRs was developed by Solomon W. Golomb in his 1967 book.[10] The number of different primitive polynomials grows exponentially with shift-register length and can be calculated exactly using Euler's totient function[11] (sequence A011260 in the OEIS).\n• Ones and zeroes occur in \"runs\". The output stream 1110010, for example, consists of four runs of lengths 3, 2, 1, 1, in order. In one period of a maximal LFSR, 2n−1 runs occur (in the example above, the 3-bit LFSR has 4 runs). Exactly half of these runs are one bit long, a quarter are two bits long, up to a single run of zeroes n − 1 bits long, and a single run of ones n bits long. This distribution almost equals the statistical expectation value for a truly random sequence. However, the probability of finding exactly this distribution in a sample of a truly random sequence is rather low[ ].\n• LFSR output streams are deterministic. If the present state and the positions of the XOR gates in the LFSR are known, the next state can be predicted. 12 This is not possible with truly random events. With maximal-length LFSRs, it is much easier to compute the next state, as there are only an easily limited number of them for each length.\n• The output stream is reversible; an LFSR with mirrored taps will cycle through the output sequence in reverse order.\n• The value consisting of all zeros cannot appear. Thus an LFSR of length n cannot be used to generate all 2n values.\n\nLFSRs can be implemented in hardware, and this makes them useful in applications that require very fast generation of a pseudo-random sequence, such as direct-sequence spread spectrum radio. LFSRs have also been used for generating an approximation of white noise in various programmable sound generators.\n\nThe repeating sequence of states of an LFSR allows it to be used as a clock divider or as a counter when a non-binary sequence is acceptable, as is often the case where computer index or framing locations need to be machine-readable.[12] LFSR counters have simpler feedback logic than natural binary counters or Gray-code counters, and therefore can operate at higher clock rates. However, it is necessary to ensure that the LFSR never enters a lockup state (all zeros for a XOR based LFSR, and all ones for a XNOR based LFSR), for example by presetting it at start-up to any other state in the sequence. It is possible to count up and down with a LFSR. LFSR have also been used as a Program Counter for CPUs, this requires that the program itself is \"scrambled\" and it done to save on gates when they are a premium (using fewer gates than an adder) and for speed (as a LFSR does not require a long carry chain).\n\nThe table of primitive polynomials shows how LFSRs can be arranged in Fibonacci or Galois form to give maximal periods. One can obtain any other period by adding to an LFSR that has a longer period some logic that shortens the sequence by skipping some states.\n\nLFSRs have long been used as pseudo-random number generators for use in stream ciphers, due to the ease of construction from simple electromechanical or electronic circuits, long periods, and very uniformly distributed output streams. However, an LFSR is a linear system, leading to fairly easy cryptanalysis. For example, given a stretch of known plaintext and corresponding ciphertext, an attacker can intercept and recover a stretch of LFSR output stream used in the system described, and from that stretch of the output stream can construct an LFSR of minimal size that simulates the intended receiver by using the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm. This LFSR can then be fed the intercepted stretch of output stream to recover the remaining plaintext.\n\nThree general methods are employed to reduce this problem in LFSR-based stream ciphers:\n• Non-linear combination of several bits from the LFSR state;\n• Non-linear combination of the output bits of two or more LFSRs (see also: shrinking generator); or using Evolutionary algorithm to introduce non-linearity. 13\n• Irregular clocking of the LFSR, as in the alternating step generator.\n\nImportant LFSR-based stream ciphers include A5/1 and A5/2, used in GSM cell phones, E0, used in Bluetooth, and the shrinking generator. The A5/2 cipher has been broken and both A5/1 and E0 have serious weaknesses.[14][15]\n\nThe linear feedback shift register has a strong relationship to linear congruential generators.[16]\n\nLFSRs are used in circuit testing for test-pattern generation (for exhaustive testing, pseudo-random testing or pseudo-exhaustive testing) and for signature analysis.\n\nComplete LFSR are commonly used as pattern generators for exhaustive testing, since they cover all possible inputs for an n-input circuit. Maximal-length LFSRs and weighted LFSRs are widely used as pseudo-random test-pattern generators for pseudo-random test applications.\n\nIn built-in self-test (BIST) techniques, storing all the circuit outputs on chip is not possible, but the circuit output can be compressed to form a signature that will later be compared to the golden signature (of the good circuit) to detect faults. Since this compression is lossy, there is always a possibility that a faulty output also generates the same signature as the golden signature and the faults cannot be detected. This condition is called error masking or aliasing. BIST is accomplished with a multiple-input signature register (MISR or MSR), which is a type of LFSR. A standard LFSR has a single XOR or XNOR gate, where the input of the gate is connected to several \"taps\" and the output is connected to the input of the first flip-flop. A MISR has the same structure, but the input to every flip-flop is fed through an XOR/XNOR gate. For example, a 4-bit MISR has a 4-bit parallel output and a 4-bit parallel input. The input of the first flip-flop is XOR/XNORd with parallel input bit zero and the \"taps\". Every other flip-flop input is XOR/XNORd with the preceding flip-flop output and the corresponding parallel input bit. Consequently, the next state of the MISR depends on the last several states opposed to just the current state. Therefore, a MISR will always generate the same golden signature given that the input sequence is the same every time. Recent applications[17] are proposing set-reset flip-flops as \"taps\" of the LFSR. This allows the BIST system to optimise storage, since set-reset flip-flops can save the initial seed to generate the whole stream of bits from the LFSR. Nevertheless, this requires changes in the architecture of BIST, is an option for specific applications.\n\nTo prevent short repeating sequences (e.g., runs of 0s or 1s) from forming spectral lines that may complicate symbol tracking at the receiver or interfere with other transmissions, the data bit sequence is combined with the output of a linear-feedback register before modulation and transmission. This scrambling is removed at the receiver after demodulation. When the LFSR runs at the same bit rate as the transmitted symbol stream, this technique is referred to as scrambling. When the LFSR runs considerably faster than the symbol stream, the LFSR-generated bit sequence is called chipping code. The chipping code is combined with the data using exclusive or before transmitting using binary phase-shift keying or a similar modulation method. The resulting signal has a higher bandwidth than the data, and therefore this is a method of spread-spectrum communication. When used only for the spread-spectrum property, this technique is called direct-sequence spread spectrum; when used to distinguish several signals transmitted in the same channel at the same time and frequency, it is called code-division multiple access.\n\nNeither scheme should be confused with encryption or encipherment; scrambling and spreading with LFSRs do not protect the information from eavesdropping. They are instead used to produce equivalent streams that possess convenient engineering properties to allow robust and efficient modulation and demodulation.\n• Data transfer over PSTN (according to the ITU-T V-series recommendations)\n• 1000BASE-T Ethernet, the most common form of Gigabit Ethernet, scrambles bits using an LFSR\n• Bluetooth Low Energy Link Layer is making use of LFSR (referred to as whitening)\n• Satellite navigation systems such as GPS and GLONASS. All current systems use LFSR outputs to generate some or all of their ranging codes (as the chipping code for CDMA or DSSS) or to modulate the carrier without data (like GPS L2 CL ranging code). GLONASS also uses frequency-division multiple access combined with DSSS.\n\nLFSRs are also used in radio jamming systems to generate pseudo-random noise to raise the noise floor of a target communication system.\n\nThe German time signal DCF77, in addition to amplitude keying, employs phase-shift keying driven by a 9-stage LFSR to increase the accuracy of received time and the robustness of the data stream in the presence of noise.[19]\n• LFSR and Intrinsic Generation of Randomness: Notes From NKS"

The limited periodicity in sequence generation of Linear Feedback Shift Registers can restrict the complexity and randomness of the output, making it easier for adversaries to predict and manipulate the generated sequences for malicious purposes. These factors cumulatively contribute to the weakened defense mechanisms against cyber threats in systems employing Linear Feedback Shift Registers.\n\nHow Can a Linear Feedback Shift Register Be Implemented in Cybersecurity?\n\nImplementing Linear Feedback Shift Registers in cybersecurity involves utilizing them in stream ciphers for data encryption, integrating them with hash functions for secure computation, and employing them in key generation processes to enhance system security.\n\nLinear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) are versatile tools that play a crucial role in safeguarding sensitive data and securing communication channels against potential threats.
