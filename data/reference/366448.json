        "document": "Represents a cell, a row, a column, a selection of cells containing one or more contiguous blocks of cells, or a 3D range.\n\nThe default member of Range forwards calls without parameters to the Value property and calls with parameters to the Item member. Accordingly, is equivalent to , to and to .\n\nThe following properties and methods for returning a Range object are described in the Example section:\n• Range and Cells properties of the Worksheet object\n• Range and Cells properties of the Range object\n• Rows and Columns properties of the Worksheet object\n• Rows and Columns properties of the Range object\n\nUse Range (arg), where arg names the range, to return a Range object that represents a single cell or a range of cells. The following example places the value of cell A1 in cell A5.\n\nThe following example fills the range A1:H8 with random numbers by setting the formula for each cell in the range. When it's used without an object qualifier (an object to the left of the period), the Range property returns a range on the active sheet. If the active sheet isn't a worksheet, the method fails.\n\nUse the Activate method of the Worksheet object to activate a worksheet before you use the Range property without an explicit object qualifier.\n\nThe following example clears the contents of the range named Criteria.\n\nUse Cells on a worksheet to obtain a range consisting all single cells on the worksheet. You can access single cells via Item(row, column), where row is the row index and column is the column index. Item can be omitted since the call is forwarded to it by the default member of Range. The following example sets the value of cell A1 to 24 and of cell B1 to 42 on the first sheet of the active workbook.\n\nThe following example sets the formula for cell A2.\n\nAlthough you can also use to return cell A1, there may be times when the Cells property is more convenient because you can use a variable for the row or column. The following example creates column and row headings on Sheet1. Be aware that after the worksheet has been activated, the Cells property can be used without an explicit sheet declaration (it returns a cell on the active sheet).\n\nUse_expression_.Cells, where expression is an expression that returns a Range object, to obtain a range with the same address consisting of single cells. On such a range, you access single cells via Item(row, column), where are relative to the upper-left corner of the first area of the range. Item can be omitted since the call is forwarded to it by the default member of Range. The following example sets the formula for cell C5 and D5 of the first sheet of the active workbook.\n\nUse Range (cell1, cell2), where cell1 and cell2 are Range objects that specify the start and end cells, to return a Range object. The following example sets the border line style for cells A1:J10.\n\nUse Rows on a worksheet to obtain a range consisting all rows on the worksheet. You can access single rows via Item(row), where row is the row index. Item can be omitted since the call is forwarded to it by the default member of Range.\n\nThe following example deletes row 5 and 10 of the first sheet of the active workbook.\n\nUse Columns on a worksheet to obtain a range consisting all columns on the worksheet. You can access single columns via Item(row) [sic], where row is the column index given as a number or as an A1-style column address. Item can be omitted since the call is forwarded to it by the default member of Range.\n\nThe following example deletes column \"B\", \"C\", \"E\", and \"J\" of the first sheet of the active workbook.\n\nUse_expression_.Rows, where expression is an expression that returns a Range object, to obtain a range consisting of the rows in the first area of the range. You can access single rows via Item(row), where row is the relative row index from the top of the first area of the range. Item can be omitted since the call is forwarded to it by the default member of Range.\n\nThe following example deletes the ranges C8:D8 and C6:D6 of the first sheet of the active workbook.\n\nUse_expression_.Columns, where expression is an expression that returns a Range object, to obtain a range consisting of the columns in the first area of the range. You can access single columns via Item(row) [sic], where row is the relative column index from the left of the first area of the range given as a number or as an A1-style column address. Item can be omitted since the call is forwarded to it by the default member of Range.\n\nThe following example deletes the ranges L2:L10, G2:G10, F2:F10 and D2:D10 of the first sheet of the active workbook.\n\nUse Offset (row, column), where row and column are the row and column offsets, to return a range at a specified offset to another range. The following example selects the cell three rows down from and one column to the right of the cell in the upper-left corner of the current selection. You cannot select a cell that is not on the active sheet, so you must first activate the worksheet.\n\nUse Union (range1, range2, ...) to return multiple-area ranges—that is, ranges composed of two or more contiguous blocks of cells. The following example creates an object defined as the union of ranges A1:B2 and C3:D4, and then selects the defined range.\n\nIf you work with selections that contain more than one area, the Areas property is useful. It divides a multiple-area selection into individual Range objects and then returns the objects as a collection. Use the Count property on the returned collection to verify a selection that contains more than one area, as shown in the following example.\n\nThis example uses the AdvancedFilter method of the Range object to create a list of the unique values, and the number of times those unique values occur, in the range of column A.\n\nHave questions or feedback about Office VBA or this documentation?

        "document": "To develop solutions that use Microsoft Office Excel, you can interact with the objects provided by the Excel object model. This topic introduces the most important objects:\n• Applies to: The information in this topic applies to document-level projects and VSTO Add-in projects for Excel. For more information, see Features available by Office application and project type.\n\nThe object model closely follows the user interface. The Application object represents the entire application, and each Workbook object contains a collection of objects. From there, the major abstraction that represents cells is the Range object, which enables you to work with individual cells or groups of cells.\n\nIn addition to the Excel object model, Office projects in Visual Studio provide host items and host controls that extend some objects in the Excel object model. Host items and host controls behave like the Excel objects they extend, but they also have additional functionality such as data-binding capabilities and extra events. For more information, see Automate Excel by using extended objects and Host items and host controls overview.\n\nThis topic provides a brief overview of the Excel object model. For resources where you can learn more about the entire Excel object model, see Use the Excel object model documentation.\n\nWhen you create a new VSTO Add-in project for Excel, Visual Studio automatically creates a ThisAddIn.vb or ThisAddIn.cs code file. You can access the Application object by using or .\n\nWhen you create a new document-level project for Excel, you have the option of creating a new Excel Workbook or Excel Template project. Visual Studio automatically creates the following code files in your new Excel project for both workbook and template projects.\n\nYou can use the class in your project to access , , , or from outside of the respective class. For more information, see Global access to objects in Office projects. The following example calls the PrintPreview method of regardless of whether the code is placed in one of the n classes or the class.\n\nBecause the data in an Excel document is highly structured, the object model is hierarchical and straightforward. Excel provides hundreds of objects with which you might want to interact, but you can get a good start on the object model by focusing on a small subset of the available objects. These objects include the following four:\n• Much of the work done with Excel centers around these four objects and their members.\n\nThe Excel Application object represents the Excel application itself. The Application object exposes a great deal of information about the running application, the options applied to that instance, and the current user objects open within the instance.\n\nThe Workbook object represents a single workbook within the Excel application.\n\nThe Office development tools in Visual Studio extend the Workbook object by providing the Workbook type. This type gives you access to all features of a Workbook object. For more information, see Workbook host item.\n\nThe Worksheet object is a member of the Worksheets collection. Many of the properties, methods, and events of the Worksheet are identical or similar to members provided by the Application or Workbook objects.\n\nExcel provides a Sheets collection as a property of a Workbook object. Each member of the Sheets collection is either a Worksheet or a Chart object.\n\nThe Office development tools in Visual Studio extend the Worksheet object by providing the Worksheet type. This type gives you access to all features of a Worksheet object, as well as new features such as the ability to host managed controls and handle new events. For more information, see Worksheet host item.\n\nThe Range object is the object you will use most within your Excel applications. Before you can manipulate any region within Excel, you must express it as a Range object and work with methods and properties of that range. A Range object represents a cell, a row, a column, a selection of cells that contains one or more blocks of cells, which might or might not be contiguous, or even a group of cells on multiple sheets.\n\nVisual Studio extends the Range object by providing the NamedRange and XmlMappedRange types. These types have most of the same features as a Range object, as well as new features such as the data binding capability and new events. For more information, see NamedRange control and XmlMappedRange control.\n\nFor complete information about the Excel object model, you can refer to the Excel primary interop assembly (PIA) reference and the VBA object model reference.\n\nThe Excel PIA reference documentation describes the types in the primary interop assembly for Excel. This documentation is available from the following location: Excel 2010 primary interop assembly reference.\n\nFor more information about the design of the Excel PIA, such as the differences between classes and interfaces in the PIA and how events in the PIA are implemented, see Overview of classes and interfaces in the Office primary interop assemblies.\n\nThe VBA object model reference documents the Excel object model as it is exposed to Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code. For more information, see Excel 2010 object model reference.\n\nAll of the objects and members in the VBA object model reference correspond to types and members in the Excel PIA. For example, the Worksheet object in the VBA object model reference corresponds to the Worksheet object in the Excel PIA. Although the VBA object model reference provides code examples for most properties, methods, and events, you must translate the VBA code in this reference to Visual Basic or Visual C# if you want to use them in an Excel project that you create by using Visual Studio."
