        "document": "Error handling can be a drag, but it’s essential for the stability of your app. Naturally, I’m interested in ways to streamline the error handling process to make it as stable as it can be for the app whilst also being convenient for me to write.\n\nLately, I’ve been reading a lot about new features in ES6, such as generators, and that’s led me onto promises, an alternative method of asynchronous flow control to callbacks. I decided to look into the differences in how these different methods approach error handling, their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThe main kind of errors we’re looking at here are I/O errors in asynchronous operations. These occur when an I/O operation fails to yield the expected results, sometimes due to some external problem outside of your program’s control. For example, we might be fetching data from a MySQL database, but our query contains an error:\n\nNotice that in this example we are using Node’s default style of using a callback to handle the result of the I/O. The first argument of the callback function is . This is the standard convention in Node, the one you should follow when writing your own async functions.\n\nThe first argument to callbacks should always be\n\nDevelopers new to Node sometimes forget to follow this convention which makes it very frustrating for other developers trying to work with their code, because they have no consistent point of reference to check whether the operation succeeded or not. But if the first parameter to our callback is reserved for errors then they can be checked before processing the results of each callback.\n\nIf is falsy (usually null), then the callback can carry on assuming the operation succeeded. Otherwise, it can deal with the error in an appropriate way, such as logging it along with any contextual information. It can then decide whether or not to carry on depending on the severity of the error or whether or not the resultant data is required to continue operation.\n\nLet’s implement some error handling for our query error:\n\nHere, we check if is present. If it is, we log the error and the query that triggered it then return from the function, stopping it from running any further.\n\nYou might have a collection of multiple async operations executing in parallel. How do we handle errors in any of those?\n\nOur favourite library for asynchronous flow control is async. Both and accept a collection of operations, and if any of them pass an error to its callback, async will immediately invoke your completion callback with the error:\n\nwill execute both and in parallel but if either or both fail it will invoke our completion callback with the error that occurred first.\n\nStandard callbacks are all well and good when we’re following Node’s convention, but it’s a little bit laborious to check the result of every operation, and this can quickly get messy when there are many nested callbacks each with their own error handling code.\n\nPromises are an alternative to callbacks for asynchronous control flow. They are viewed as a solution to the “pyramid of doom” indentation caused by nested callbacks, but they also have some useful error handling features.\n\nQ is a popular module to get you working with promises. In its README, Q describes the concept of promises:\n\nPromises allow us to chain operations together in a sequential manner, without the need for nesting. They also neatly encapsulate any results and errors raised within the chain. For example:\n\nCompare this to the callback-based equivalent:\n\nThe promises method is much more compact, clearer and quicker to write. If an error or exception occurs within any of the ops it is handled by the single handler. Having this single place to handle all errors means you don’t need to write error checking for each stage of the work.\n\nAdditionally, the promise chain has more robust protection against exceptions and runtime errors that could be thrown within operations. If an exception is thrown, it will be caught by your handler, or any intermediary error handlers passed to each step. In contrast, the callback method would crash the node process because it doesn’t encapsulate exceptions thrown in I/O callbacks. Catching exceptions like this allows you to gracefully handle the error in an appropriate way instead of crashing the process straight away.\n\nFurthermore, you can use Q’s long stack support to get more helpful stack traces that keep track of the call stack across asynchronous operations.\n\nOne slight disadvantage of promises is that in order to use them, you need to make any normal node callback-style code compatible with promise flow control. This usually involves passing the functions through an adapter to make it compatible with promises, such as Q’s .\n\nWe’ve spoken a lot about I/O errors during asynchronous flow control, but Node.js has another way of running handlers asynchronously: events.\n\nIn Node, an object can be made into an event emitter by inheriting the EventEmitter on its prototype. All core node modules that emit events such as or inherit from EventEmitter.\n\nWhen an event emitter encounters an error (e.g. a TCP socket abruptly disconnects), it will emit a special ‘error’ event. The ‘error’ event is special in Node because if there are no listeners on the event emitter for this event then the event emitter will throw an exception and this will crash the process.\n\nYou might be tempted to prevent exceptions being thrown by binding a listener to the ‘error’ event and logging it instead of crashing. This is potentially dangerous, because you usually can’t guarantee exactly where the error originated from and what all the consequences of it are. Usually the best thing to do is catch the error, log it, close any existing connections and gracefully restart your app.\n\nDo not use\n\nwas added to node for the purpose of catching errors and doing cleanup before the node process exits. Beware! This has quickly become an anti-pattern in Node. It loses the context of the exception, and is prone to hanging if your event handler doesn’t call .\n\nDomains were created as a more official way of capturing uncaught exceptions or stray ‘error’ events before they get to crash the process.\n\nWhile the domains API is still in unstable state and is subject to some criticism, it is still better than using . Read the docs for usage info.\n\nFurther reading on Q module and domains documentation."

        "document": "When developing applications with Node.js, error handling is one of the most crucial aspects to consider. Node.js is known for its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it highly efficient for building scalable applications. However, the asynchronous nature of Node.js can make error handling more complex. Without proper error handling, your application may crash unexpectedly, leading to a poor user experience. In this article, we will explore best practices for error handling in Node.js applications, from understanding error mechanisms to implementing strategies that keep your application robust and reliable.\n\nIf you’re looking for experienced professionals to handle your Node.js application development, hire Node.js developers who understand the importance of effective error management to ensure your application runs smoothly..\n\nNode.js follows the error-first callback pattern, which is a core principle of asynchronous programming. In this pattern, the first argument of a callback is reserved for errors. If no errors occur, the argument is or ; otherwise, it contains an error object. This allows developers to check for errors and handle them appropriately.\n\nThis simple example shows how Node.js handles errors with the error-first callback pattern. By checking for the argument, you can prevent the application from crashing and respond appropriately when something goes wrong.\n\nNode.js relies on the EventEmitter class to handle asynchronous events. Errors in events can be handled using the event. If an error is emitted and there’s no listener for the event, Node.js will terminate the process. To prevent this, always ensure you handle errors by attaching listeners to event emitters.\n\nWith the introduction of Promises and async/await in modern JavaScript, error handling has become more intuitive. Promises allow you to handle errors in asynchronous code using or blocks with async functions.\n\nIn this example, errors during the fetch request are caught by the block, ensuring that the application doesn’t crash when a network failure occurs.\n\nNode.js provides global event listeners for unhandled errors. You should handle uncaught exceptions and unhandled promise rejections at the process level to prevent your application from terminating unexpectedly.\n\nThough handling these errors is crucial for stability, it’s important to note that uncaught exceptions should still be handled with care, as ignoring them can lead to inconsistent application states.\n\nNode.js has a built-in object, but creating custom error objects can provide more context, making it easier to debug issues. By extending the object, you can add custom properties, such as error codes or additional data.\n\nThis custom error provides better insight into the cause of the problem and can be used to implement more granular error handling across your application.\n\nLogging is essential for tracking issues in production. Use structured logging to capture detailed error information, such as timestamps, stack traces, and relevant request data. Libraries like Winston and Bunyan are commonly used for logging in Node.js.\n\nAdditionally, integrating error monitoring tools like Sentry or New Relic allows you to track errors in real-time, making it easier to address critical issues before they affect users.\n\nWhile error messages are important for developers, it’s essential to present user-friendly messages to your application’s users. Avoid revealing sensitive information, such as database structure or stack traces, in production environments.\n\nInstead, show clear messages that guide the user or help them understand what to do next. For example, instead of a vague “Error occurred,” use something like “Oops! Something went wrong, please try again later.”\n\nA “fail fast” approach means that your application should detect issues as soon as they arise and provide feedback immediately. This minimizes the impact of errors and helps you maintain application stability.\n\nFor example, when validating user inputs, check for errors early and provide instant feedback, rather than letting the request proceed and failing later.\n\nDatabase-related errors are common in any Node.js application. Handling these errors often involves retries, fallbacks, or graceful degradation. Make sure to implement proper connection handling and timeout management.\n\nFor example, when connecting to a database, ensure you capture connection errors and respond appropriately:\n\nNode.js applications frequently interact with the file system. When reading or writing files, it’s important to handle errors such as permission issues or missing files.\n\nNetwork-related errors, such as connection timeouts or server unavailability, should be handled with retries or fallback mechanisms. It’s crucial to handle timeouts gracefully to maintain user experience.\n\nWhen building RESTful APIs, consistency is key. Return meaningful error codes and messages that help developers or consumers of the API understand the issue.\n\nHTTP status codes are critical for API error handling. Ensure you use the correct status code for different types of errors. For instance, use for bad requests, for not found, and for server errors.\n\nIt’s essential to test your error handling mechanisms. Use testing frameworks like Mocha and Chai to ensure that errors are correctly caught and handled.\n\nNode.js offers debugging tools such as the built-in debugger and Chrome DevTools. These tools help identify issues in both synchronous and asynchronous code.\n\nIn Node.js, robust error handling is essential to ensure that your application remains reliable and responsive, even when things go wrong. By following the best practices outlined above such as using the error-first callback pattern, custom error objects, effective logging, and proper API error responses — you can create applications that handle errors gracefully without crashing. Remember to always monitor your application in production, handle errors consistently, and fail fast to improve both stability and user experience.\n\nIf you are looking for a development partner to ensure your Node.js application has top-tier error handling practices Orbitwebtech, the best web development company, known for its expertise in building scalable and reliable web applications.\n\nFor any inquiries or further assistance, contact us today!"

Depending on your store this may be necessary, but it can also create race conditions where a client makes two parallel requests to your server and changes made to the session in one request may get overwritten when the other request ends, even if it made no changes (this behavior also depends on what store you’re using).\n\nThe default value is , but using the default has been deprecated, as the default will change in the future. Please research into this setting and choose what is appropriate to your use-case. Typically, you’ll want .\n\nHow do I know if this is necessary for my store? The best way to know is to check with your store if it implements the method. If it does, then you can safely set . If it does not implement the method and your store sets an expiration date on stored sessions, then you likely need .\n\nForce the session identifier cookie to be set on every response. The expiration is reset to the original , resetting the expiration countdown.\n\nThe default value is .\n\nWith this enabled, the session identifier cookie will expire in since the last response was sent instead of in since the session was last modified by the server.\n\nThis is typically used in conjuction with short, non-session-length values to provide a quick timeout of the session data with reduced potential of it occurring during on going server interactions.\n\nNote When this option is set to but the option is set to , the cookie will not be set on a response with an uninitialized session. This option only modifies the behavior when an existing session was loaded for the request.\n\nForces a session that is “uninitialized” to be saved to the store. A session is uninitialized when it is new but not modified. Choosing is useful for implementing login sessions, reducing server storage usage, or complying with laws that require permission before setting a cookie. Choosing will also help with race conditions where a client makes multiple parallel requests without a session.\n\nThe default value is , but using the default has been deprecated, as the default will change in the future. Please research into this setting and choose what is appropriate to your use-case.\n\nNote if you are using Session in conjunction with PassportJS, Passport will add an empty Passport object to the session for use after a user is authenticated, which will be treated as a modification to the session, causing it to be saved. This has been fixed in PassportJS 0.3.0\n\nThis is the secret used to sign the session ID cookie. The secret can be any type of value that is supported by Node.js (like a string or a ). This can be either a single secret, or an array of multiple secrets. If an array of secrets is provided, only the first element will be used to sign the session ID cookie, while all the elements will be considered when verifying the signature in requests. The secret itself should be not easily parsed by a human and would best be a random set of characters. A best practice may include:\n• The use of environment variables to store the secret, ensuring the secret itself does not exist in your repository.\n• Periodic updates of the secret, while ensuring the previous secret is in the array.\n\nUsing a secret that cannot be guessed will reduce the ability to hijack a session to only guessing the session ID (as determined by the option).\n\nChanging the secret value will invalidate all existing sessions. In order to rotate the secret without invalidating sessions, provide an array of secrets, with the new secret as first element of the array, and including previous secrets as the later elements.\n\nNote HMAC-256 is used to sign the session ID. For this reason, the secret should contain at least 32 bytes of entropy.\n\nThe session store instance, defaults to a new instance.\n\nControl the result of unsetting (through , setting to , etc.).\n\nThe default value is .\n• The session will be destroyed (deleted) when the response ends.\n• The session in the store will be kept, but modifications made during the request are ignored and not saved.\n\nTo store or access session data, simply use the request property , which is (generally) serialized as JSON by the store, so nested objects are typically fine. For example below is a user-specific view counter:\n\nTo regenerate the session simply invoke the method. Once complete, a new SID and instance will be initialized at and the will be invoked.\n\nDestroys the session and will unset the property. Once complete, the will be invoked.\n\nReloads the session data from the store and re-populates the object. Once complete, the will be invoked.\n\nSave the session back to the store, replacing the contents on the store with the contents in memory (though a store may do something else–consult the store’s documentation for exact behavior).\n\nThis method is automatically called at the end of the HTTP response if the session data has been altered (though this behavior can be altered with various options in the middleware constructor). Because of this, typically this method does not need to be called.\n\nThere are some cases where it is useful to call this method, for example, redirects, long-lived requests or in WebSockets.\n\nUpdates the property. Typically this is not necessary to call, as the session middleware does this for you.\n\nEach session has a unique ID associated with it. This property is an alias of and cannot be modified. It has been added to make the session ID accessible from the object.\n\nEach session has a unique cookie object accompany it. This allows you to alter the session cookie per visitor. For example we can set to to enable the cookie to remain for only the duration of the user-agent.\n\nAlternatively will return the time remaining in milliseconds, which we may also re-assign a new value to adjust the property appropriately. The following are essentially equivalent\n\nFor example when is set to (one minute), and 30 seconds has elapsed it will return until the current request has completed, at which time is called to reset to its original value.\n\nThe property returns the original (time-to-live), in milliseconds, of the session cookie.\n\nTo get the ID of the loaded session, access the request property . This is simply a read-only value set when a session is loaded/created.\n\nEvery session store must be an and implement specific methods. The following methods are the list of required, recommended, and optional.\n• Required methods are ones that this module will always call on the store.\n• Recommended methods are ones that this module will call on the store if available.\n• Optional methods are ones this module does not call at all, but helps present uniform stores to users.\n\nFor an example implementation view the connect-redis repo.\n\nThis optional method is used to get all sessions in the store as an array. The should be called as .\n\nThis required method is used to destroy/delete a session from the store given a session ID ( ). The should be called as once the session is destroyed.\n\nThis optional method is used to delete all sessions from the store. The should be called as once the store is cleared.\n\nThis optional method is used to get the count of all sessions in the store. The should be called as .\n\nThis required method is used to get a session from the store given a session ID ( ). The should be called as .\n\nThe argument should be a session if found, otherwise or if the session was not found (and there was no error). A special case is made when to act like .\n\nThis required method is used to upsert a session into the store given a session ID ( ) and session ( ) object. The callback should be called as once the session has been set in the store.\n\nThis recommended method is used to “touch” a given session given a session ID ( ) and session ( ) object. The should be called as once the session has been touched.\n\nThis is primarily used when the store will automatically delete idle sessions and this method is used to signal to the store the given session is active, potentially resetting the idle timer.\n\nThe following modules implement a session store that is compatible with this module.

It allows servers to maintain stateful information about clients throughout their interactions with the application. Sessions are essential for tasks such as user authentication, storing user-specific data, and managing shopping cart information.\n\nIn Node.js and Express, sessions are typically managed using the middleware. Here's a breakdown of how sessions are implemented:\n\nConfiguration: First, we configure the session middleware with options such as a secret key, resave behavior, and uninitialized session handling.\n\nSetting Session Data: When a client makes a request, Express generates a unique session identifier (usually stored in a cookie) and associates it with the client.

Session management ensures that user data, preferences, and session-related information are securely stored and managed.\n\nTo implement session management in Node.js applications, you need to use a session management middleware. A middleware is a function that sits between the client and the server, processing requests and responses.\n\nThe first step in implementing session management in Node.js applications is to install and configure the session middleware. There are several session middleware options available for Node.js, including , , and . You can install and configure these middleware options using .\n\nTo install express-session, we can run the following command:\n\n\n\nOnce installed, we can require it in our Node.js application and configure it as follows:\n\n\n\nIn the above code sample, we have initialized the express-session middleware with the following configuration options:\n• None secret: This option is used to set a secret key for the session. The secret key is used to sign the session ID cookie to prevent tampering.\n• None resave: This option determines whether the session should be saved to the store on every request. Setting this option to false can improve performance.\n• None saveUninitialized: This option determines whether to save uninitialized sessions. Setting this option to false can improve performance.\n\nOnce you have installed and configured the session middleware, the next step is to initialize it. Initialization involves creating a session object that stores user data and preferences. You can initialize the session middleware in your application's entry point, such as or .\n\n\n\nIn the above code sample, we have initialized the session middleware and accessed the session data using the object.\n\nThe session middleware stores session data in the server's memory or a separate session store, such as a Redis database. When a user logs in, the session middleware creates a session object and assigns it a unique ID. The session ID is then stored in a cookie on the user's browser. The session middleware uses the session ID to retrieve the session data from the server or session store.\n\n\n\nIn the above code sample, we have stored session data for an authenticated user using the object.\n\nTo ensure that session data is not stored indefinitely, it is essential to manage session timeouts. Session timeouts determine how long a session can remain idle before it is invalidated. You can set a timeout for a session by configuring the session middleware. When a session timeout occurs, the session middleware deletes the session data from the server or session store.\n\nWe can set the session timeout using the option when initializing the session middleware. The option is expressed in milliseconds and determines the maximum age of a session.\n\n\n\nIn the above code sample, we have set the session timeout to 60 seconds using the option.\n\nWhen a user logs out or the session expires, we need to destroy the session to ensure that session data is not stored indefinitely. We can destroy a session using the method.\n\n\n\nIn the above code sample, we have destroyed the session using the method.\n\nTo retrieve session data, we can access the object. The object is an object that contains session data.\n\n\n\nIn the above code sample, we have retrieved session data using the object.\n\nFinally, it is crucial to secure session data to prevent unauthorized access or tampering. You can secure session data by using secure cookies, encrypting session data, and implementing HTTPS encryption.\n\nSession management is a critical part of web application development. In this article, we have explored how to implement session management in Node.js applications using the express-session middleware. We have covered installing and configuring the session middleware, initializing the session middleware, storing session data, managing session timeouts, destroying sessions, and retrieving session data. By following the best practices outlined in this article, you can ensure that your Node.js applications are secure and reliable."

        "document": "To explain session management in Node.js in simpler terms, imagine you're visiting a website and logging in.\n\nThe website needs a way to remember who you are while you're browsing different pages, right? That's where sessions come in! Sessions help the website keep track of you, storing your information temporarily so it can recognize you, even after you move from one page to another.\n\nSession management is like a system that keeps track of a user's interactions with a website. Think of it as a \"memory\" for the website, helping it remember you while you're logged in. Every time you visit the site, it starts a \"session,\" and the site remembers things about you, like your name or your preferences. This session ends when you log out.\n\nTo manage sessions in a Node.js app, you need something called middleware—a helper that sits between the user and the server to process the requests. One of the most popular options for managing sessions in Node.js is express-session.\n\nHere's how you can get started:\n• Set up the session middleware in your app. This is how you do it:\n\nWhen a user logs in, a unique session is created just for them. This session data is stored on the server, while a small piece of information, called a session ID, is saved in the user's browser. Every time the user makes a request (like visiting a new page), the session ID is sent back to the server to retrieve the user's session.\n\nHere's an example of how this looks in code:\n\n\n\nIn this example, once the user logs in, the session stores their status and .\n\nSessions don’t last forever. After a while, the session should expire for security reasons. You can control how long a session lasts by setting an expiration time. Here’s how you can make a session expire after 1 minute:\n\n\n\nLogging Out and Destroying the Session\n\nWhen a user logs out, you want to destroy their session so the website no longer remembers them. Here’s how you can do that:\n\n\n\nIf you want to use the session information, like displaying the username on a dashboard, you can easily retrieve it like this:\n\n\n\nLastly, it’s important to keep session data safe. You can do this by:\n• Using secure cookies (cookies that are only sent over HTTPS).\n\nIn simple terms, sessions help websites remember who you are while you’re logged in. In a Node.js app, we use middleware like express-session to manage these sessions, store user data, set expiration times, and secure the session information. This ensures that the site is efficient and secure for users while managing their sessions."

        "document": "Why we need sessions\n\nThe classic Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a stateless tool. This means every request that is sent from a single client is interpreted by the Web server independently and is not related to any other request. There is no inbuilt mechanism for the server to remember a specific user from different multiple requests, which also makes it impossible for the server to know if each request originated from the same user.\n\nSession tracking enables you to track a user’s progress over multiple servlets or HTML pages, which, by nature, are stateless. A session is defined as a series of related browser requests that come from the same client during a certain time period. Session tracking ties together a series of browser requests — think of these requests as pages — that may have some meaning as a whole, such as a shopping cart application.\n\nThere are few types of session storing techniques"
