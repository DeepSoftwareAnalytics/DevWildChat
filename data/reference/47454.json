        "document": "Alright, so here’s an example of matrix multiplication:\n\nSome helpful shortcuts to remember when dealing with matrix multiplication. Let’s say we’re multiplying A*B, where A is a (4x2) matrix and B is a (2x3) matrix (like in the example above).\n• The number of columns of A need to match the number of rows in B. (We’re good in this case—there are 2 columns in A, and 2 rows in B.) If this isn’t true, you can’t multiply the matrices together.\n• The resulting matrix will have as many rows as A and as many columns as B. So in this case, the result will be a (4x3) matrix.\n\nMoving on—here’s an example of list comprehensions in Python:\n\nAnd we want to create something like this…\n\nSo how do we go about solving this?\n\nFirst, let’s think through how we’d solve this if there were no constraints.\n\nIf we weren’t restricted to just using built-in Python functions, and we didn’t need to use a list comprehension, the problem would be trivial—we could just use the NumPy matrix multiplication function.\n\nBut that’s obviously defeating the purpose of this puzzle.\n\nUsing a for loop and NumPy functions\n\nSo let’s say we can’t use np.matmul(), but anything else is fine. How would we approach it then?\n\nWell, matrix multiplication can be thought of as taking a row of A, a column of B, doing the dot product between them, and then storing that result in the new matrix. Specifically, if we take the 2nd row of matrix A and the 3rd column of matrix B, and then we take the dot product of those two, then we’ll store the result in position (2, 3) in the new matrix (the value at row 2 column 3).\n\nLet’s try to put this idea into code using for loops. We’ll still use NumPy for the matrix dot product for now, just so we don’t have to worry about it at first.\n\nThis works! But we’re leaning pretty heavily on NumPy functions and objects currently (like NumPy arrays and the .dot() method), so in just a minute we’re going to see if we can write a for loop without some of this NumPy functionality.\n\nUnderstanding the problem is sometimes easy, sometimes really difficult. It can often help to start with simpler versions of the problem to start with, or to break the problem down into smaller and simpler pieces. Here are some examples of that process:\n• Before trying to implement matrix multiplication, make sure you really understand how it’s computed. Try it for two 2x2 matrices, working out the math by hand. Google around for good explanations of what matrix multiplication is doing.\n• Write the simplest list comprehension you can, and then increase the complexity slowly: you could add a for loop inside the list comp; then you could add a conditional; then maybe you could try two for loops; then two loops and a conditional; etc. Build things up in complexity, trying to develop an intuitive sense of what’s going on.\n• Before using list comprehensions, use for loops.\n• Before typing anything into a computer, use pencil and paper.\n• Sketch things and try things even if you don’t feel like you understand what’s going on. Experimentation is a wonderful way to learn!\n\nNow that we basically know what we’re doing, we’re going to slowly improve our solution by getting it closer to the final product. In our case, this mostly means converting everything to use built-in Python functions and objects (rather than NumPy functions and objects). We’ll also do some code cleanup at the end.\n\nThis is where the bulk of the work actually happens\n\nFirst, let’s get rid of the NumPy dot product function. To compute the dot product of two vectors of equal length, you essentially multiply the numbers that are at the same indices of each vector and then add them all together. So let’s say you have two vectors: (a1 a2) and (b1 b2). Then the dot product would be:\n\nLet’s put this into our code.\n\nCreating the new matrix without relying on np arrays\n\nNext, let’s think about how we can create the result matrix without using NumPy arrays to store the values as certain indices.\n\nThe way our for loops are nested, we’re going to dot product a single row of A by all of our columns in B before moving onto the next row in A. This means that these dot product values will all exist in the first row of our resulting matrix.\n\nThis means that each time we take a row in A and iterate through dot products of the columns in B, we can create a new list with all of those results. That list will become a new row in our resulting matrix! After going through each row in A, we’ll create a list of lists—which will be exactly the matrix we’re looking for.\n\nIf you’re not sure how this works, step through the for loop yourself and see what’s happening.\n\nA brief interlude: what happened to the list comp?\n\nNotice that we’ve effectively forgotten about the list comprehension part of the puzzle for now.\n\nThis is totally fine! In fact, it’s necessary—before solving the problem with certain parameters, we need to figure out how to solve the problem at all.\n\nWe’re currently figuring out how to do matrix multiplication using just built-in Python functions, and this isn’t a trivial task. After figuring this out using any approach we need (in this case, a for loop), we can then move on to crafting a solution that satisfies all of the requirements—namely, using a list comprehension.\n\nCurrently, we’re converted each matrix into a NumPy array in the beginning of the function so that we can transpose matrix B using “B.T”. We’re transposing it like this so that we can iterate through the columns of B using the normal Python “for item in my_list” syntax.\n\nHow can we iterate through the columns of B using built-in Python functionality?"

        "document": "In this article, we will explore how to implement Matrices and Grids in Data Structures using Python. We’ll cover the basic concepts, how to represent data, and practical coding techniques. Whether you’re working with multi-dimensional arrays or need a structured data layout, this guide will help you understand and apply matrices and grids in Python.\n\nWhat is Matrix in Python?\n\nIn Python, a matrix is essentially a two-dimensional Numpy array, which holds data in rows and columns. The rows in a Python matrix are the horizontal sequences of items, and the columns are the vertical sequences of items. Essentially, a matrix in Python is akin to a nested list, with rows and columns stacked over each other. The size of a matrix with r rows and c columns is determined by the r x c order of the matrix object.\n\nHow do Matrices in Python work?\n\nWe write data in a two-dimensional array to create a matrix. It is done as follows:\n\nIt displays a matrix having 3 rows and 5 columns, so its dimension is 3×5. Integer data type objects make up the data in this matrix. Row1, the first row, has values (2, 3, 5, 7, 6), while Row2 has values (3, 2, 6, 7, 2) and Row3 has values 5, 7, 2, 6, 1. Regarding columns, Column1 has values (2, 3, 5), Column2 has values (3, 2, 7), and so on.\n\nThe matrix is shown with 3 rows and 3 columns, making it a 3×3 dimension. Matrices with equal rows and columns are known as square matrices.\n\nIn Python, users can store their data in an m x n dimensional matrix. Operations such as matrix addition, multiplication, transposition, and others can be performed on a matrix-like structure.\n\nCreating a matrix object in Python is not a simple process. Python matrices can be constructed using arrays and utilised in a similar manner.\n\nWe will add the two matrices and use the nested for loop through the given matrices.\n\n# Python program to add two matrices without using numpy\n\n# Creating matrices in the form of nested lists\n\n#Adding the three matrices using nested loops\n\nprint(“The sum of the matrices is = “, matrix4)\n\nThe sum of the matrices is = [[27, 46, 11], [49, 17, 21], [23, 8, 17]]\n\nThe use of matrices in Python offers both advantages and disadvantages.\n• Effective Data Representation: Matrices provide a compact and organized method of storing multi-dimensional data, simplifying the management and manipulation of large datasets.\n• Convenient Operations: Python, particularly when using libraries like NumPy, includes built-in functions for efficient matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and transposition.\n• Flexibility: Matrices can represent a diverse range of data structures, including grids, tables, and images, making them valuable in fields such as data science, machine learning, and computer graphics.\n• Memory Usage: Dealing with large matrices, particularly in the context of high-dimensional or sparse data, may lead to significant memory consumption, as many elements could be zero or empty.\n• Complex Implementation: The implementation and understanding of matrices can be intricate, especially for beginners or when working with high-dimensional matrices.\n• Performance Impact: Certain operations, particularly those involving sparse matrices, may not achieve optimal performance without the use of specialized libraries. Basic Python lists, when used as matrices, may perform slower compared to optimized data structures such as NumPy arrays.\n\nAfter looking into all of the major features, matrices act a major purpose in Python’s data structures, providing an organized and efficient technique for dealing with multidimensional data. This article has covered the principles of creating, representing, and performing operations on matrices, such as addition. The use of matrices promotes structured data storage and processing, which is particularly useful in fields such as data science, machine learning, and computer graphics.\n\nNonetheless, it matters to recognize the potential negative aspects, such as memory utilization and the complexity of implementation. .Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced developer, understanding matrices will improve your ability to solve a wide range of computational challenges."
