Each element in the returned object can be accessed by its index. The index value will start with 0.

For searching with multiple class names, it must be separated with space.\n\nNote: We can use the length property that returns the collection of all HTML elements in a document for the specified class name & then by looping through the HTML elements, we can take the information that wants.\n\nExample 1: This example describes the getElementsByClassName() method for getting access to an HTML element by its class name.\n\nExample 2: This example describes the use of the document.getElementsByClassName() method that accesses all the 3 button classes with the specific color & alters the color of the button on clicked & the last button resets all the above 3 buttons to their initial state.\n\nSupported Browser: The browsers supported by DOM getElementsByClassName() are listed below:\n\nWhat does the getElementsByClassName() method do in HTML DOM?\n\nIs the result of getElementsByClassName() live or static?\n\nWhat type of object does getElementsByClassName() return?"

The method on the interface works essentially the same way, except it acts on the entire document, starting at the document root.\n\nAs always, the returned collection is live, meaning that it always reflects the current state of the DOM tree rooted at the element on which the function was called. As new elements that match are added to the subtree, they immediately appear in the collection. Similarly, if an existing element that doesn't match has its set of classes adjusted so that it matches, it immediately appears in the collection. The opposite is also true; as elements no longer match the set of names, they are immediately removed from the collection. Note: In quirks mode, the class names are compared in a case-insensitive fashion. Otherwise, they're case sensitive.\n\nTo look for elements that include among their classes a single specified class, we just provide that class name when calling : This example finds all elements that have a class of , which are also a descendant of the element that has the of :\n\nYou can use either the method on the returned or standard array syntax to examine individual elements in the collection.

Using , you can monitor changes to a specific DOM element or section of the page and react to these changes programmatically.\n\nis designed to efficiently observe DOM mutations.

For example, if a user submits a form and the result updates the page, you can observe those changes and automatically update related elements.\n\nIn some scenarios, developers use in automated testing to ensure that certain actions result in specific DOM changes. This can be particularly helpful for end-to-end testing frameworks that require detecting DOM updates without directly interacting with the internal code."

This attribute does declare a StyleSheet that the CSSOM will parse and use if needed, but the CSSOM and the DOM are two separate things.\n\nSo what you want to detect is a CSSOM change not a DOM one (the attribute doesn't change when you resize your screen), and this, a MutationObserver can't do it.\n\nHowever, since you are willing to listen for a CSS MediaQuery change, then you can use the MediaQueryList interface and its onchange event handler:"
