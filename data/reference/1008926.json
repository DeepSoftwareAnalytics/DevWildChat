The name expansion is naive, so if you set the namespace to be “foo.”, then the resulting parameter names will be like “foo..name”. However, if the namespace is an empty string, then no leading ‘.’ will be placed before each name, which would have been the case when naively expanding “namespace.name”. This allows you to declare several parameters at once without a namespace. This method, if successful, will result in any callback registered with to be called once for each parameter.

        "document": "In this tutorial, we will create a Python publisher for ROS 2. Knowing how to write a publisher node is one of the most important skills in robotics software engineering.\n\nIn ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), a Python publisher is a script written in Python that sends messages across the ROS network to other parts of the system.\n\nOn a real robot, you will write many different publishers that publish data that gets shared by the different components of a robot: strings, LIDAR scan readings, ultrasonic sensor readings, camera frames, 3D point cloud data, integers, float values, battery voltage readings, odometry data, and much more.\n\nThe official instructions for creating a publisher are here, but I will walk you through the entire process, step by step.\n\nFollow along with me click by click, keystroke by keystroke.\n\nWe will be following the ROS 2 Python Style Guide.\n• You have completed this tutorial: How to Create a ROS 2 Package – Jazzy.\n• I am assuming you are using Visual Studio Code, but you can use any code editor.\n\nBefore we write our first publisher node, let’s understand some ROS 2 vocabulary.\n\nIn a complex robot, you are going to have many pieces of code in your system that need to communicate with each other.\n\nFor example, the code that is responsible for making navigation decisions needs to subscribe to laser scan messages from the LIDAR to be able to avoid obstacles properly.\n\nYou might have another piece of code that reads from the robot’s battery and publishes the percentage battery remaining.\n\nIn ROS 2, the parts of your system that are responsible for publishing messages to the rest of the robot – like the distance to an obstacle – are known as publisher nodes. These nodes are usually written in C++ and Python.\n\nYou have many different types of built-in messages that you can publish over ROS 2.\n\nFor example, if you want to send distance information from a LIDAR sensor, you have a special sensor message called LaserScan. You can see the definition of this message type on this link.\n\nFor battery health, you even have a special sensor message type for that called BatteryState.\n\nYou also have other sensor message types, which you can see on this list.\n\nIn a previous tutorial, we published the text message “Hello World” from a publisher node called talker. This message type is a string, which is one of the standard message types in ROS 2.\n\nOn this link, you can see we have standard message types for integers, floating-point numbers, booleans (like True and False), and many more.\n\nThe beauty of ROS 2 is that there is a message type for 95% of robotic scenarios. For the other 5%, you can create your own custom message type. I will show you how to do that in a future tutorial.\n\nThe parts of your system that subscribe to messages sent from publishers are known as subscriber nodes.\n\nSubscriber nodes are pieces of code, usually written in C++ or Python, that are responsible for receiving information.\n\nFor example, the robot’s path planning code could be a subscriber node since it subscribes to LIDAR data to plan a collision-free path from an initial location to a goal location.\n\nMessages are the data packets that the publisher nodes send out. They can include information like LIDAR scan data, camera images, ultrasonic sensor readings, numbers, text, or even complex data structures.\n\nYou can find a master list of the different types of messages by going here to the ROS 2 documentation. You even have other message types to represent things like bounding boxes for object detection.\n\nTopics are the named channels over which messages are sent out.\n\nFor example, in many real-world mobile robotics applications where you are using a LIDAR, messages about the distance to obstacles are sent on a topic named “/scan”. By convention, the name of a topic in ROS 2 has a leading forward slash before the name.\n\nTopics allow different parts of a robot or rather different nodes in a robotic system to communicate with each other by subscribing to and publishing messages on these named channels.\n\nNow that we have covered some fundamental terminology, let’s write some code.\n\nType “ros2_fundamentals_examples” to create a new folder for our Python script.\n\nPay careful attention to the name of the folder where we will house our Python scripts. The name of this folder must have the same name as the package.\n\nRight-click on the ros2_fundamentals_examples folder to create a new publisher file called “py_minimal_publisher.py”.\n\nI added detailed comments to the code so you can understand what each piece is doing.\n\nTo generate the comments for each class and function, you follow these steps for the autoDocstring package.\n\nYour cursor must be on the line directly below the definition of the function or class to generate all the comments.\n\nThen press enter after opening docstring with triple quotes (“””).\n\nWhat we are going to do in this node is publish the string “Hello World” to a topic named /py_example_topic. The string message will also contain a counter that keeps track of how many times the message has been published.\n\nWe chose the name /py_example_topic for the topic, but you could have chosen any name.\n\nNow, we need to configure our package so that ROS 2 can discover this Python node we just created. To do that, we need to create a special initialization file.\n\nRight-click on the name of the ros2_ws/src/ros2_fundamentals_examples/ros2_fundamentals_examples folder, and create an empty script called\n\nHere is what the file should look like:\n\nThe presence of _ _init_ _.py explicitly designates a directory as a Python package. This enables Python’s import machinery to recognize and treat it as a cohesive collection of Python code.\n\nNow let’s create a README.md file. A README.md file is a plain text file that serves as an introduction and explanation for a project, software, or package. It’s like a welcome mat for anyone encountering your work, providing essential information and guidance to get them started.\n\nRight-click on the package (…/src/ros2_fundamentals_examples/), and create a new file named README.md.\n\nYou can find a syntax guide on how to write a README.md file here on GitHub.\n\nTo see what the README.md file looks like, you can right-click on README.md on the left pane and click “Open Preview”.\n\nNow let’s open the package.xml file. Make sure it looks like this.\n\nThe package.xml file is an important part of any ROS 2 package. Think of package.xml as your ROS 2 package’s identification card. Just like how your ID card contains essential information about you – your name, date of birth, ID number, and address – package.xml holds key details about your package.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the key elements you’ll find in a typical package.xml file. You don’t need to memorize this. Just come back to this tutorial if you are ever in doubt:\n• name: The unique identifier for the package, often corresponding to the folder name.\n• description: A brief explanation of the package’s purpose and functionality.\n• maintainer: Who is maintaining the package.\n• license: Specifies the license under which the package is distributed, indicating how others are permitted to use, modify, and redistribute the package’s code and other assets.\n• buildtool_depend: Build tools (like compilers) needed for building the package.\n• depend: Package dependencies that are required for building the package. Since we are publishing a message of type std_msgs/String, we need to make sure we declare a dependency on the std_msgs ROS 2 package.\n• test_depend: Tools used for checking the code for bugs and errors.\n• export: Defines properties and settings used during package installation.\n\nNow let’s configure the CMakeLists.txt file. A CMakeLists.txt file in ROS 2 defines how a ROS 2 package should be built. It contains instructions for building and linking the package’s executables, libraries, and other files.\n\nI have commented out sections which we are going to use in the future:\n\nThe standard sections of a CMakeLists.txt file for ROS 2 are as follows:\n\nSpecifies the minimum required version of CMake for building the package. This is typically set to a version that is known to be compatible with ROS 2.\n\nSpecifies the name of the ROS 2 package.\n\nFinds and loads the necessary dependencies for the ROS 2 package.\n\nLists all the packages and libraries needed by the project.\n\nTells the compiler where to find header files for C++ code. We aren’t going to use this line yet because our publisher is written in Python.\n\nCreates an executable program using the specified source file. We will add this publisher in the next tutorial.\n\nLinks the program with the required dependencies.\n\nCopies folders to the project’s install directory for sharing.\n\n11. install(TARGETS <program names go here separated by space> DESTINATION lib/${PROJECT_NAME}):\n\nInstalls the built C++ programs to the project’s install directory. We will write these C++ programs later.\n\nSets up code checking (linting) if testing is enabled.\n\nAllows other packages to use this package’s header files.\n\nGenerates necessary files for other packages to find and use this package.\n\nNow that we have created our script and configured our build files, we need to build everything into executables so that we can run our code.\n\nIf this command doesn’t work, type these commands:\n• <package_name>: Replace this with the name of your ROS 2 package containing the Python script.\n• <python_script_name>.py: Replace this with the name of your Python script file that contains the ROS 2 node.\n\nNote that, you can use the tab button to autocomplete a partial command. For example, type the following and then press the TAB button on your keyboard.\n\nAfter autocompletion, the command looks like this:\n\nHere is what the output looks like:\n\nLet’s see a list of all currently active topics.\n\nWe see we have three active topics:\n\n/parameter_events and /rosout topics appear even when no nodes are actively running due to the presence of system-level components and the underlying architecture of the ROS 2 middleware.\n\nThe /parameter_events topic facilitates communication about parameter changes, and the /rosout topic provides a centralized way to access log messages generated by different nodes within the ROS 2 network. You can ignore both topics.\n\n/py_example_topic is the topic we created with our Python node. Let’s see what data is being published to this topic.\n\nYou can see the string message that is being published to this topic, including the counter integer we created in the Python script.\n\nPress CTRL + C in the terminal to stop the output.\n\nAt what frequency is data being published to this topic?\n\nData is being published at 2Hz, or every 0.5 seconds.\n\nPress CTRL + C in the terminal to stop the output.\n\nWhat type of data is being published to this topic, and how many nodes are publishing to this topic?\n\nTo get more detailed information about the topic, you could have typed:\n\nYou can see a list of the ROS 2 topic commands at this page here.\n\nWhat are the currently active nodes?\n\nLet’s find out some more information about our node.\n\nCheck out how all the nodes are communicating using this command:\n\nNow go back to the terminal where your py_minimal_publisher.py script is running and press CTRL + C to stop its execution.\n\nCongratulations! You have written your first publisher in ROS 2.\n\nIn this example, you have written a publisher to publish a basic string message. And although it is not the most exciting node, it is similar to the kinds of nodes you will write again and again over the course of your robotics career.\n\nOn a real robot, you will write many different publishers that publish data that gets shared by the different components of a robot: strings, LIDAR scan readings, ultrasonic sensor readings, camera frames, 3D point cloud data, integers, float values, battery voltage readings, odometry data, and much more.\n\nThe code you wrote in this tutorial serves as a template for creating these more complex publishers. All publishers in ROS 2 are based on the same basic framework as the node you just wrote, py_minimal_publisher.py."

The same set of common components are used to define the types of data being published and received by the simulator.\n\nFor the ROS bridge, Isaac Sim runs a custom build of ROS Noetic internally so that it works properly with the Omniverse framework and Python 3.\n\nFor the ROS 2 bridge, Isaac Sim is compatible with ROS 2 Foxy and ROS 2 Humble.\n\nROS 2 Foxy is no longer tested or supported. This may result in potential issues when ROS 2 Foxy is used in conjunction with Isaac Sim 4.2 or later. The method of ROS 2 installation determines the features of ROS 2 that can be used.

Return to the next step in the setup guide to learn how to enable the ROS Bridge.\n\nIf you do not have ROS installed on the system, the internal ROS libraries that are part of Isaac Sim can be enabled. The simplest way to enable the ROS 2 internal libraries is by configuring the options presented in the Isaac Sim App Selector when launching Isaac Sim from the Omniverse Launcher. However, to enable the internal ROS 2 libraries from the terminal follow the instructions below: If you don’t have a system level ROS 2 install, Isaac Sim comes with its own set of minimal ROS 2 libraries to fallback on. To use the Humble ROS 2 libraries, you must set the following environment variables in a new terminal or command prompt before running Isaac Sim. If Isaac Sim is installed in a non-default location replace environment variable with the Package Path shown in the Isaac Sim App Selector (see “Open in File Browser” and “Open In Terminal” buttons). /.local/share/ov/pkg/isaac-sim-4.2.0 rmw_fastrtps_cpp # Can only be set once per terminal. # Setting this command multiple times will append the internal library path again potentially leading to conflicts : /exts/omni.isaac.ros2_bridge/humble/lib /isaac-sim.sh \\AppData\\Local\\ov\\pkg\\isaac-sim-4.2.0 rmw_fastrtps_cpp REM Can only be set once per terminal.

To use the Foxy ROS 2 libraries, you must set the following environment variables in a terminal before running Isaac Sim. If Isaac Sim is installed in a non-default location replace environment variable with the Package Path shown in the Isaac Sim App Selector (see “Open in File Browser” and “Open In Terminal” buttons). Foxy is only supported on Linux. ROS 2 Foxy is no longer tested or supported. This may result in potential issues when ROS 2 Foxy is used in conjunction with Isaac Sim 4.2 or later. /.local/share/ov/pkg/isaac-sim-4.2.0 foxy rmw_fastrtps_cpp # Can only be set once per terminal. # Setting this command multiple times will append the internal library path again potentially leading to conflicts : /exts/omni.isaac.ros2_bridge/foxy/lib /isaac-sim.sh If you don’t have a system level ROS install, Isaac Sim comes with its own set of minimal ROS Noetic libraries to fallback on. Only supported in Linux. Return to the next step in the setup guide to learn how to enable the ROS Bridge.\n\nIf you intend to use a ROS 2 bridge, before launching Isaac Sim, you need to set the Fast DDS middleware on all terminals that will be passing ROS 2 messages:\n• None If you are using a Isaac Sim ROS 2 workspace, a file is located at the root of the <ros2_ws> folder. Set the environment variable by typing in all the terminals that will use ROS 2 functions.

You must also set it under “Extra Args” when launching Isaac Sim from the Nucleus Launcher.\n• None (Optional) Run before launching Isaac Sim. You can later to decide whether to use this ROS_DOMAIN_ID inside your environment, or explicitly use a different id number for any given topic.\n• None Source your ROS 2 installation and workspace before launching Isaac Sim. To enable ROS 2 bridge extensions, go to the extension manager menu Window->Extensions and search for ROS 2 bridge. Only one of the ROS Bridge extensions can be enabled at any given time. If you are switching between the two bridges, disable one before enabling the other. You must source ROS 2 in the terminal before running Isaac Sim, standalone Python scripts, or Isaac Cortex. Isaac Sim uses the libraries from your ROS 2 installation with its ROS 2 bridge. The ROS 2 bridge dynamically handles the version of ROS 2 that must be loaded (Humble or Foxy) from your sourced ROS 2 installation. If you do not source your ROS 2 installation and enable the ROS 2 bridge, Isaac Sim loads the Humble version of the bridge (a set of pre-packaged libraries with ROS 2 Humble are used as the fallback). To enable ROS bridge extensions, go to the extension manager menu Window->Extensions and search for ROS Bridge. Only one of the ROS Bridge extensions can be enabled at any given time. If switching between the two bridges, disable one before enabling the other. Return to the next step in the setup guide to learn how to setup ROS workspaces. The ROS 2 Bridge is enabled by default. If you are running and would like to disable both ROS bridges, or switch to an automatically loading ROS Bridge, use the following steps:\n• None Open the file located at . Replace with the Package Path shown in the app selector (above “Open in File Browser” and “Open In Terminal” buttons).\n• None Find the line and change it to to disable both bridges, or to automatically load ROS Bridge. Return to the next step in the setup guide to learn how to setup ROS workspaces.\n\nTo build the Isaac Sim ROS workspaces, ensure you have a system install of ROS. You are also able to build the workspaces using a ROS docker container. A few ROS packages are needed to go through the Isaac Sim ROS and ROS 2 tutorial series. To simplify it, entire ROS and ROS 2 workspaces with the necessary packages are included.

        "document": "Isaac Sim RTX or Raytraced Lidar supports both Solid State and Rotating Lidar configuration via a JSON config file. Each RTX Sensor must be attached to its own viewport to simulate properly.\n• None First we need to add a Lidar sensor to the robot. Go to Create -> Isaac -> Sensors -> RTX Lidar -> Rotating.\n• None To place the synthetic Lidar sensor at the same place as the robot’s Lidar unit, drag the Lidar prim under /World/turtlebot3_burger/base_scan. Zero out any displacement in the Transform fields inside the Property tab. The Lidar prim should now be overlapping with the scanning unit of the robot.\n• None Next we connect the ROS2 bridge with the sensor output via Omnigraph Nodes. Open visual scripting editor by going to Window -> Visual Scripting -> Action Graph. Add the following nodes to this graph:\n• None : This is the node responsible for triggering all the other nodes once is pressed.\n• None : ROS2 uses DDS for its middleware communication. DDS uses Domain ID to allow for different logical networks operate independently even though they share a physical network. ROS 2 nodes on the same domain can freely discover and send messages to each other, while ROS 2 nodes on different domains cannot. ROS2 context node creates a context with a given Domain ID. It is set to 0 by default. If is checked, it will import the from the environment in which you launched the current instance of Isaac Sim.\n• None : This is the node to running the create render product pipeline once at the start to improve performance.\n• None : In the input camera target prim select the RTX Lidar created in step 2.\n• None : This node will handle publishing of the laser scan message from the RTX Lidar. The input render product is obtained from the output of Isaac Create Render Product in step b.\n• None If you wish to also publish point cloud data, add another node, and under input type select and change the topic name to . This node will handle publishing the point cloud from the RTX Lidar. The input render product is obtained from the output of Isaac Create Render Product in step b. When is set to in the node, the LaserScan message will only be published when the RTX Lidar generates a full scan. For a rotary Lidar this is a full 360-degree rotation, while for a solid state Lidar this is the full azimuth of the Lidar, as configured in its profile. Depending on Lidar rotation rate and time step size, it may take multiple frames to complete the full rotary scan; eg. for render step size 1/60s, a rotary Lidar with rotation rate 10Hz would take 6 frames to complete a full scan, meaning the LaserScan message would be published once every 6 frames. Solid state Lidars complete the full scan in a single frame, so the corresponding LaserScan message would be published every frame. PointCloud messages are published either every frame or once the full scan has been accumulated, based on the value of the setting in the node. Once the graph has been set correctly, hit to begin simulation. The RTX Lidar should be sending the LaserScan and PointCloud2 messages and can be visualized in RViZ.\n• None The fixed frame name in Isaac Sim for the RTX Lidar is set to , update the Rviz side accordingly. We provide a menu shortcut to build multiple Lidar sensor graphs with just a few clicks. Go to . (If you don’t see any ROS2 graphs listed, you need to first enable the ROS2 bridge). A popup will appear asking for the parameters needed to populate the graphs. You must provide the Graph Path, the Lidar Prim, frameId, any Node Namespaces if you have one, and check the boxes for the data you wish to publish. If you wish to add the graphs to an existing graph, check the “Add to an existing graph?” box. This will append the nodes to the existing graph, and use the existing tick node, context node, and simulation time node if they exist.\n\nWhile most of the sample code is fairly generic, there are a few specific pieces needed to create and simulate the sensor. We first need to create the RTX Lidar Sensor Here defines the configuration for the Lidar sensor. Two generic configuration files (in addition to manufacturer/model-specific configurations) provided in : and . To switch the Lidar to the example solid state configuration you can replace , with . Next, we need create a render product and attach this sensor to it We can then create the post process pipeline that takes the rendered RTX Lidar data and publishes it to ROS: You can specify an optional attributes={…} dictionary when calling activate_node_template to set node specific parameters. See the API Documentation for complete usage information.\n\nThis tutorial covered creating and using the RTX Lidar Sensor with ROS2: Continue on to the next tutorial in our ROS2 Tutorials series, ROS2 Transform Trees and Odometry, to learn how to add global and relative transforms to a TF tree. Explore the inner workings of RTX Lidar sensors by learning How They work, the RTX Lidar Nodes that use them, and how to get RTX Lidar Synthetic Data."
