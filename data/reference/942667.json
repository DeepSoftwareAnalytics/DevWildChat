        "document": "This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange. Use the New-MailboxExportRequest cmdlet to begin the process of exporting contents of a primary mailbox or archive to a .pst file. This cmdlet is available only in the Mailbox Import Export role, and by default, the role isn't assigned to any role groups. To use this cmdlet, you need to add the Mailbox Import Export role to a role group (for example, to the Organization Management role group). For more information, see Add a role to a role group. For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see Exchange cmdlet syntax.\n\nYou can create more than one mailbox export request per mailbox, and each mailbox export request must have a unique name. Microsoft Exchange automatically generates up to 10 unique names for a mailbox export request. However, to create more than 10 export requests for a mailbox, you need to specify a unique name when creating the export request. You can remove existing export requests with the Remove-MailboxExportRequest cmdlet before starting a new request with the default request name (where X = 0-9). You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet. You need to grant the following permission to the group Exchange Trusted Subsystem to the network share where you want to export or import PST files:\n• To import PST files from the share: Read permission\n• To save exported PST files to the share: Read/Write permission. If you don't grant this permission, you will receive an error message stating that Exchange is unable to establish a connection to the PST file on the network share.\n\nThe AcceptLargeDataLoss switch specifies the request should continue even if a large number of items in the source mailbox can't be copied to the target mailbox. You don't need to specify a value with this switch. In Exchange 2013 or later, you need to use this switch if you set the LargeItemLimit parameter to a value of 51 or higher. Otherwise, the command will fail. In Exchange 2010, you need to use this switch if you set the BadItemLimit parameter to a value of 51 or higher. Otherwise, the command will fail.\n\nThe BadItemLimit parameter specifies the maximum number of bad items that are allowed before the request fails. A bad item is a corrupt item in the source mailbox that can't be copied to the target mailbox. Also included in the bad item limit are missing items. Missing items are items in the source mailbox that can't be found in the target mailbox when the request is ready to complete. Valid input for this parameter is an integer or the value unlimited. The default value is 0, which means the request will fail if any bad items are detected. If you are OK with leaving a few bad items behind, you can set this parameter to a reasonable value (we recommend 10 or lower) so the request can proceed. If too many bad items are detected, consider using the New-MailboxRepairRequest cmdlet to attempt to fix corrupted items in the source mailbox, and try the request again. In Exchange 2010, if you set this value to 51 or higher, you also need to use the AcceptLargeDataLoss switch. Otherwise, the command will fail.\n\nImportant: You can't use this parameter to export between two dates. If you try, you'll get system convert errors. You can export from a specific date, or export to a specific date, but not both. The ContentFilter parameter uses OPATH filter syntax to filter the results by the specified properties and values. Only contents that match the ContentFilter parameter will be exported into the .pst file. The search criteria uses the syntax .\n• Enclose the whole OPATH filter in double quotation marks \" \". If the filter contains system values (for example, , , or ), use single quotation marks ' ' instead. Although this parameter is a string (not a system block), you can also use braces { }, but only if the filter doesn't contain variables.\n• Property is a filterable property. For filterable properties, see Filterable properties for the ContentFilter parameter.\n• ComparisonOperator is an OPATH comparison operator (for example for equals and for string comparison). For more information about comparison operators, see about_Comparison_Operators.\n• Value is the property value to search for. Enclose text values and variables in single quotation marks ( or ). If a variable value contains single quotation marks, you need to identify (escape) the single quotation marks to expand the variable correctly. For example, instead of , use . Don't enclose integers or system values in quotation marks (for example, use , , , or instead). You can chain multiple search criteria together using the logical operators and . For example, or . For detailed information about OPATH filters in Exchange, see Additional OPATH syntax information.\n\nThe ExcludeFolders parameter specifies the list of folders to exclude during the export. Folder names aren't case-sensitive, and there are no character restrictions. Use the following syntax: : Use this syntax to denote a personal folder under the folder specified in the SourceRootFolder parameter, for example, \"MyProjects\" or \"MyProjects/FY2010\". : Use this syntax to denote a well-known folder regardless of the folder's name in another language. For example, #Inbox# denotes the Inbox folder even if the Inbox is localized in Turkish, which is Gelen Kutusu. Well-known folders include the following types: If the user creates a personal folder with the same name as a well-known folder and the # symbol surrounding it, you can use a backslash (\\) as an escape character to specify that folder. For example, if a user creates a folder named #Notes# and you want to specify that folder instead of the well-known Notes folder, use the following syntax: . Wildcard characters can't be used in folder names. To exclude the Recoverable Items folder, you must use the ExcludeDumpster parameter.\n\nThe IncludeFolders parameter specifies the list of folders to include during the export. Folder names aren't case-sensitive, and there are no character restrictions. Use the following syntax: : Use this syntax to denote a personal folder under the folder specified in the SourceRootFolder parameter, for example, \"MyProjects\" or \"MyProjects/FY2010\". : Use this syntax to denote a well-known folder regardless of the folder's name in another language. For example, #Inbox# denotes the Inbox folder even if the Inbox is localized in Turkish, which is Gelen Kutusu. Well-known folders include the following types: If the user creates a personal folder with the same name as a well-known folder and the # symbol surrounding it, you can use a backslash (\\) as an escape character to specify that folder. For example, if a user creates a folder named #Notes# and you want to specify that folder instead of the well-known Notes folder, use the following syntax: . Wildcard characters can't be used in folder names. The Recoverable Items folder is always included if you don't use the ExcludeDumpster parameter, regardless of the list of folders you provide.\n\nThe LargeItemLimit parameter specifies the maximum number of large items that are allowed before the request fails. A large item is a message in the source mailbox that exceeds the maximum message size that's allowed in the target mailbox. If the target mailbox doesn't have a specifically configured maximum message size value, the organization-wide value is used. For more information about maximum message size values, see the following topics: Valid input for this parameter is an integer or the value unlimited. The default value is 0, which means the request will fail if any large items are detected. If you are OK with leaving a few large items behind, you can set this parameter to a reasonable value (we recommend 10 or lower) so the request can proceed. If you set this value to 51 or higher, you also need to use the AcceptLargeDataLoss switch. Otherwise, the command will fail."

Click Browse to add or remove notification recipients.\n• None Clear the Send email to the mailbox below when the .pst file has been exported check box.\n\nUse the Exchange Management Shell to create a mailbox export request\n\nTo create a mailbox export request, use this syntax:\n\nThis example creates a new mailbox export request with these settings:\n• None Mailbox export request name: The default value is used, because we aren't using the Name parameter. The unique identity of the mailbox export request is (X is either not present, or has the value 0 to 9).\n• None Content and folders: Content in all folder paths in the source mailbox is replicated in the target .pst file.\n• None Priority: , because we aren't using the Priority parameter.\n\nThis example creates a new mailbox export request with these settings:\n• None Mailbox export request name: The custom name Kathleen Reiter Export is specified by the Name parameter. Specifying a custom name allows more than 10 mailbox export requests for the mailbox. The unique identity value of the mailbox export request is (for example, ).\n• None Source mailbox: The archive mailbox for Kathleen Reiter (Kathleen's primary mailbox alias is kreiter).\n• None Content and folders: Only content in the Inbox folder of the mailbox is exported (regardless of the localized name of the folder).\n\nFor detailed syntax and parameter information, see New-MailboxExportRequest.\n\nHow do you know this worked?\n\nTo verify that you've successfully created a mailbox export request, do any of these steps:\n• None In the EAC, click the notification viewer to view the status of the request.\n• None If you created the mailbox export request in the EAC, and selected the option to send notification email messages, check the notification messages. The sender is Microsoft Exchange. The first message has the subject Your Export PST request has been received . If the export request completed successfully, you'll receive another message with the subject .\n• None Replace <MailboxIdentity> with the name, email address, or alias of the source mailbox, and run this command in the Exchange Management Shell to verify the basic property values:\n• None Replace <MailboxIdentity> and <MailboxExportRequestName> with the appropriate values, and run this command in the Exchange Management Shell to verify the details:\n\nUse the Exchange Management Shell to view mailbox export requests\n\nBy default, the Get-MailboxExportRequest cmdlet returns the name, source mailbox, and status of mailbox export requests. If you pipeline the command to the Format-List cmdlet, you'll only get a limited number of additional useful details:\n• None RequestGUID: The unique GUID value of the mailbox export request.\n• None RequestQueue: The mailbox database that the export request is being run on.\n• None BatchName: The optional batch name for the mailbox export request.\n• None Identity: The unique identity value of the mailbox export request (<MailboxIdentity>\\ <MailboxExportRequestName>).\n\nBy default, the Get-MailboxExportRequestStatistics cmdlet returns the name, status, alias of the source mailbox, and the completion percentage of mailbox export requests.

You can't modify the fundamental settings of an existing request (for example, the source mailbox, target .pst file, the source content in the mailbox, or the destination in the target .pst file).\n\nTo modify a mailbox export request, use this syntax:\n\nThis example modifies the failed mailbox export request for the mailbox of Valeria Barrios to accept up to five corrupted mailbox items.\n\nFor detailed syntax and parameter information, see Set-MailboxExportRequest.\n\nNote: After you modify a suspended or failed mailbox export request, you need to resume it by using the Resume-MailboxExportRequest cmdlet.\n\nHow do you know this worked?\n\nTo verify that you've successfully modified a mailbox export request, replace <MailboxIdentity> and <MailboxExportRequestName> with the appropriate values, and run this command in the Exchange Management Shell to verify the details:\n\nYou can suspend mailbox export requests that are in progress. You can't suspend completed or failed mailbox export requests.\n\nTo suspend a mailbox export request, use this syntax:\n\nThis example suspends the mailbox export request from Kathleen Reiter's mailbox that's named Kathleen Reiter Export.\n\nThis example suspends all in-progress mailbox export requests with the comment \"OK to resume after 10 P.M. on Monday 6/19\"\n\nFor detailed syntax and parameter information, see Suspend-MailboxExportRequest.\n• None You can also use the New-MailboxExportRequest cmdlet with the Suspend switch to create a suspended mailbox export request.\n• None You use the Resume-MailboxExportRequest parameter to resume suspended mailbox export requests.\n\nHow do you know this worked?\n\nTo verify that you've successfully suspended a mailbox export request, do any of these steps:\n• None Replace <MailboxIdentity> with the name, email address, or alias of the source mailbox, run this command in the Exchange Management Shell, and verify that the Status property has the value :\n• None Run this command in the Exchange Management Shell, and verify that the suspended mailbox export request is listed:\n\nUse the Exchange Management Shell to resume mailbox export requests\n\nYou can resume suspended or failed mailbox export requests.\n\nTo resume a mailbox export request, use this syntax:\n\nThis example resumes the failed mailbox export request for Valeria Barrios' mailbox.\n\nThis example resumes all suspended mailbox export requests.\n\nFor detailed syntax and parameter information, see Resume-MailboxExportRequest.\n\nHow do you know this worked?\n\nTo verify that you've successfully resumed a mailbox export request, replace <MailboxIdentity> with the name, email address, or alias of the source mailbox, run this command in the Exchange Management Shell, and verify that the Status property doesn't have the value :\n\nUse the Exchange Management Shell to remove mailbox export requests\n\nYou can remove fully or partially completed mailbox export requests.\n• None If you remove a partially completed mailbox export request, the request is removed from the MRS job queue. Any content that's already been exported from the source mailbox isn't removed from the target .pst file.\n• None By default, completed mailbox export request are removed after 30 days (you can override this value with the CompletedRequestAgeLimit parameter), and failed requests aren't automatically removed. But, if you use the RequestExpiryInterval parameter when you create or modify a mailbox export request, these results are available:\n• None RequestExpiryInterval with a timespan value: Completed and failed requests are automatically removed after the specified timespan.\n• None RequestExpiryInterval with the value unlimited: Completed and failed requests aren't automatically removed.\n\nThis example removes the mailbox export request named MailboxExport for Akia Al-Zuhairi's mailbox.\n\nThis example removes all completed mailbox export requests.\n\nFor detailed syntax and parameter information, see Remove-MailboxExportRequest.\n\nHow do you know this worked?\n\nTo verify that you've successfully removed a mailbox export request, replace <MailboxIdentity> with the name, email address, or alias of the source mailbox, run this command in the Exchange Management Shell, and verify that the mailbox export request isn't listed:"

        "document": "Exchange Server administrators, sometimes, need to export mailboxes from Exchange Server to PST files. Some common reasons include archiving old/unwanted mailboxes, taking backup of mailbox of an employee leaving the organization, and others. To export mailboxes to PST, Exchange Server (2010 SP1 onwards) provides the New-MailboxExportRequest PowerShell command. This cmdlet is used with various parameters and switches to export some specific emails from the mailbox to PST. In this article, we will see how to use the New-MailboxExportRequest PowerShell command to export Exchange mailboxes to PST files.\n\nTo use the New-MailboxExportRequest cmdlet, the user account that you will be using must be assigned with the Mailbox Import Export role. This role is not assigned to any user (role group) by default. You can use the Exchange Admin Center (EAC) to assign the required roles and permissions. Follow the given steps:\n• Open the Exchange Admin Center (EAC). After login, click on Permissions and then admin roles.\n• Enter the name for the group.\n• Click the Add (+) button, under the Roles.\n• Find Mailbox Import Export and double-click on it to add it to the list. Click OK.\n• Add the user account to be used to export data in the Members area and click Save.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the following PowerShell cmdlet in the Exchange Management Shell (EMS) to assign the Mailbox Import Export role.\n\nYou can also assign the newly created role to the user or group by using the below command.\n\nNow, you have to create a share folder where you want to export the PST files and give the right permissions (read and write) on it. After creating the folder, you need to share this folder with the users that have the Import/Export role. You also need to add the Exchange Trusted Sub System to the permissions. These users must have full permissions on the folder.\n\nUsing the New-MailboxExportRequest Cmdlet in Exchange Server\n\nLet us see how to use the New-MailboxExportRequest cmdlet.\n\nTo export a single mailbox to PST, you can use the cmdlet as given below:\n\nIn the above command, “Anubhuti” is the mailbox name and \\\\SERVER01\\PSTFiles\\Anubhuti.pst is the file path where the PST will be exported. Depending on the size of mailbox, it may take some time to finish.\n\nYou can also export multiple mailboxes at once. For this, you can run the cmdlet with a ForEach loop (see the below example):\n\nThis command will export all the mailboxes in your organization to PST files.\n\nYou can see the progress of the export by using the Get-MailboxExportRequest cmdlet. It will show the status of export as Completed, Failed, or In-Progress.\n\nMoreover, you can use various parameters or switches with the New-MailboxExportRequest cmdlet to filter or export specific folders/items from the mailboxes. Here are some parameters or switches that you can use with this cmdlet.\n\nTo export specific folder(s) from the mailbox, you can use the IncludeFolders switch with the cmdlet (see the below example).\n\nTo exclude some particular folders while exporting the mailbox, you can use the ExcludeFolders switch (see the below command).\n\nBy using the ContentFilter parameter, you can export mailbox items to PST based on a specific date or a date range.\n\nTo export items till a particular date, you can use the command as given below:\n\nThe above command will export all the mailbox items till 1st January 2018.\n\nTo export items from a date onwards, you can use the gt switch with the cmdlet (see the below example).\n\nTo export mailbox data for a date range, you can combine the gt and lt switches (see the below example).\n\nAbove, we have explained how to use the New-MailboxExportRequest cmdlet to export mailboxes to PST in Exchange Server. However, it has some limitations, such as mailbox database must be online/mounted, export must be done one-by-one, running script to export all the mailboxes hinders the server performance, and no option to see the export progress.\n\nTo overcome such limitations, you can use Stellar Converter for EDB - an ideal tool to export mailboxes from Exchange database (EDB) file to PST format. It can open any type of EDB file (online/offline) and from any version of Exchange Server - from Exchange 2007 till Exchange 2019. It can export user mailboxes, archives, public folders, and other EDB file items. It can also directly export the mailboxes and other data to a live Exchange Server or Microsoft 365 tenant. The tool also shows real-time progress of the export."

        "document": "In some cases, you may need to export certain Microsoft Exchange mailboxes to PST files for backup or export purposes. In this guide, we will explain how to perform bulk exports of user mailboxes in Microsoft Exchange.\n\n\n\nBefore exporting or backing up data from a user mailbox, you need to do the following.\n• Gain necessary Exchange permissions. Exchange server by default does not allow you to export mailboxes. It is even prohibited for Exchange Organization Administrators members.\n• Prepare a storage folder for data export. It is better to use a network file path - we will discuss it below.\n\nYou can gain the necessary rights by running the following command in Exchange Management Shell with the account having security groups management rights:\n\nChange DOMAIN\\USER to the account from which you will perform the export.\n\nCreate a network share for the folder you will use as a PST storage. Since a mailbox export can perform on the Exchange server with a Client Access Server (CAS) role, it is necessary to ensure access to the selected folder. A network share is a good option if you use a few CAS servers or prefer to store mailbox data somewhere outside. Assign “Write” permissions to the network share for the user or group with “Mailbox Import Export\" rights.\n\nHow to Export Exchange Mailbox to PST with PowerShell Script\n\nMS Exchange has the command New-MailboxExportRequest, which you can use in Exchange Management Shell:\n\n New-MailboxExportRequest -Mailbox user_name -FilePath \"\\\\server_name\\ShareName\\Filename.pst\" Replace user_name with target user account name, and paste the network share URI next to the FilePath option. You can also use the following options for better exporting customization:\n\n \n\n - Name used to name the particular request if you want to execute a few requests per single mailbox. It will just simplify the status check.\n\n - ExcludeFolders and -IncludeFolders allows managing whether Exchange will export certain mailbox folders or not. Read the full list of parameters on the command info page.\n\n Note: if you get the “commandlet not found” error after entering the above command, you need to launch Exchange Management Shell using elevated privileges. Just right-click the Exchange Management Shell icon and choose Run as administrator. \n\n The Exchange will queue the export request and execute it as soon as possible. If the target mailbox is big or you need to export a few mailboxes - check the exporting status using this command:\n\n Get-MailboxExportRequestStatistics After the export has completed, you will see the desired PST file by the network path specified. If you need to export a few mailboxes at once, then you can create a simple script:\n\n \n\n First, let’s create a PowerShell variable to store the list of usernames:\n\n \n\n $userMailboxes = \"user1\", \"user2, \"userN\" \n\n Use the variable from the previous step as a script parameter:\n\n \n\n foreach ($User in ($$userMailboxes)) { New-MailboxExportRequest -Mailbox $User -FilePath \"\\\\localhost\\MailboxExports\\$($User).pst\" } For each $User means every entry in the $userMailboxes. $mailboxusers with the variable you created ($User means every entry in the variable). Then replace the target file path before the “$($User).pst” part - it helps to name every single PST file with a user account name. You can run the script using Windows Task Scheduler to create mailbox-level backups regularly. But keep in mind that mailbox export is a time-consuming task which puts an additional load on the Exchange server with a CAS role.\n\nIn most cases, export Exchange mailbox to PST is not a good way to back up Exchange data because it is slow, complex, and places heavy loads on Exchange servers. That said, it is a good solution if you want simply to make a few copies of a mailbox and move them outside, or if you need to migrate data. In addition, you can implement an additional layer of data protection using PST exports, since this approach allows you to recover calendar events, individual emails, contacts and so on without performing a database restoration process.\n\nIn this scenario, you can use third-party tools that support item-level access to the Exchange backup, or you can write a script to perform the necessary actions using built-in Exchange PowerShell capabilities.\n\nIf you plan to create an item-level backup using a set of exported PST files, then you should also ensure that your storage is reliable, since large backup files could be corrupted or overwritten by subsequent backup tasks. To ensure greater reliability, we suggest implementing a 3-2-1 backup strategy, which allows you to maximize your organization's data resilience in case of disaster. The key is keeping several backup copies of data, spread across separate storage sites.\n\nWhen choosing your own implementation of a 3-2-1 strategy, keep in mind that most popular cloud storage providers (AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Storage platform, etc.) offer a geo-distributed architecture that allows them to keep data intact even after massive natural disasters.\n\nYou can export Exchange mailbox to PST to move data to or from an Exchange organization. There is also a script that allows you to automate the task for a set of mailboxes.\n\nHowever, if you are choosing this export feature as a backup tool for Exchange items backup, you should also ensure PST files protection. You can even integrate PST exported files into your existing backup infrastructure. If you do not have one, try our MSP360 Backup for MS Exchange for free in order to test out its cloud backup and Exchange recovery features."

If you pipeline the command to the Format-List cmdlet, you'll only get a limited number of additional useful details:\n• None RequestGUID: The unique GUID value of the mailbox export request.\n• None RequestQueue: The mailbox database that the export request is being run on.\n• None BatchName: The optional batch name for the mailbox export request.\n• None Identity: The unique identity value of the mailbox export request (<MailboxIdentity>\\ <MailboxExportRequestName>).\n\nBy default, the Get-MailboxExportRequestStatistics cmdlet returns the name, status, alias of the source mailbox, and the completion percentage of mailbox export requests. If you pipeline the command to the Format-List cmdlet, you'll see detailed information about the mailbox export request.\n\nThis example returns the summary list of all mailbox export requests.\n\nThis example returns additional information for mailbox export requests from the mailbox Akia Al-Zuhairi.\n\nThis example returns the summary list of in-progress mailbox export requests for mailboxes that reside on the mailbox database named DB01.\n\nThis example returns the summary list of completed mailbox export requests in the batch named Export DB01 PSTs.\n\nFor detailed syntax and parameter information, see Get-MailboxExportRequest.\n\nTo view detailed information about a mailbox export request, use this syntax:\n\nWhere <MailboxExportRequestIdentity> is the identity value of the mailbox export request (<MailboxIdentity>\\ <MailboxExportRequestName> or <RequestGUID>).\n\nThis example returns detailed information for the mailbox export request named MailboxExport for Akia Al-Zuhairi's mailbox, including the log of actions in the Report property.\n\nFor detailed syntax and parameter information, see Get-MailboxExportRequestStatistics.\n\nUse the Exchange Management Shell to modify mailbox export requests\n\nYou can modify mailbox export requests that haven't completed. You can't modify the fundamental settings of an existing request (for example, the source mailbox, target .pst file, the source content in the mailbox, or the destination in the target .pst file).\n\nTo modify a mailbox export request, use this syntax:\n\nThis example modifies the failed mailbox export request for the mailbox of Valeria Barrios to accept up to five corrupted mailbox items.\n\nFor detailed syntax and parameter information, see Set-MailboxExportRequest.\n\nNote: After you modify a suspended or failed mailbox export request, you need to resume it by using the Resume-MailboxExportRequest cmdlet.\n\nHow do you know this worked?\n\nTo verify that you've successfully modified a mailbox export request, replace <MailboxIdentity> and <MailboxExportRequestName> with the appropriate values, and run this command in the Exchange Management Shell to verify the details:\n\nYou can suspend mailbox export requests that are in progress. You can't suspend completed or failed mailbox export requests.\n\nTo suspend a mailbox export request, use this syntax:\n\nThis example suspends the mailbox export request from Kathleen Reiter's mailbox that's named Kathleen Reiter Export.\n\nThis example suspends all in-progress mailbox export requests with the comment \"OK to resume after 10 P.M. on Monday 6/19\"\n\nFor detailed syntax and parameter information, see Suspend-MailboxExportRequest.\n• None You can also use the New-MailboxExportRequest cmdlet with the Suspend switch to create a suspended mailbox export request.\n• None You use the Resume-MailboxExportRequest parameter to resume suspended mailbox export requests.\n\nHow do you know this worked?\n\nTo verify that you've successfully suspended a mailbox export request, do any of these steps:\n• None Replace <MailboxIdentity> with the name, email address, or alias of the source mailbox, run this command in the Exchange Management Shell, and verify that the Status property has the value :\n• None Run this command in the Exchange Management Shell, and verify that the suspended mailbox export request is listed:\n\nUse the Exchange Management Shell to resume mailbox export requests\n\nYou can resume suspended or failed mailbox export requests.\n\nTo resume a mailbox export request, use this syntax:\n\nThis example resumes the failed mailbox export request for Valeria Barrios' mailbox.\n\nThis example resumes all suspended mailbox export requests.\n\nFor detailed syntax and parameter information, see Resume-MailboxExportRequest.\n\nHow do you know this worked?\n\nTo verify that you've successfully resumed a mailbox export request, replace <MailboxIdentity> with the name, email address, or alias of the source mailbox, run this command in the Exchange Management Shell, and verify that the Status property doesn't have the value :\n\nUse the Exchange Management Shell to remove mailbox export requests\n\nYou can remove fully or partially completed mailbox export requests.\n• None If you remove a partially completed mailbox export request, the request is removed from the MRS job queue. Any content that's already been exported from the source mailbox isn't removed from the target .pst file.\n• None By default, completed mailbox export request are removed after 30 days (you can override this value with the CompletedRequestAgeLimit parameter), and failed requests aren't automatically removed. But, if you use the RequestExpiryInterval parameter when you create or modify a mailbox export request, these results are available:\n• None RequestExpiryInterval with a timespan value: Completed and failed requests are automatically removed after the specified timespan.\n• None RequestExpiryInterval with the value unlimited: Completed and failed requests aren't automatically removed.\n\nThis example removes the mailbox export request named MailboxExport for Akia Al-Zuhairi's mailbox.\n\nThis example removes all completed mailbox export requests.\n\nFor detailed syntax and parameter information, see Remove-MailboxExportRequest.\n\nHow do you know this worked?\n\nTo verify that you've successfully removed a mailbox export request, replace <MailboxIdentity> with the name, email address, or alias of the source mailbox, run this command in the Exchange Management Shell, and verify that the mailbox export request isn't listed:"

        "document": "In some cases, you may need to export certain Microsoft Exchange mailboxes to PST files for backup or export purposes. In this guide, we will explain how to perform bulk exports of user mailboxes in Microsoft Exchange.\n\n\n\nBefore exporting or backing up data from a user mailbox, you need to do the following.\n• Gain necessary Exchange permissions. Exchange server by default does not allow you to export mailboxes. It is even prohibited for Exchange Organization Administrators members.\n• Prepare a storage folder for data export. It is better to use a network file path - we will discuss it below.\n\nYou can gain the necessary rights by running the following command in Exchange Management Shell with the account having security groups management rights:\n\nChange DOMAIN\\USER to the account from which you will perform the export.\n\nCreate a network share for the folder you will use as a PST storage. Since a mailbox export can perform on the Exchange server with a Client Access Server (CAS) role, it is necessary to ensure access to the selected folder. A network share is a good option if you use a few CAS servers or prefer to store mailbox data somewhere outside. Assign “Write” permissions to the network share for the user or group with “Mailbox Import Export\" rights.\n\nHow to Export Exchange Mailbox to PST with PowerShell Script\n\nMS Exchange has the command New-MailboxExportRequest, which you can use in Exchange Management Shell:\n\n New-MailboxExportRequest -Mailbox user_name -FilePath \"\\\\server_name\\ShareName\\Filename.pst\" Replace user_name with target user account name, and paste the network share URI next to the FilePath option. You can also use the following options for better exporting customization:\n\n \n\n - Name used to name the particular request if you want to execute a few requests per single mailbox. It will just simplify the status check.\n\n - ExcludeFolders and -IncludeFolders allows managing whether Exchange will export certain mailbox folders or not. Read the full list of parameters on the command info page.\n\n Note: if you get the “commandlet not found” error after entering the above command, you need to launch Exchange Management Shell using elevated privileges. Just right-click the Exchange Management Shell icon and choose Run as administrator. \n\n The Exchange will queue the export request and execute it as soon as possible. If the target mailbox is big or you need to export a few mailboxes - check the exporting status using this command:\n\n Get-MailboxExportRequestStatistics After the export has completed, you will see the desired PST file by the network path specified. If you need to export a few mailboxes at once, then you can create a simple script:\n\n \n\n First, let’s create a PowerShell variable to store the list of usernames:\n\n \n\n $userMailboxes = \"user1\", \"user2, \"userN\" \n\n Use the variable from the previous step as a script parameter:\n\n \n\n foreach ($User in ($$userMailboxes)) { New-MailboxExportRequest -Mailbox $User -FilePath \"\\\\localhost\\MailboxExports\\$($User).pst\" } For each $User means every entry in the $userMailboxes. $mailboxusers with the variable you created ($User means every entry in the variable). Then replace the target file path before the “$($User).pst” part - it helps to name every single PST file with a user account name. You can run the script using Windows Task Scheduler to create mailbox-level backups regularly. But keep in mind that mailbox export is a time-consuming task which puts an additional load on the Exchange server with a CAS role.\n\nIn most cases, export Exchange mailbox to PST is not a good way to back up Exchange data because it is slow, complex, and places heavy loads on Exchange servers. That said, it is a good solution if you want simply to make a few copies of a mailbox and move them outside, or if you need to migrate data. In addition, you can implement an additional layer of data protection using PST exports, since this approach allows you to recover calendar events, individual emails, contacts and so on without performing a database restoration process.\n\nIn this scenario, you can use third-party tools that support item-level access to the Exchange backup, or you can write a script to perform the necessary actions using built-in Exchange PowerShell capabilities.\n\nIf you plan to create an item-level backup using a set of exported PST files, then you should also ensure that your storage is reliable, since large backup files could be corrupted or overwritten by subsequent backup tasks. To ensure greater reliability, we suggest implementing a 3-2-1 backup strategy, which allows you to maximize your organization's data resilience in case of disaster. The key is keeping several backup copies of data, spread across separate storage sites.\n\nWhen choosing your own implementation of a 3-2-1 strategy, keep in mind that most popular cloud storage providers (AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Storage platform, etc.) offer a geo-distributed architecture that allows them to keep data intact even after massive natural disasters.\n\nYou can export Exchange mailbox to PST to move data to or from an Exchange organization. There is also a script that allows you to automate the task for a set of mailboxes.\n\nHowever, if you are choosing this export feature as a backup tool for Exchange items backup, you should also ensure PST files protection. You can even integrate PST exported files into your existing backup infrastructure. If you do not have one, try our MSP360 Backup for MS Exchange for free in order to test out its cloud backup and Exchange recovery features."

        "document": "An email organization lives and dies by mailbox backups. Unfortunately, all Microsoft Exchange versions, including Exchange 2019 and 2016, come with limited brick-level backup capabilities. Basically, the only available granular option is an export to PST files. This can be done via Outlook (obviously), PowerShell and in some cases also via Exchange Management Console / Control Panel. In this article I discuss the options available via PowerShell in: Exchange 2019, Exchange 2016, Exchange 2013 and Exchange 2010.\n\nIf you prefer a video guide of this process, visit Export Exchange mailbox data to PST with PowerShell (video guide).\n\nNote: To export Exchange 2007 mailboxes to PST files, use the Export-Mailbox cmdlet. If you are using Exchange Online, exporting mailboxes to PST requires a different approach, described in this article.\n\nBefore we get down to scripting, I would like to say a few words about mailbox export to PST and PST files in general.\n\nPST (Personal Storage Table) files have been the primary means of mailbox backup since early versions of Outlook. While newer, modern Outlook versions depend primarily on OST (Offline Storage Table) files, PSTs are still there. That’s because they require no third-party tools plus are simple to use and supported by pretty much any Outlook version. Additionally, both users and admins can export mailbox items to this format.\n\nThe three main purposes of PST files are as follows:\n• Migration (for example from Exchange 2010 to Exchange Online)\n\nExporting Exchange mailbox contents to a PST file is achieved using the MailboxExportRequest cmdlet. It has only 2 obligatory parameters: –FilePath – defines the network share path of the PST file to which you want to export the data; and –Mailbox – defines the Alias, SMTP address or Display name of the mailbox you will export. Requirements:\n• The user performing the export must be a member of a role group which has the Mailbox Import Export role added. The easiest way to assign it is running this script: To learn more see the “Add a role to a role group” section of this Microsoft article.\n• The location to which you will export the PST file must be a shared folder.\n\nHere is an example of a mailbox export request, which backs up an entire mailbox to a PST file:\n\nLimiting the scope of exported contents is possible using additional parameters, e.g.:\n\nSpecifies what conditions the contents of a mailbox have to match to be exported into the PST file. The conditions are provided in the form of standard PowerShell logical clauses with several item properties available for filtering (wildcards are supported). Example of a script that exports items received prior to 2013-01-01 with subjects beginning with fwd:\n\nJust what it sounds like. You can choose from all Exchange mailbox folders. There are also two interesting features available:\n• The capability to filter personal folders located under root folders using the <FolderName>/* syntax.\n• The capability to filter well known Exchange mailbox folders regardless of their name in a local language using the #<FolderName>#/* syntax.\n\nHere is an example of a script that exports only the Inbox and Sent Items folders:\n\nA switch parameter, which defines the archive as the only source of the export. Example:\n\nSets the name of an export request. Useful for tracking or if you want to set more than 10 export requests per a single mailbox. This is because by default Exchange assigns only 10 consecutive names to export requests related to a single mailbox (starting with MailboxExport through MailboxExport9) and then stops. To proceed when all 10 default export request names have been taken, you have to either flush your export requests or start assigning your own names using the Name parameter. Example:\n\nA single MailboxExportRequest script can, of course, contain multiple parameters, including ones I didn’t mention. For a full list of available parameters, as well as syntax information and other details, consult this Microsoft article.\n\n\n\n The requirements here are identical as in the case of single mailbox exports:\n• The user performing the export must be a member of a role group which has the Mailbox Import Export role added (see previous section for more).\n• The location to which you will export the PST file must be a shared folder.\n\nSave all mailboxes to a variable (in my case it’s AllMailboxes):\n\nExport all mailboxes to PST files with names based on mailbox aliases (to use a different mailbox property replace the phrase “Alias” with its name):\n\nAdditional parameters can be used just as in single mailbox exports (see the first section of this article).\n\nRun the below script for the same effect as in Method 1 (the only difference is the use of the foreach command instead of piping):\n\nYou will notice that the methods I describe result in exporting all mailboxes located on your servers. If you want to limit the scope of exported mailboxes, you can do so e.g. using the Get-Mailbox -Filter parameter. Here is an example of a script which lists mailboxes belonging to a security group called export1.\n\nNOTE: Using the -Filter parameter with the Get-Mailbox cmdlet results in excluding mailboxes that are defined in the parameter. This is why, to limit the scope of exported mailboxes to e.g. Batch1, you have to use the -Filter parameter to exclude all mailboxes that are not part of Batch1 – hence the use of the -ne (not equals) operator. Adding the -Filter parameter to the Get-Mailbox cmdlets in Method 1 and Method 2 scripts will result in limiting the scope of exported mailboxes.\n\nMailbox backups to PST file: The bright and the dark side\n\nAll in all the drawbacks seem to outweigh the advantages, mainly due to clunky PST handling options and due to the files themselves being rather unstable:\n\nYou can have all the advantages of a PowerShell assisted mailbox-to-PST backup without its drawbacks. CodeTwo Backup for Exchange allows for secure granular mailbox backups to a stable and easily managed database. The software allows for scheduling multiple simultaneous backup and restore jobs, includes a smart versioning mechanism, full item search and preview, and additionally, allows for archiving storages to PST files as one of two available archiving models Learn more about CodeTwo Backup examples of use\n\nAs I’ve already mentioned, PST files can be used to migrate from one Exchange Server to another (including Exchange Online). This migration method is also called the manual migration – you don’t create migration endpoints, but rather recreate environment from scratch and import the mailbox contents from CSV files afterwards.\n\nRealistically, if you have more than a couple of mailboxes to migrate, PST migration won’t do. The amount of work it requires together with poor reliability of PST files make it one of the most stressful procedures known to IT.\n\nIf you want to save yourself a lot of time and nerves, take a look at our migration solutions:\n\nCodeTwo Exchange Migration – a tool which allows you to migrate from Exchange Server version 2010+, Exchange Online, or IMAP server directly to any other Exchange Server, including Exchange 2019.\n\nCodeTwo Office 365 Migration – the solution which helps organizations migrate from any source server to Exchange Online.

        "document": "Microsoft Exchange Server is an essential email and collaboration tool in modern enterprises. Enterprise users rely on Exchange daily for email communication, calendar scheduling, contact management, and more. In backup and recovery strategies, it is sometimes necessary to export Exchange mailboxes to PST (Personal Storage Table) files for purposes such as archiving, migration, compliance investigations, or data recovery.\n\nPST (Personal Storage Table) is a file format used by Microsoft Outlook to store data, primarily including emails, calendars, contacts, tasks, and other information. It is commonly used to store email data from Outlook on a local computer, allowing users to perform backups, archiving, or data migration. When mailbox space is insufficient, users can archive old emails to a local PST file, thereby freeing up server space. Unlike OST files (Offline Storage Table), PST files are usually manually created to independently store data and can be imported into Outlook on different devices for access. In addition, PST files support large storage capacity; Outlook 2007 and later versions support file sizes of up to 50GB by default. Users can also set a password for PST files to enhance data security.\n\nHow to Import and Export Archived Exchange Mail to PST?\n\nStep 1: Create an Exchange Role Group and Add It to the Mailbox Import Export Management Role\n\nUse the following command to create a role group named \"Enterprise Mail Support,\" assign it the \"Mailbox Import Export\" role permissions, and add the member `exadmin` to it.\n\nTo delete the role group, use the command:\n\nTo export or import mailboxes, you must first create a network shared folder. You need to grant the “Exchange Trusted Subsystem” group read/write permissions to the network share used for exporting or importing mailboxes. If you do not grant this permission, you will receive an error message indicating that Exchange cannot connect to the target mailbox.\n\nUse the following command to export the archive mailbox mail of a user to a PST file:\n\nStep 4: Import the Exported PST File to the User's Primary Mailbox\n\nIf the target folder for importing is not specified, the default is to import into the `#Inbox#` (Inbox) of the user's primary mailbox. Any user-defined folders in the PST file’s Inbox will be created in the primary mailbox Inbox (if they do not already exist). If a mail item already exists in the primary mailbox, duplicates are automatically skipped during the import process.\n\nTo delete completed mailbox import requests, run the following command:\n\nTo delete completed mailbox export requests, run the following command:\n\nUse the script `Export-Mail_DB.ps1` to export user archive mailbox data in bulk based on the database. The PST files are stored in directories named after each database.\n\n2. The operating account must belong to the \"Mailbox Import Export\" role group.\n\nUse the script `Export-Mail_CSV.ps1` to export archived emails of mailbox users listed in a CSV file to PST files in bulk.\n\n2. The operating account must belong to the \"Mailbox Import Export\" role group.\n\nPrepare the CSV file in advance (use the command below to generate it, then adjust the format as needed):\n\nUse the script `ImportMailbox.ps1` to import PST files into users' primary mailboxes. The script automatically recognizes PST file names and imports the identified files into the corresponding mailbox accounts.\n\nUse the following commands to check the status of import requests:\n\n7.
