        "document": "The so-called CSV (Comma Separated Values) format is the most common import and export format for spreadsheets and databases. CSV format was used for many years prior to attempts to describe the format in a standardized way in RFC 4180. The lack of a well-defined standard means that subtle differences often exist in the data produced and consumed by different applications. These differences can make it annoying to process CSV files from multiple sources. Still, while the delimiters and quoting characters vary, the overall format is similar enough that it is possible to write a single module which can efficiently manipulate such data, hiding the details of reading and writing the data from the programmer.\n\nThe module implements classes to read and write tabular data in CSV format. It allows programmers to say, “write this data in the format preferred by Excel,” or “read data from this file which was generated by Excel,” without knowing the precise details of the CSV format used by Excel. Programmers can also describe the CSV formats understood by other applications or define their own special-purpose CSV formats.\n\nThe module’s and objects read and write sequences. Programmers can also read and write data in dictionary form using the and classes.\n\nThe module defines the following functions: Return a reader object that will process lines from the given csvfile. A csvfile must be an iterable of strings, each in the reader’s defined csv format. A csvfile is most commonly a file-like object or list. If csvfile is a file object, it should be opened with . An optional dialect parameter can be given which is used to define a set of parameters specific to a particular CSV dialect. It may be an instance of a subclass of the class or one of the strings returned by the function. The other optional fmtparams keyword arguments can be given to override individual formatting parameters in the current dialect. For full details about the dialect and formatting parameters, see section Dialects and Formatting Parameters. Each row read from the csv file is returned as a list of strings. No automatic data type conversion is performed unless the format option is specified (in which case unquoted fields are transformed into floats). Return a writer object responsible for converting the user’s data into delimited strings on the given file-like object. csvfile can be any object with a method. If csvfile is a file object, it should be opened with . An optional dialect parameter can be given which is used to define a set of parameters specific to a particular CSV dialect. It may be an instance of a subclass of the class or one of the strings returned by the function. The other optional fmtparams keyword arguments can be given to override individual formatting parameters in the current dialect. For full details about dialects and formatting parameters, see the Dialects and Formatting Parameters section. To make it as easy as possible to interface with modules which implement the DB API, the value is written as the empty string. While this isn’t a reversible transformation, it makes it easier to dump SQL NULL data values to CSV files without preprocessing the data returned from a call. All other non-string data are stringified with before being written. Associate dialect with name. name must be a string. The dialect can be specified either by passing a sub-class of , or by fmtparams keyword arguments, or both, with keyword arguments overriding parameters of the dialect. For full details about dialects and formatting parameters, see section Dialects and Formatting Parameters. Delete the dialect associated with name from the dialect registry. An is raised if name is not a registered dialect name. Return the dialect associated with name. An is raised if name is not a registered dialect name. This function returns an immutable . Return the names of all registered dialects. Returns the current maximum field size allowed by the parser. If new_limit is given, this becomes the new limit. The module defines the following classes: Create an object that operates like a regular reader but maps the information in each row to a whose keys are given by the optional fieldnames parameter. The fieldnames parameter is a sequence. If fieldnames is omitted, the values in the first row of file f will be used as the fieldnames and will be omitted from the results. If fieldnames is provided, they will be used and the first row will be included in the results. Regardless of how the fieldnames are determined, the dictionary preserves their original ordering. If a row has more fields than fieldnames, the remaining data is put in a list and stored with the fieldname specified by restkey (which defaults to ). If a non-blank row has fewer fields than fieldnames, the missing values are filled-in with the value of restval (which defaults to ). All other optional or keyword arguments are passed to the underlying instance. If the argument passed to fieldnames is an iterator, it will be coerced to a . Changed in version 3.6: Returned rows are now of type . Changed in version 3.8: Returned rows are now of type . Create an object which operates like a regular writer but maps dictionaries onto output rows. The fieldnames parameter is a of keys that identify the order in which values in the dictionary passed to the method are written to file f. The optional restval parameter specifies the value to be written if the dictionary is missing a key in fieldnames. If the dictionary passed to the method contains a key not found in fieldnames, the optional extrasaction parameter indicates what action to take. If it is set to , the default value, a is raised. If it is set to , extra values in the dictionary are ignored. Any other optional or keyword arguments are passed to the underlying instance. Note that unlike the class, the fieldnames parameter of the class is not optional. If the argument passed to fieldnames is an iterator, it will be coerced to a . The class is a container class whose attributes contain information for how to handle doublequotes, whitespace, delimiters, etc. Due to the lack of a strict CSV specification, different applications produce subtly different CSV data. instances define how and instances behave. All available names are returned by , and they can be registered with specific and classes through their initializer ( ) functions like this: The class defines the usual properties of an Excel-generated CSV file. It is registered with the dialect name . The class defines the usual properties of an Excel-generated TAB-delimited file. It is registered with the dialect name . The class defines the usual properties of a CSV file generated on UNIX systems, i.e. using as line terminator and quoting all fields. It is registered with the dialect name . The class is used to deduce the format of a CSV file. The class provides two methods: Analyze the given sample and return a subclass reflecting the parameters found. If the optional delimiters parameter is given, it is interpreted as a string containing possible valid delimiter characters. Analyze the sample text (presumed to be in CSV format) and return if the first row appears to be a series of column headers. Inspecting each column, one of two key criteria will be considered to estimate if the sample contains a header:\n• None the second through n-th rows contain numeric values\n• None the second through n-th rows contain strings where at least one value’s length differs from that of the putative header of that column. Twenty rows after the first row are sampled; if more than half of columns + rows meet the criteria, is returned. This method is a rough heuristic and may produce both false positives and negatives. An example for use: The module defines the following constants: Instructs objects to quote all fields. Instructs objects to only quote those fields which contain special characters such as delimiter, quotechar or any of the characters in lineterminator. Instructs objects to quote all non-numeric fields. Instructs objects to convert all non-quoted fields to type float. Instructs objects to never quote fields. When the current delimiter occurs in output data it is preceded by the current escapechar character. If escapechar is not set, the writer will raise if any characters that require escaping are encountered. Instructs objects to perform no special processing of quote characters. Instructs objects to quote all fields which are not . This is similar to , except that if a field value is an empty (unquoted) string is written. Instructs objects to interpret an empty (unquoted) field as and to otherwise behave as . Instructs objects to always place quotes around fields which are strings. This is similar to , except that if a field value is an empty (unquoted) string is written. Instructs objects to interpret an empty (unquoted) string as and to otherwise behave as . The module defines the following exception: Raised by any of the functions when an error is detected.\n\nTo make it easier to specify the format of input and output records, specific formatting parameters are grouped together into dialects. A dialect is a subclass of the class containing various attributes describing the format of the CSV file. When creating or objects, the programmer can specify a string or a subclass of the class as the dialect parameter. In addition to, or instead of, the dialect parameter, the programmer can also specify individual formatting parameters, which have the same names as the attributes defined below for the class. A one-character string used to separate fields. It defaults to . Controls how instances of quotechar appearing inside a field should themselves be quoted. When , the character is doubled. When , the escapechar is used as a prefix to the quotechar. It defaults to . On output, if doublequote is and no escapechar is set, is raised if a quotechar is found in a field. A one-character string used by the writer to escape the delimiter if quoting is set to and the quotechar if doublequote is . On reading, the escapechar removes any special meaning from the following character. It defaults to , which disables escaping. Changed in version 3.11: An empty escapechar is not allowed. The string used to terminate lines produced by the . It defaults to . The is hard-coded to recognise either or as end-of-line, and ignores lineterminator. This behavior may change in the future. A one-character string used to quote fields containing special characters, such as the delimiter or quotechar, or which contain new-line characters. It defaults to . Changed in version 3.11: An empty quotechar is not allowed. Controls when quotes should be generated by the writer and recognised by the reader. It can take on any of the QUOTE_* constants and defaults to . When , spaces immediately following the delimiter are ignored. The default is . When , raise exception on bad CSV input. The default is .\n\nThe simplest example of reading a CSV file: The corresponding simplest possible writing example is: Since is used to open a CSV file for reading, the file will by default be decoded into unicode using the system default encoding (see ). To decode a file using a different encoding, use the argument of open: The same applies to writing in something other than the system default encoding: specify the encoding argument when opening the output file. A slightly more advanced use of the reader — catching and reporting errors: And while the module doesn’t directly support parsing strings, it can easily be done:"

A CSV file can be opened in Google Sheets or Excel and will be formatted as a spreadsheet. However, a CSV file is actually a plain-text file. It can also be opened with a text editor program such as Atom. CSVs give us a good, simple way to organize data without using a database program. It’s easy to read from and write to CSV files with Python.\n\nThis is a built-in module, so you do not need to install it, However, you must import it in any script that uses it. After the import, you can use any of the methods that are part of the module: Note that using methods from the module will also involve use of Python’s file handling functions, such as . These are covered in Reading and Writing Files here.\n\nThis creates a new CSV file and fills it, row by row. # open new file for writing - will erase file if it already exists - # make a new variable - c - for Python's CSV writer object - # write a column headings row - do this only once - # for purposes of the template, here is a list of lists - # use a for-loop to write each row into the CSV file # write one row to csv — item MUST BE a LIST Note that lines 13–25 above would normally be replaced by a for-loop that incorporates a function that creates one row to be written to the CSV. That function might be scraping hundreds of web pages one at a time, for example. In that case, what is scraped from one page is written as one row in the CSV.\n• None Create a CSV writer object and assign it to a new variable.\n• None Write the header row into the CSV.\n• None Write all the other rows into the CSV. Normally this will involve a for-loop.\n\nThe following example script uses a CSV file named presidents.csv. It contains 46 rows: one row for each U.S. president, plus a header row at the top. The script opens the CSV and then can get all rows from it. Above, the top rows of the CSV file as seen in Excel. # make a new variable - c - for Python's CSV reader object - # read whatever you want from the reader object # print it or use it any way you like Note that in line 13 above, is a Python list, and so we can use list indexes to get only the second item — — and the sixth item — . When we use , each row from the CSV file is a Python list of strings. The code above will print 46 lines, starting like this:\n• None Create a CSV reader object and assign it to a new variable.\n• None Use a for-loop to read from all rows in the CSV.\n\nThe method is used to convert a CSV file to a Python dictionary. You read from an existing CSV and create a Python dictionary from it. Note, the CSV file is unchanged, and the dictionary does not exist as a separate file. # make a new variable - c - for Python's DictReader object - # read whatever you want from the DictReader object # using the column headings from the CSV as the dict keys The key difference between this and the previous script here is in line 13: You can access data from the CSV using dictionary keys instead of list indexes. For working with a CSV with a lot of columns, this is really nice! You can read generally about Python dictionaries here: Dictionaries See also: Converting a CSV to a dictionary\n\nThe method will write to a CSV file using rows of data that are already formatted as dictionaries. If your data is already a list of dictionaries, as in the following example, you can use to write to a normal CSV. # normally this would be in a separate file, or # open a new file for writing - if file exists, contents will be erased # make a new variable - c - for Python's DictWriter object - # write all rows from list to file\n\nSweigart covers this in chapter 16 in Automate the Boring Stuff with Python (second edition). After the import, you can use any of the methods that are part of the module: Using converts a string of JSON data into a Python dictionary. In the example above, would be that new Python dictionary. Using converts a Python value into a string of JSON data. In the example above, would be that new string."

        "document": "Let’s face it: you need to get information into and out of your programs through more than just the keyboard and console. Exchanging information through text files is a common way to share info between programs. One of the most popular formats for exchanging data is the CSV format. But how do you use it?\n\nLet’s get one thing clear: you don’t have to (and you won’t) build your own CSV parser from scratch. There are several perfectly acceptable libraries you can use. The Python library will work for most cases. If your work requires lots of data or numerical analysis, the library has CSV parsing capabilities as well, which should handle the rest.\n\nIn this article, you’ll learn how to read, process, and parse CSV from text files using Python. You’ll see how CSV files work, learn the all-important library built into Python, and see how CSV parsing works using the library.\n\nA CSV file (Comma Separated Values file) is a type of plain text file that uses specific structuring to arrange tabular data. Because it’s a plain text file, it can contain only actual text data—in other words, printable ASCII or Unicode characters. The structure of a CSV file is given away by its name. Normally, CSV files use a comma to separate each specific data value. Here’s what that structure looks like: column 1 name,column 2 name, column 3 name first row data 1,first row data 2,first row data 3 second row data 1,second row data 2,second row data 3 ... Notice how each piece of data is separated by a comma. Normally, the first line identifies each piece of data—in other words, the name of a data column. Every subsequent line after that is actual data and is limited only by file size constraints. In general, the separator character is called a delimiter, and the comma is not the only one used. Other popular delimiters include the tab ( ), colon ( ) and semi-colon ( ) characters. Properly parsing a CSV file requires us to know which delimiter is being used. Where Do CSV Files Come From? CSV files are normally created by programs that handle large amounts of data. They are a convenient way to export data from spreadsheets and databases as well as import or use it in other programs. For example, you might export the results of a data mining program to a CSV file and then import that into a spreadsheet to analyze the data, generate graphs for a presentation, or prepare a report for publication. CSV files are very easy to work with programmatically. Any language that supports text file input and string manipulation (like Python) can work with CSV files directly.\n\nThe library provides functionality to both read from and write to CSV files. Designed to work out of the box with Excel-generated CSV files, it is easily adapted to work with a variety of CSV formats. The library contains objects and other code to read, write, and process data from and to CSV files. Reading from a CSV file is done using the object. The CSV file is opened as a text file with Python’s built-in function, which returns a file object. This is then passed to the , which does the heavy lifting. department, and was born in This results in the following output: John Smith works in the Accounting department, and was born in November. Erica Meyers works in the IT department, and was born in March. Each row returned by the is a list of elements containing the data found by removing the delimiters. The first row returned contains the column names, which is handled in a special way. Rather than deal with a list of individual elements, you can read CSV data directly into a dictionary (technically, an Ordered Dictionary) as well. Again, our input file, is as follows: Here’s the code to read it in as a dictionary this time: department, and was born in This results in the same output as before: John Smith works in the Accounting department, and was born in November. Erica Meyers works in the IT department, and was born in March. Where did the dictionary keys come from? The first line of the CSV file is assumed to contain the keys to use to build the dictionary. If you don’t have these in your CSV file, you should specify your own keys by setting the optional parameter to a list containing them. The object can handle different styles of CSV files by specifying additional parameters, some of which are shown below:\n• specifies the character used to separate each field. The default is the comma ( ).\n• specifies the character used to surround fields that contain the delimiter character. The default is a double quote ( ).\n• specifies the character used to escape the delimiter character, in case quotes aren’t used. The default is no escape character. These parameters deserve some more explanation. Suppose you’re working with the following file: This CSV file contains three fields: , , and , which are delimited by commas. The problem is that the data for the field also contains a comma to signify the zip code. There are three different ways to handle this situation:\n• Use a different delimiter\n\n That way, the comma can safely be used in the data itself. You use the optional parameter to specify the new delimiter.\n• Wrap the data in quotes\n\n The special nature of your chosen delimiter is ignored in quoted strings. Therefore, you can specify the character used for quoting with the optional parameter. As long as that character also doesn’t appear in the data, you’re fine.\n• Escape the delimiter characters in the data\n\n Escape characters work just as they do in format strings, nullifying the interpretation of the character being escaped (in this case, the delimiter). If an escape character is used, it must be specified using the optional parameter. You can also write to a CSV file using a object and the method: The optional parameter tells the which character to use to quote fields when writing. Whether quoting is used or not, however, is determined by the optional parameter:\n• If is set to , then will quote fields only if they contain the or the . This is the default case.\n• If is set to , then will quote all fields.\n• If is set to , then will quote all fields containing text data and convert all numeric fields to the data type.\n• If is set to , then will escape delimiters instead of quoting them. In this case, you also must provide a value for the optional parameter. Reading the file back in plain text shows that the file is created as follows: Since you can read our data into a dictionary, it’s only fair that you should be able to write it out from a dictionary as well: Unlike , the parameter is required when writing a dictionary. This makes sense, when you think about it: without a list of , the can’t know which keys to use to retrieve values from your dictionaries. It also uses the keys in to write out the first row as column names. The code above generates the following output file:\n\nOf course, the Python CSV library isn’t the only game in town. Reading CSV files is possible in as well. It is highly recommended if you have a lot of data to analyze. is an open-source Python library that provides high performance data analysis tools and easy to use data structures. is available for all Python installations, but it is a key part of the Anaconda distribution and works extremely well in Jupyter notebooks to share data, code, analysis results, visualizations, and narrative text.

For an in-depth treatment on using to read and analyze large data sets, check out Shantnu Tiwari’s superb article on working with large Excel files in pandas.

To use a different column as the index, add the optional parameter: Now the field is our index: Next, let’s fix the data type of the field. You can force to read data as a date with the optional parameter, which is defined as a list of column names to treat as dates: Notice the difference in the output: The date is now formatted properly, which is easily confirmed in interactive mode: If your CSV files doesn’t have column names in the first line, you can use the optional parameter to provide a list of column names. You can also use this if you want to override the column names provided in the first line. In this case, you must also tell to ignore existing column names using the optional parameter: Notice that, since the column names changed, the columns specified in the and optional parameters must also be changed. This now results in the following output: Of course, if you can’t get your data out of again, it doesn’t do you much good. Writing a to a CSV file is just as easy as reading one in. Let’s write the data with the new column names to a new CSV file: The only difference between this code and the reading code above is that the call was replaced with , providing the file name. The new CSV file looks like this:"

The only remaining issue that I cannot seem to resolve is that the enumerate winds up duplicating the two columns since it makes one pass through the loop for row_ID and one for row (each causes the two columns to be added). Once I have this resolved, I will post the final code here for others who review this post. Thank you again! The code in my post does not double the columns. Please, post your code in code tags to see what the problem is. Also, can you elaborate on the difference between the two ID numbers - do they both start at 1 and are virtually identical? \n\n \n\n with open(in_file, 'r') as in_f, open(out_file, 'w', newline='') as out_f: rdr = csv.DictReader(in_f) fieldnames = ['Purchase Order Number', 'Purchases Transaction ID Number'] fieldnames.extend(rdr.fieldnames) wrtr = csv.DictWriter(out_f, fieldnames=fieldnames) wrtr.writeheader() for row_id, row in enumerate(rdr, start=1): row['Purchase Order Number'] = '{:0>7}'.format(row_id + 60000) row['Purchases Transaction ID Number'] = '{:0>6}'.format(row_id + 700000) wrtr.writerow(row) Sorry, here is the code, in tags. It seems the for loop will run once for row_ID and once for row hence the double entry in my CSV file. Maybe I'm wrong about why this is happening but it is happening. I have tried variations to fix it but to no avail. You will note that the two numbers do start at different points (as below, one starts at 60000 and the other at 700000).

Because you said you want to ADD my understanding was you need to add the column headers to one already in input file. That is lines#3-#4. If this is the case, try:"

        "document": "The so-called CSV (Comma Separated Values) format is the most common import and export format for spreadsheets and databases. CSV format was used for many years prior to attempts to describe the format in a standardized way in RFC 4180. The lack of a well-defined standard means that subtle differences often exist in the data produced and consumed by different applications. These differences can make it annoying to process CSV files from multiple sources. Still, while the delimiters and quoting characters vary, the overall format is similar enough that it is possible to write a single module which can efficiently manipulate such data, hiding the details of reading and writing the data from the programmer.\n\nThe module implements classes to read and write tabular data in CSV format. It allows programmers to say, “write this data in the format preferred by Excel,” or “read data from this file which was generated by Excel,” without knowing the precise details of the CSV format used by Excel. Programmers can also describe the CSV formats understood by other applications or define their own special-purpose CSV formats.\n\nThe module’s and objects read and write sequences. Programmers can also read and write data in dictionary form using the and classes.\n\nThe module defines the following functions: Return a reader object that will process lines from the given csvfile. A csvfile must be an iterable of strings, each in the reader’s defined csv format. A csvfile is most commonly a file-like object or list. If csvfile is a file object, it should be opened with . An optional dialect parameter can be given which is used to define a set of parameters specific to a particular CSV dialect. It may be an instance of a subclass of the class or one of the strings returned by the function. The other optional fmtparams keyword arguments can be given to override individual formatting parameters in the current dialect. For full details about the dialect and formatting parameters, see section Dialects and Formatting Parameters. Each row read from the csv file is returned as a list of strings. No automatic data type conversion is performed unless the format option is specified (in which case unquoted fields are transformed into floats). Return a writer object responsible for converting the user’s data into delimited strings on the given file-like object. csvfile can be any object with a method. If csvfile is a file object, it should be opened with . An optional dialect parameter can be given which is used to define a set of parameters specific to a particular CSV dialect. It may be an instance of a subclass of the class or one of the strings returned by the function. The other optional fmtparams keyword arguments can be given to override individual formatting parameters in the current dialect. For full details about dialects and formatting parameters, see the Dialects and Formatting Parameters section. To make it as easy as possible to interface with modules which implement the DB API, the value is written as the empty string. While this isn’t a reversible transformation, it makes it easier to dump SQL NULL data values to CSV files without preprocessing the data returned from a call. All other non-string data are stringified with before being written. Associate dialect with name. name must be a string. The dialect can be specified either by passing a sub-class of , or by fmtparams keyword arguments, or both, with keyword arguments overriding parameters of the dialect. For full details about dialects and formatting parameters, see section Dialects and Formatting Parameters. Delete the dialect associated with name from the dialect registry. An is raised if name is not a registered dialect name. Return the dialect associated with name. An is raised if name is not a registered dialect name. This function returns an immutable . Return the names of all registered dialects. Returns the current maximum field size allowed by the parser. If new_limit is given, this becomes the new limit. The module defines the following classes: Create an object that operates like a regular reader but maps the information in each row to a whose keys are given by the optional fieldnames parameter. The fieldnames parameter is a sequence. If fieldnames is omitted, the values in the first row of file f will be used as the fieldnames and will be omitted from the results. If fieldnames is provided, they will be used and the first row will be included in the results. Regardless of how the fieldnames are determined, the dictionary preserves their original ordering. If a row has more fields than fieldnames, the remaining data is put in a list and stored with the fieldname specified by restkey (which defaults to ). If a non-blank row has fewer fields than fieldnames, the missing values are filled-in with the value of restval (which defaults to ). All other optional or keyword arguments are passed to the underlying instance. If the argument passed to fieldnames is an iterator, it will be coerced to a . Changed in version 3.6: Returned rows are now of type . Changed in version 3.8: Returned rows are now of type . Create an object which operates like a regular writer but maps dictionaries onto output rows. The fieldnames parameter is a of keys that identify the order in which values in the dictionary passed to the method are written to file f. The optional restval parameter specifies the value to be written if the dictionary is missing a key in fieldnames. If the dictionary passed to the method contains a key not found in fieldnames, the optional extrasaction parameter indicates what action to take. If it is set to , the default value, a is raised. If it is set to , extra values in the dictionary are ignored. Any other optional or keyword arguments are passed to the underlying instance. Note that unlike the class, the fieldnames parameter of the class is not optional. If the argument passed to fieldnames is an iterator, it will be coerced to a . The class is a container class whose attributes contain information for how to handle doublequotes, whitespace, delimiters, etc. Due to the lack of a strict CSV specification, different applications produce subtly different CSV data. instances define how and instances behave. All available names are returned by , and they can be registered with specific and classes through their initializer ( ) functions like this: The class defines the usual properties of an Excel-generated CSV file. It is registered with the dialect name . The class defines the usual properties of an Excel-generated TAB-delimited file. It is registered with the dialect name . The class defines the usual properties of a CSV file generated on UNIX systems, i.e. using as line terminator and quoting all fields. It is registered with the dialect name . The class is used to deduce the format of a CSV file. The class provides two methods: Analyze the given sample and return a subclass reflecting the parameters found. If the optional delimiters parameter is given, it is interpreted as a string containing possible valid delimiter characters. Analyze the sample text (presumed to be in CSV format) and return if the first row appears to be a series of column headers. Inspecting each column, one of two key criteria will be considered to estimate if the sample contains a header:\n• None the second through n-th rows contain numeric values\n• None the second through n-th rows contain strings where at least one value’s length differs from that of the putative header of that column. Twenty rows after the first row are sampled; if more than half of columns + rows meet the criteria, is returned. This method is a rough heuristic and may produce both false positives and negatives. An example for use: The module defines the following constants: Instructs objects to quote all fields. Instructs objects to only quote those fields which contain special characters such as delimiter, quotechar or any of the characters in lineterminator. Instructs objects to quote all non-numeric fields. Instructs objects to convert all non-quoted fields to type float. Instructs objects to never quote fields. When the current delimiter occurs in output data it is preceded by the current escapechar character. If escapechar is not set, the writer will raise if any characters that require escaping are encountered. Instructs objects to perform no special processing of quote characters. Instructs objects to quote all fields which are not . This is similar to , except that if a field value is an empty (unquoted) string is written. Instructs objects to interpret an empty (unquoted) field as and to otherwise behave as . Instructs objects to always place quotes around fields which are strings. This is similar to , except that if a field value is an empty (unquoted) string is written. Instructs objects to interpret an empty (unquoted) string as and to otherwise behave as . The module defines the following exception: Raised by any of the functions when an error is detected.\n\nTo make it easier to specify the format of input and output records, specific formatting parameters are grouped together into dialects. A dialect is a subclass of the class containing various attributes describing the format of the CSV file. When creating or objects, the programmer can specify a string or a subclass of the class as the dialect parameter. In addition to, or instead of, the dialect parameter, the programmer can also specify individual formatting parameters, which have the same names as the attributes defined below for the class. A one-character string used to separate fields. It defaults to . Controls how instances of quotechar appearing inside a field should themselves be quoted. When , the character is doubled. When , the escapechar is used as a prefix to the quotechar. It defaults to . On output, if doublequote is and no escapechar is set, is raised if a quotechar is found in a field. A one-character string used by the writer to escape the delimiter if quoting is set to and the quotechar if doublequote is . On reading, the escapechar removes any special meaning from the following character. It defaults to , which disables escaping. Changed in version 3.11: An empty escapechar is not allowed. The string used to terminate lines produced by the . It defaults to . The is hard-coded to recognise either or as end-of-line, and ignores lineterminator. This behavior may change in the future. A one-character string used to quote fields containing special characters, such as the delimiter or quotechar, or which contain new-line characters. It defaults to . Changed in version 3.11: An empty quotechar is not allowed. Controls when quotes should be generated by the writer and recognised by the reader. It can take on any of the QUOTE_* constants and defaults to . When , spaces immediately following the delimiter are ignored. The default is . When , raise exception on bad CSV input. The default is .\n\nThe simplest example of reading a CSV file: The corresponding simplest possible writing example is: Since is used to open a CSV file for reading, the file will by default be decoded into unicode using the system default encoding (see ). To decode a file using a different encoding, use the argument of open: The same applies to writing in something other than the system default encoding: specify the encoding argument when opening the output file. A slightly more advanced use of the reader — catching and reporting errors: And while the module doesn’t directly support parsing strings, it can easily be done:"
