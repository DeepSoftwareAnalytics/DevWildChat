        "document": "Multer is a node.js middleware for handling , which is primarily used for uploading files. It is written on top of busboy for maximum efficiency.\n\nNOTE: Multer will not process any form which is not multipart ( ).\n\nThis README is also available in other languages:\n\nMulter adds a object and a or object to the object. The object contains the values of the text fields of the form, the or object contains the files uploaded via the form.\n\nDon’t forget the in your form.\n\nIn case you need to handle a text-only multipart form, you should use the method:\n\nHere’s an example on how multer is used in a HTML form. Take special note of the and fields:\n\nThen in your javascript file you would add these lines to access both the file and the body. It is important that you use the field value from the form in your upload function. This tells multer which field on the request it should look for the files in. If these fields aren’t the same in the HTML form and on your server, your upload will fail:\n\nEach file contains the following information:\n\nMulter accepts an options object, the most basic of which is the property, which tells Multer where to upload the files. In case you omit the options object, the files will be kept in memory and never written to disk.\n\nBy default, Multer will rename the files so as to avoid naming conflicts. The renaming function can be customized according to your needs.\n\nThe following are the options that can be passed to Multer.\n\nIn an average web app, only might be required, and configured as shown in the following example.\n\nIf you want more control over your uploads, you’ll want to use the option instead of . Multer ships with storage engines and ; More engines are available from third parties.\n\nAccept a single file with the name . The single file will be stored in .\n\nAccept an array of files, all with the name . Optionally error out if more than files are uploaded. The array of files will be stored in .\n\nAccept a mix of files, specified by . An object with arrays of files will be stored in .\n\nshould be an array of objects with and optionally a . Example:\n\nAccept only text fields. If any file upload is made, error with code “LIMIT_UNEXPECTED_FILE” will be issued.\n\nAccepts all files that comes over the wire. An array of files will be stored in .\n\nWARNING: Make sure that you always handle the files that a user uploads. Never add multer as a global middleware since a malicious user could upload files to a route that you didn’t anticipate. Only use this function on routes where you are handling the uploaded files.\n\nThe disk storage engine gives you full control on storing files to disk.\n\nThere are two options available, and . They are both functions that determine where the file should be stored.\n\nis used to determine within which folder the uploaded files should be stored. This can also be given as a (e.g. ).

When passing a string, multer will make sure that the directory is created for you.\n\nis used to determine what the file should be named inside the folder. If no is given, each file will be given a random name that doesn’t include any file extension.\n\nNote: Multer will not append any file extension for you, your function should return a filename complete with an file extension.\n\nEach function gets passed both the request ( ) and some information about the file ( ) to aid with the decision.\n\nNote that might not have been fully populated yet. It depends on the order that the client transmits fields and files to the server.\n\nFor understanding the calling convention used in the callback (needing to pass null as the first param), refer to Node.js error handling\n\nThe memory storage engine stores the files in memory as objects. It doesn’t have any options.\n\nWhen using memory storage, the file info will contain a field called that contains the entire file.\n\nWARNING: Uploading very large files, or relatively small files in large numbers very quickly, can cause your application to run out of memory when memory storage is used.\n\nAn object specifying the size limits of the following optional properties. Multer passes this object into busboy directly, and the details of the properties can be found on busboy’s page.\n\nThe following integer values are available:\n\nSpecifying the limits can help protect your site against denial of service (DoS) attacks.\n\nSet this to a function to control which files should be uploaded and which should be skipped. The function should look like this:\n\nWhen encountering an error, Multer will delegate the error to Express. You can display a nice error page using the standard express way.\n\nIf you want to catch errors specifically from Multer, you can call the middleware function by yourself.

        "document": "Express is a routing and middleware web framework that has minimal functionality of its own: An Express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls.\n\nMiddleware functions are functions that have access to the request object ( ), the response object ( ), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named .\n\nMiddleware functions can perform the following tasks:\n• Make changes to the request and the response objects.\n• Call the next middleware function in the stack.\n\nIf the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.\n\nAn Express application can use the following types of middleware:\n\nYou can load application-level and router-level middleware with an optional mount path. You can also load a series of middleware functions together, which creates a sub-stack of the middleware system at a mount point.\n\nBind application-level middleware to an instance of the app object by using the and functions, where is the HTTP method of the request that the middleware function handles (such as GET, PUT, or POST) in lowercase.\n\nThis example shows a middleware function with no mount path. The function is executed every time the app receives a request.\n\nThis example shows a middleware function mounted on the path. The function is executed for any type of HTTP request on the path.\n\nThis example shows a route and its handler function (middleware system). The function handles GET requests to the path.\n\nHere is an example of loading a series of middleware functions at a mount point, with a mount path. It illustrates a middleware sub-stack that prints request info for any type of HTTP request to the path.\n\nRoute handlers enable you to define multiple routes for a path. The example below defines two routes for GET requests to the path. The second route will not cause any problems, but it will never get called because the first route ends the request-response cycle.\n\nThis example shows a middleware sub-stack that handles GET requests to the path.\n\nTo skip the rest of the middleware functions from a router middleware stack, call to pass control to the next route.\n\nThis example shows a middleware sub-stack that handles GET requests to the path.\n\nMiddleware can also be declared in an array for reusability.\n\nThis example shows an array with a middleware sub-stack that handles GET requests to the path\n\nRouter-level middleware works in the same way as application-level middleware, except it is bound to an instance of .\n\nLoad router-level middleware by using the and functions.\n\nThe following example code replicates the middleware system that is shown above for application-level middleware, by using router-level middleware:\n\n// a middleware function with no mount path. This code is executed for every request to the router // a middleware sub-stack shows request info for any type of HTTP request to the /user/:id path // a middleware sub-stack that handles GET requests to the /user/:id path // if the user ID is 0, skip to the next router // otherwise pass control to the next middleware function in this stack // handler for the /user/:id path, which renders a special page // mount the router on the app\n\nTo skip the rest of the router’s middleware functions, call to pass control back out of the router instance.\n\nThis example shows a middleware sub-stack that handles GET requests to the path.\n\nDefine error-handling middleware functions in the same way as other middleware functions, except with four arguments instead of three, specifically with the signature :\n\nFor details about error-handling middleware, see: Error handling.\n\nStarting with version 4.x, Express no longer depends on Connect. The middleware functions that were previously included with Express are now in separate modules; see the list of middleware functions.\n\nExpress has the following built-in middleware functions:\n• express.static serves static assets such as HTML files, images, and so on.\n• express.json parses incoming requests with JSON payloads. NOTE: Available with Express 4.16.0+\n• express.urlencoded parses incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads. NOTE: Available with Express 4.16.0+\n\nUse third-party middleware to add functionality to Express apps.\n\nInstall the Node.js module for the required functionality, then load it in your app at the application level or at the router level.\n\nThe following example illustrates installing and loading the cookie-parsing middleware function .\n\nFor a partial list of third-party middleware functions that are commonly used with Express, see: Third-party middleware."

Node.js and Express.js, coupled with JavaScript, provide a powerful and efficient framework for implementing this functionality. In this blog, we will walk you through the process of uploading and saving images using Node.js, Express.js, and JavaScript. We will also highlight the expertise of CronJ in delivering effective solutions for such applications and provide a list of reference materials and URLs for further learning.\n\nNode.js is a popular, open-source, and cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to build server-side and networking applications using JavaScript (1). Express.js, built on top of Node.js, is a lightweight and flexible web application framework designed to streamline the development of web applications and APIs (2).\n\nJavaScript, on the other hand, is a widely-used programming language that enables developers to create interactive web pages and applications. Combining Node.js, Express.js, and JavaScript offers an efficient, scalable, and easy-to-use ecosystem for web development, including image uploading and saving functionalities (3).\n\nCronJ: The Expert in Node.js, Express.js, and JavaScript Solutions\n\nCronJ, a leading IT solutions provider, is renowned for its expertise in building robust, scalable, and efficient web applications using Node.js, Express.js, and JavaScript. With a team of skilled developers, CronJ delivers end-to-end solutions for a wide array of applications, ensuring seamless integration, optimum performance, and an excellent return on investment for its clients (4).\n\nSetting Up the Environment: Node.js, Express.js, and Multer\n\nBefore implementing image uploading and saving functionality, it’s crucial to set up the development environment. First, install Node.js and create a new project by initializing a package.json file using . Next, install Express.js using and create an file to define your application's entry point.\n\nTo handle file uploads, we need to install Multer, a middleware for handling in Express.js. Multer simplifies the process of accepting and saving images on the server. Install Multer using and require it in your file (5).\n\na. Create an HTML form with an input field of type ‘file’ and a submit button. This form allows users to choose an image file to upload.\n\nb. In your file, configure Multer to store the uploaded images in a specified directory. You can also define file validation rules, such as file size limits and accepted file formats.\n\nc. Create a POST route in your file to handle the form submission. Use the middleware to process the image file and save it to the specified directory.\n\nd. Start your Express.js server by adding the following code to your `app.js` file and running the command `node app.js` in your terminal.\n\nOnce the image has been uploaded, you can save it to a database or a cloud storage service like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Microsoft Azure Blob Storage. In this example, we will demonstrate how to save the uploaded image’s metadata to a MongoDB database using the Mongoose ORM (6).\n\na. Install Mongoose using and require it in your file. Next, establish a connection to your MongoDB database.\n\nb. Create a Mongoose schema and model for the image metadata.\n\nc. Modify your POST route to save the uploaded image’s metadata to the MongoDB database.\n\nIn this blog, we have demonstrated how to upload and save images using Node.js, Express.js, and JavaScript.

        "document": "Recently I was developing a CLI in Node.js that would help make the process of writing articles in Markdown easier for my team. The flow required that a local .md file be parsed, formatted, converted to .docx, and then uploaded to Google Drive as a Google Doc file, all by running one command from the terminal. I approached this project in a few different ways, hoping initially that I could use serverless functions to handle the backend. I hit a lot of dead ends on this route, and eventually decided to build an Express server that I would ultimately host on Heroku. To upload the .docx file contents from my CLI to a secure backend endpoint, where it would then be uploaded to the user’s authenticated Google Drive, I needed a way to directly from Node.js (without a browser). This requires several third party libraries, and it was pretty difficult to make them all play nice together. There weren’t great resources on the internet to help, and a lot of trial and error were involved. This article is going to explain how I did it. In order to follow along with this tutorial, you’ll need the following:\n• Node.js installed on your machine, along with a package manager like Set up your Node.js and express files app structure In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your general projects or development directory, and run the following commands:\n\nThe function is an asynchronous function. Inside the function is a block. This means that the function will “try” to do anything inside the block. If at any point the code encounters an error, it will immediately execute the block, where you can access the offending error. The first thing it tries to do in the block is create two variables: and . The reason line 3, where the variable is created, is highlighted is because you need to replace the file path shown with the path to the file you want to upload. This variable now represents a readable stream of your file.\n\nThe variable is where you’ll store the title of the file you’re uploading - you can change this to whatever string value you like. Beneath these variables is where the form itself is created. Two key/value pairs are appended to the form: one for the file, and one for its title. You can add any number of key/value pairs representing your form data to the object in this manner. Next, the entire form is posted to your Express backend (at an endpoint you’ll create later in this tutorial) using . Note that you’re passing an option object to the method with header information. The library makes it easy to ensure your headers are set correctly by giving you a method that will return headers appropriate to your form data. If there are no errors, then an “Upload complete” message will be logged to the console. Otherwise, the error message will be logged. Now that you’ve successfully sent your file, you need to be able to process it on your backend. In your terminal, navigate to your Express app:\n\nThere are a few things to take note of in this code - the important lines have been highlighted. On line 5, after the package is imported, you’re preparing to use Multer by calling the function, passing to it an options object with a key, and saving the returned object to a variable called . See the documentation for other ways to configure Multer, including saving the file to memory and not to disk. In this case, you’re specifying a value, because Multer needs to save your uploaded file somewhere. For my app, I only needed the file temporarily, so I set the destination to my server’s /tmp folder. If you need the uploaded files to persist, you could store them in another directory on your server, so long as you specify the path in this object. On line 7, before executing the API endpoint’s callback function, you’re calling the method on the object. There are many methods you can call on the object that are appropriate for different data configurations. In this example, because you’re uploading only one file, you’ll use the method. At this point, the object available in the endpoint’s callback function will be slightly different than what you’re used to. Despite not attaching any value to the form when you made the request, the value of your non-file form fields will be available on . The file you uploaded will be available at . In the code above, both of these objects are logged to the console. To see what they look like, test out the project. In your terminal, make sure you’re still inside the directory, and then run the following command:"
