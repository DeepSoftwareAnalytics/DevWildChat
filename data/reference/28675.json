        "document": "Long long time ago, when I was a student, I wrote a paper on genetic algorithms. This is a really exiting topic for me and I always wanted to create something for iOS using genetic algorithms. This article was a long time coming, I hope you’ll enjoy it…\n\nTraveling salesman problem is a well-known problem in computing. The problem is: the salesman has to visit every city on his list, he has to visit each city only once and he has to take the shortest possible route. In this blog article we’ll see how to solve this problem using genetic algorithms.\n\nBefore jumping in the code let’s cover some basics of how genetic algorithms work.\n\nIf you’re familiar with evolution and natural selection you know that most biological organisms reproduce, create an offspring (or children) who reproduce, and so on. Children share the properties of their parents and during the creation of the child there’s a very slight possibility that some of those properties will randomly mutate. Parents die, and the children will start the process again and create a new generation, and so on and so on…\n\nThis very, very slight possibility of mutation is the engine behind biological evolution. You would think that adding random features to an entity is crazy and dangerous, and in most cases it is, for the entity. But every now and then a very useful feature comes along, and that feature is extremely useful for the whole population. Because an entity with useful features has higher chances of reproduction and passing those features to the next generation.\n\nIf you think of it in human timeframe, you might find it difficult to believe. But if you speed the time up, it makes a lot more sense. These tiny mutations is what gave us our eyes, our advanced brains, our intelligence…\n\nWe can clearly isolate three different features of evolution:\n\nEach one of those individually won’t do much. But the three of them working together create a really powerful mechanism that created every living thing on this planet from a single cell.\n\nLet’s see how we can use what we know about evolution and natural selection and apply it to computer science.\n\nWe need a bunch of individuals, or parents if you will. We need a way to measure them so we can select the best parents. Once we select two parents, we need to figure out a way for them to produce an offspring. At the end of that cycle, we have to find a way of mutating that child without corrupting the data.\n\nOur genetic algorithm will have a population of 500 individuals. When we initialize the class we’ll seed this population with random individuals and kick off the algorithm.\n\nFrom the traveling salesman problem it’s easy to identify what our individual should be. It should be the actual route the salesman should take. A route is just a collection of cities with coordinates. Each route has a distance, we’ll be measuring the round trip distance. The salesman should return to the city from which he started his journey.\n\nSelecting individuals is one of the crucial parts of the algorithm. This is called calculating the fitness. We already know that we want the shortest route, but how can we identify which individuals have the best routes. We’ll calculate the total distance of all the individuals in a generation and compare the distance of an individual with the total distance. This will give us a ranking and we’ll easily identify the best individuals. Once we have the individuals ranked, we’ll use a roulette method to select the next two parents for reproduction. The individuals with the highest fitness will have the best chances of being selected. Individuals with the lowest fitness still have chances of being selected, but those chances are slim.\n\nHow do you combine two routes to create a third one? It’s quite simple really. After the selection we, have our two parents. We select a random point in the array and copy all the cities in the route up until that point from the first parent to the child. Then, we simply start copying the second part of the array from the second parent. The only thing to look out for is not to add a city to the route if it’s already in the route. If we reach the end of the second parents’ route, we simply start from the beginning.\n\nA child has been created. We need to mutate it 🙂 Mutation is actually very important in genetic algorithms because it will make sure you don’t hit the local minimum/maximum. Genetic algorithms converge to a solution, and it would be easy for them to be stuck at a local minimum. So we need mutation to get us out of this hole.\n\nChances for mutation are really small. In our case it’ll be 1.5% (usually they’re even smaller than that). We’ll mutate the child by selecting two random points in the route and swapping the cities. It wouldn’t make sense to randomly change the locations of the cities, or start shuffling the array. We need to keep the child in a consistent state.\n\nEnough of the boring stuff, let’s code.\n\nBelieve it or not, we’ll need less than 150 lines of code to make this work. First off, we’ll need our city:\n\nThis is a simple struct. We’ll be using a CGPoint as our location. In a real-world example you’ll probably want to use lat/lon instead. We’ll also need a function to calculate distance to another city.\n\nNext up is the actual route:\n\nThis class has an array of cities. The order of the cities in the array is the order in which the salesman travels. We also have a function that calculates the round trip distance for the entire route. At the bottom of the class we have a function that calculates the fitness. This function will take in a total distance and it will calculate a relative distance and subtract it from 1. This way we’ll give higher relative values to the routes with the shortest distance. Exactly what we need.\n\nNo need to copy paste all the code here, I’ll just go over the most important bits. The actual evolution method will run continuously until explicitly stopped, and it looks like this:\n\nThe meat of the function is the for loop where we iterate over the population. We’re creating parents with a function:\n\nIn this function we’re using a roulette mechanism to select a parent. Parent with the highest fitness has the highest chances of being selected.\n\nNow we have to make an offspring:\n\nLike mentioned earlier. We select a random index in the array, and slice the first parent up until that index. We start filling the ‘cities’ array with the cities from the second parent (starting from the slice). We have to check if the city is already in the ‘cities’ array, and when we reach the end of the array, we start from the beginning.\n\nThere should be a slight possibility of mutation. We’re mutating the offspring with this function:\n\nWe’re simply swapping two locations in the route, if the mutation should occur.\n\nShow It To Me\n\nSome people like to see the code, some people like to see it on the UI. I made a small app that demonstrates this algorithm. The app is simple, the UI i crap, and it’s full of bugs. But hey, it was 2 a.m. and we’re talking about algorithms here 😀 Here’s how the algorithm looks like when run in the app:\n\nAs you can see from the animation. The algorithm is pretty fast at finding the shortest path.\n\nGenetic algorithms are great for solving search problems and optimizations. What gets me all excited about them is how from the initial chaos of the original population we reach a solution.\n\nThat being said, genetic algorithms won’t give you a best solution, compared to all the other solutions. Meaning, there might be a better solution, a shorter path, but the algorithm simply didn’t find it yet. Given enough time, a genetic algorithm will always reach the best solution. But we have to be reasonable, how long is ‘enough time’ and when it reaches the best solution, how will you know it’s the best. It constantly improves on the solution and experiments trying to find the best one. There’s something really cool about that.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this little break from the usual design patterns and algorithms you can find on this blog. And, more importantly, I hope I peaked your interest in genetic algorithms and that you will create something cool with it. You can find the demo project on my GitHub account.\n\nAs always, have a nice day 🙂"

The task is to complete a tour from city 0 (0-based index) to all other cities such that we visit each city exactly once and then at the end come back to city 0 at minimum cost.\n\nNote the difference between Hamiltonian Cycle and TSP. The Hamiltonian cycle problem is to find if there exists a tour that visits every city exactly once. Here we know that Hamiltonian Tour exists (because the graph is complete) and in fact, many such tours exist, the problem is to find a minimum weight Hamiltonian Cycle.\n\nThe given graph is a complete graph, meaning there is an edge between every pair of nodes. A naive approach to solve this problem is to generate all permutations of the nodes, and calculate the cost for each permutation, and select the minimum cost among them. An important observation in the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is that the choice of the starting node does not affect the solution. This is because the optimal path forms a cyclic tour. For example, if the optimal tour is a1→a2→a3→a4→a1, starting from any other node, such as a2, results in the equivalent tour a2→a3→a4→a1→a2 with same total cost. To simplify the problem, we can fix one node (e.g., node 1) as the starting point and only consider permutations of the remaining nodes.\n\n// C++ program to find the shortest possible route // that visits every city exactly once and returns to // Generate all permutations of the remaining nodes // Calculate the cost of the current permutation // Add the cost to return to the starting node // Update the minimum cost if the current cost // Java program to find the shortest possible route // that visits every city exactly once and returns to // Generate all permutations of the remaining nodes // Calculate the cost of the current permutation // Add the cost to return to the starting node // Update the minimum cost if the current cost // function to generate the next lexicographical // Find the first pair where nodes[i] < nodes[i + 1] // Find the smallest element larger than nodes[i] to // Reverse the sequence from i + 1 to the end # Python program to find the shortest possible route # that visits every city exactly once and returns to # Generate all permutations of the # Calculate the cost of the current permutation # Add the cost to return to the starting node # Update the minimum cost if the current cost // C# program to find the shortest possible route // that visits every city exactly once and returns to // Generate all permutations of the remaining nodes // Calculate the cost of the current permutation // Add the cost to return to the starting node // Update the minimum cost if the current cost // Helper function to generate all permutations of a // JavaScript program to find the shortest possible route // that visits every city exactly once and returns to // Generate all permutations of the remaining nodes // Calculate the cost of the current permutation // Add the cost to return to the starting node // Update the minimum cost if the current cost is // Helper function to generate all permutations of an array\n\nTime complexity: O(n!) where n is the number of vertices in the graph. This is because the algorithm uses the next_permutation function which generates all the possible permutations of the vertex set. \n\nAuxiliary Space: O(n) as we are using a vector to store all the vertices."

As in, you aren't computing a path from the previous closest to the current closest, you are trying to get to your goal node, and the current closest is the only thing that matters (e.g. the algorithm doesn't care that last iteration you were 100km away, because this iteration you are only 96km away).\n\nAs a broad introduction, A* doesn't directly construct a path: it explores until it definitely knows that the path is contained within the region it has explored, and then constructs the path based on the information recorded during the exploration.\n\nYou have a two sets of nodes: and\n\nholds nodes that have been fully evaluated, that is, you know exactly how far they are from and all their neighbours are in one of the two sets. This there is no more computation you can do with them and so we can (sort of) ignore them. (Basically these are completely contained within the border.)\n\nholds \"border\" nodes, you know how far these are from , but you haven't touched their neighbours yet, so they are on the edge of your search so far.\n\nAt a given iteration, if you've got nodes to explore (that is, nodes in ), you need to work out which one to explore. This is the job of the heuristic, it basically gives you a hint about which point on the border will be the best to explore next by telling you which node it thinks will have the shortest path to .\n\nThe previous closest node is irrelevant, it just expanded the border a bit, adding new nodes to . These new nodes are now candidates for the closest node in this iteration.\n\nAt first, only contains , but then you iterate and at each step the border is expanded a little (in the most promising direction), until you eventually reach .\n\nWhen A* is actually doing the exploration, it doesn't worry about which nodes came from where. It doesn't need to, because it knows their distance from and the heuristic function and that's all it needs.\n\nHowever to reconstruct the path later, you need to have some record of the path, this is what is. For a given node, links it to the node that is closest to , so you can reconstruct the shortest path by following the links backwards from .\n\nBy passing one of the representations of a graph.\n\nYou need a different heuristic and a different end condition: is no longer a single node any more, but the state of having everything connected; and your heuristic is some estimate of the length of the shortest path connecting the remaining nodes."

What is the shortest possible route that he visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?\n• Let us consider a graph G = (V, E), where V is a set of cities and E is a set of weighted edges. An edge e(u, v) represents that vertices u and v are connected. Distance between vertex u and v is d(u, v), which should be non-negative.\n• We have started in the city and need to visit all the cities once and returns to the same starting city .So, we need to know which is the shortest path to visit all the city.\n• Suppose we have started in city 1 and after visiting some cities now we are in the city .since this will determine which cities are most convenient to visit next.

For example, healthcare optimization models enhance patient care by optimizing resource allocation and surgery scheduling, reducing costs. Similarly, in finance, optimization techniques are employed for portfolio optimization, risk management and algorithmic trading, enabling investors to make informed decisions and maximize returns. Optimization algorithms improve transportation, supply chains, and energy efficiency, promoting sustainability. As technology advances, optimization expands, offering novel solutions to global challenges, shaping industries worldwide.\n• I think we should not take this issue too hard. Because the most possible route is only for choosing the first city to start, and considering that the conquest of all the cities is considered, it is not very important and can be chosen randomly. After choosing the first city, it is a priority to find the neighboring cities, then with the method of completing the outbreak centered on the first city and preferring to choose the direction of the outbreak (which can be random or based on the total of the remaining cities) in the direction where the probability of returning the route is less, The number of selected paths will be as small as possible and we will get closer to the ideal path.\n• Choosing the best algorithm for your specific TSP problem hinges on several factors, including: Problem size: For smaller problems, exact algorithms or sophisticated metaheuristics might be feasible. For larger problems, simpler heuristics or even parallel computing approaches might be necessary. Time constraints: If you need a solution quickly, even if it's not optimal, a faster heuristic might be preferable. Accuracy requirements: If absolute optimality is crucial, an exact algorithm might be necessary, but be prepared for longer processing times. Problem type: If the TSP involves additional constraints, like time windows or specific visit order requirements, specialized algorithms might be needed.\n• Since the problem is NP-Compete runtime will be horrible if the size is large. So you asked yourself: Since it's so costly to find thr best, is it worth it just to find someting better than what you have now? Can you repeatably run to find something better, and adjust to the improvement? Tradeoffs with algorithms like these."

        "document": "Planning a route with multiple stops can significantly improve road trips, deliveries, and everyday travel by streamlining the journey. Google Maps remains an excellent tool for creating multi-stop routes in 2024, thanks to its robust features and user-friendly interface. Mastering Google Maps for multiple stops can save time and enhance your trip, whether for a complex delivery schedule or an ideal vacation itinerary. This article will help you plan your route for a smoother and more enjoyable experience. Let’s explore how to maximize Google Maps’s “multiple stops” feature!\n\nGoogle Maps can handle route optimization for multiple stops, but its capabilities are limited compared to specialized route optimization software. While it’s a great tool for basic navigation, Google Maps doesn’t truly optimize routes in the way that businesses with complex logistics requirements might need. For instance, Google Maps arranges the stops in the order you enter them rather than calculating the most efficient sequence. However, if you have a small number of stops (usually under 10), it can serve as a basic route planner, providing directions and estimated times for each segment. What’s the Difference Between a Route Plan and an Optimized Route? A route plan is a straightforward sequence of stops mapped out for a specific journey. When you plan a route, you’re arranging stops in an order that works for your needs without considering if it’s the most efficient sequence in terms of time or distance. Google Maps is an excellent tool for this, as it allows users to quickly enter addresses and generate a planned route from start to finish. An optimized route, however, goes beyond simply listing stops in order. It arranges stops in the most efficient sequence, minimizing travel time and fuel costs. Optimized routes account for factors such as traffic conditions, time of day, and specific delivery requirements to streamline the journey. In Google Maps, this level of optimization is limited, so businesses often turn to dedicated route optimization software for more advanced routing needs.\n\nWhile Google Maps doesn’t offer true route optimization, you can still make the most out of its capabilities by carefully arranging your stops. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to manually optimize a route using Google Maps, especially if you’re working with a smaller number of destinations. For routes with up to 25 stops, you can use the following steps in Google Maps:\n• Open Google Maps on your device and click on the “Directions” icon.\n• Enter Starting Point : Input your starting location, then add each of your stops in the order you think would be efficient.\n• Reorder Stops : Drag and drop stops to rearrange them. Test a few different orders to see which sequence gives you the shortest estimated time.\n• Evaluate Traffic Conditions : Toggle on live traffic information to check for any delays on certain segments, and adjust stops accordingly.\n• Save the Route : Save or print the directions once you’re satisfied with the arrangement. This method will help you approximate an optimized route, though it may not be perfectly efficient. Optimize More Than 25 Stops in Google Maps If you have more than 25 stops, you’ll run into Google Maps’ limit on the number of destinations. For routes exceeding this limit, consider these alternatives:\n• Break the Route into Smaller Segments : Divide the route into smaller segments of 10-20 stops each. Optimize each segment separately by following the steps above.\n• Use My Maps for Custom Layers : Google My Maps allows you to create custom maps with multiple layers. You can place stops on each layer, but keep in mind this is more useful for visualization than for sequencing.\n• Consider Third-Party Tools : If you need to optimize more than 25 stops efficiently, Google Maps may not be sufficient. Specialized routing software, such as NextBillion.ai can handle large volumes of stops, automate the sequencing process, and provide dynamic re-optimization in real time. While Google Maps is suitable for straightforward, small-scale route planning, larger or more complex routes require specialized software for optimal efficiency.\n\nYou can use the Google Maps application for multi-stop route optimization on your mobile device. Let’s look at the steps on how you can do it on Android or iOS. How to use Google Maps for Multiple Stop on Android Devices? On your Android phone or tablet, open the Google Maps app. Make sure you’re logged into your Google account before you save routes or use personalized features. \n\n \n\nType your starting point into the search bar. You can also use your current location if you tap the “Current Location” button. \n\n \n\nType your first destination into the search bar and choose it from the list that comes up. Click on “Directions”. This will give you the preview and time to cover the distance. \n\n \n\nTap the three dots in the upper right corner and choose “Add stop.” Type in the address of the next stop and then do it again for the last stop. You can change the order of the stops by dragging them up or down in the list. When you’re done adding stops, tap “Done” to go back to the map. To start your trip, press the “Start” button. Google Maps will take you to each stop in the order you tell it to.\n\n\n\n How to Use Google Maps for Multiple Stop on iOS Devices? \n\n \n\n\n\nOn your iPhone or iPad, open the Google Maps app. To save and manage routes, make sure you’re logged into your Google account. \n\n \n\nIn the search bar, type in where you want to start. To use your current location instead, tap the “Current Location” button. In the search bar, type in your destination. Then, pick it from the list that comes up. This place will be your first stop after you tap the “Directions” button. \n\n \n\nTo add a stop, tap the three dots in the upper right corner to bring up a menu, then choose “Add stop.”\n\n Type in the next address and keep adding stops. Drag the stops into the new order you want them to be in.\n\n\n\n To start navigation, press the “Start” button. Google Maps will show you the way to each stop in the right order.\n\n\n\n \n\n It’s easy to use Google Maps for multiple stops on both Android and iOS devices. By following these steps, you can plan your routes more efficiently, whether you’re going on a road trip, making a delivery, or going on a trip with more than one stop. This feature helps you stay on track and make good use of your time.\n\nWhile Google Maps is a powerful tool for navigation and trip planning, it has certain limitations when it comes to optimizing routes with multiple stops. Here are the top three drawbacks:\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nGoogle Maps is designed primarily for straightforward navigation and basic route planning. When dealing with multiple stops, its optimization capabilities are limited. The tool can suggest an efficient route based on distance and time, but it doesn’t account for complex variables like delivery time windows, vehicle capacities, or specific route constraints that are crucial for logistics and business operations. For those seeking advanced route optimization, solutions like NextBillion’s route optimization solution offer more robust features tailored to these needs.\n\n\n\n \n\nGoogle Maps can be hard to use for businesses and people who need to plan routes with lots of stops. You can only add a certain number of stops to a single route on the platform. Usually, that number is ten. Because of this limitation, it can’t be used to plan large routes, like for delivery services or long road trips. When it comes to complex routing needs. NextBillion’s route optimization solution is the best choice because it can handle a lot more stops.\n\n\n\n \n\nGoogle Maps provides real-time traffic updates, but it doesn’t dynamically re-optimize routes with multiple stops based on real-time data like traffic changes, delays, or new stops. This can lead to inefficiencies and increased travel time, particularly for users who rely on precise timing for deliveries or appointments. One of the main difficulties you might encounter while using Google Maps for multi-stop route optimization is that Google Maps only offers this feature up to 10 stops. If you are a business owner or an enterprise looking to have the capability to optimize routes for more than 10 stops, NextBillion.ai can provide you with the necessary capabilities.\n\nMultiple-stop route planning is an essential feature for various industries and activities, providing significant benefits in terms of efficiency, time management, and cost savings. Here are three primary use cases where multiple-stop route planning proves invaluable: One of the most common and impactful use cases for multiple-stop route planning is in the logistics and delivery industry. Companies that manage fleets for delivering goods to multiple locations can greatly benefit from optimized routes.\n• Efficiency: By planning the most efficient routes, delivery companies can minimize travel time and fuel consumption, reducing operational costs.\n• Resource Management: Optimized routes allow for better utilization of vehicles and drivers, maximizing productivity.\n\n\n\n Field service companies that perform maintenance, repair, and installation can benefit most from multi-stop route planning. When routing is efficient, field technicians spend less time traveling between jobs and more time doing useful work. Increased Productivity: Because optimized routes cut down on travel time, technicians can finish more jobs each day. Lower operational costs: Shorter, more efficient routes mean less money spent on fuel and maintenance for vehicles. Better Use of Resources: Route optimization makes sure that the right technician is sent to the right job at the right time, which improves the quality of service and makes the process more efficient. A health tech company used NextBillion.ai to improve sample collection schedules and save 25% on costs. A health tech company used NextBillion.ai’s route optimization to make its schedules for collecting samples better. The optimized routes cut down on travel time and fuel use, which cut operational costs by 25%. This case shows how route optimization can make field service work easier and more productive as a whole. Transportation Management Systems (TMS) have to deal with complicated routing restrictions and find the best ways to keep transportation costs low. Route optimization APIs can help with these problems by making custom solutions that work well with current TMS platforms. Transportation management systems use route optimization to make routes and schedules that work better, which makes service more reliable and customers happier. This is especially important in cities, where heavy traffic and a lot of people can make it hard to plan routes. Better Service Reliability: Buses and taxis will arrive on time because routes and schedules have been optimized, cutting down on wait times. Cost-effectiveness: Using efficient routes cuts down on fuel use and running costs, which makes public transportation more environmentally friendly and less expensive. More riders: When service is reliable and quick, it brings in more customers, which increases overall ridership and revenue. How NextBillion.ai helped top TMS providers deal with tricky routing issues and lower API costs by 40% Route optimization has many uses in many fields, from logistics and field services to transportation management. By using advanced route planning technologies, businesses can be more efficient, save money, and provide better service."
