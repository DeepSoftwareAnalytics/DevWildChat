Clearing the session removes all the nodes left over from previous models, freeing memory and preventing slowdown.\n\nTensorFlow is lazy-evaluated by default. TensorFlow operations aren't evaluated immediately: creating a tensor or doing some operations to it creates nodes in a dataflow graph. The results are calculated by evaluating the relevant parts of the graph in one go when you call or .

The basic operation of machine learning is tensor dot product - the output of a neural network is the dot product of the input matrix and the network weights.

This enables you to quickly extract sub-components of the model.\n\nNote that the and models are not created with objects, but with the tensors that originate from objects. Under the hood, the layers and weights will be shared across these models, so that user can train the , and use or to do feature extraction. The inputs and outputs of the model can be nested structures of tensors as well, and the created models are standard Functional API models that support all the existing APIs.\n\nIn that case, you should define your layers in and you should implement the model's forward pass in .\n\nIf you subclass , you can optionally have a argument (boolean) in , which you can use to specify a different behavior in training and inference:\n\nOnce the model is created, you can config the model with losses and metrics with , train the model with , or use the model to do prediction with .\n\nIn addition, is a special case of model where the model is purely a stack of single-input, single-output layers.\n\nCompiles the model with the information given in config.\n\nThis method uses the information in the config (optimizer, loss, metrics, etc.) to compile the model.\n\nCompute the total loss, validate it, and return it.\n\nSubclasses can optionally override this method to provide custom loss computation logic.\n\nUpdate metric states and collect all metrics to be returned.\n\nSubclasses can optionally override this method to provide custom metric updating and collection logic.\n\nReturns the loss value & metrics values for the model in test mode.\n\nComputation is done in batches (see the arg.)\n\nThis method lets you export a model to a lightweight SavedModel artifact that contains the model's forward pass only (its method) and can be served via e.g. TF-Serving. The forward pass is registered under the name (see example below).\n\nThe original code of the model (including any custom layers you may have used) is no longer necessary to reload the artifact -- it is entirely standalone.\n\nIf you would like to customize your serving endpoints, you can use the lower-level class. The method relies on internally.\n\nTrains the model for a fixed number of epochs (dataset iterations).\n\nUnpacking behavior for iterator-like inputs: A common pattern is to pass an iterator like object such as a or a to , which will in fact yield not only features ( ) but optionally targets ( ) and sample weights ( ). Keras requires that the output of such iterator-likes be unambiguous. The iterator should return a tuple of length 1, 2, or 3, where the optional second and third elements will be used for and respectively. Any other type provided will be wrapped in a length-one tuple, effectively treating everything as . When yielding dicts, they should still adhere to the top-level tuple structure, e.g. . Keras will not attempt to separate features, targets, and weights from the keys of a single dict. A notable unsupported data type is the . The reason is that it behaves like both an ordered datatype (tuple) and a mapping datatype (dict). So given a namedtuple of the form: it is ambiguous whether to reverse the order of the elements when interpreting the value. Even worse is a tuple of the form: where it is unclear if the tuple was intended to be unpacked into , , and or passed through as a single element to .\n\nThis method is the reverse of , capable of instantiating the same layer from the config dictionary. It does not handle layer connectivity (handled by Network), nor weights (handled by ).\n\nReturns a serialized config with information for compiling the model.\n\nThis method returns a config dictionary containing all the information (optimizer, loss, metrics, etc.) with which the model was compiled.\n\nRetrieves a layer based on either its name (unique) or index.\n\nIf and are both provided, will take precedence. Indices are based on order of horizontal graph traversal (bottom-up).\n\nIf any of the metric result is a dict (containing multiple metrics), each of them gets added to the top level returned dict of this method.\n\nWeights are loaded based on the network's topology. This means the architecture should be the same as when the weights were saved. Note that layers that don't have weights are not taken into account in the topological ordering, so adding or removing layers is fine as long as they don't have weights.\n\nIf you have modified your model, for instance by adding a new layer (with weights) or by changing the shape of the weights of a layer, you can choose to ignore errors and continue loading by setting . In this case any layer with mismatching weights will be skipped. A warning will be displayed for each skipped layer.\n\nComputation is done in batches. This method is designed for batch processing of large numbers of inputs. It is not intended for use inside of loops that iterate over your data and process small numbers of inputs at a time.\n\nFor small numbers of inputs that fit in one batch, directly use for faster execution, e.g., , or if you have layers such as that behave differently during inference.\n\nNote that is an alias for .\n• The model's optimizer's state (if any)\n\nThus models can be reinstantiated in the exact same state.\n\nTest the model on a single batch of samples.\n\nTo load a network from a JSON save file, use ."

This article provides a quick summary of the content you’ll find there. If any of these topics interest you, head to the guide to learn more!There are many changes in TensorFlow 2.0 to make users more productive, including removing redundant APIs , making APIs more consistent ( Unified RNNs Unified Optimizers ), and better integrating with the Python runtime with Eager execution Many RFCs (check them out, if you’re new to them!) have explained the changes and thinking that have gone into making TensorFlow 2.0. This guide presents a vision for what development in TensorFlow 2.0 should look like. It’s assumed you have some familiarity with TensorFlow 1.x.Many APIs are either gone or moved in TF 2.0, and some have been replaced with their 2.0 equivalents —, and. The easiest way to automatically apply these renames is to use the v2 upgrade script TensorFlow 1.X requires users to manually stitch together an abstract syntax tree (the graph) by making tf.* API calls. It then requires users to manually compile the abstract syntax tree by passing a set of output tensors and input tensors to acall. By contrast, TensorFlow 2.0 executes eagerly (like Python normally does) and in 2.0, graphs and sessions should feel like implementation details.TensorFlow 1.X relied heavily on implicitly global namespaces. When you called, it would be put into the default graph, and it would remain there, even if you lost track of the Python variable pointing to it. You could then recover that, but only if you knew the name that it had been created with. This was difficult to do if you were not in control of the variable’s creation. As a result, all sorts of mechanisms proliferated to attempt to help users find their variables again.TensorFlow 2.0 eliminates all of these mechanisms ( Variables 2.0 RFC ) in favor of the default mechanism: Keep track of your variables! If you lose track of a, it gets garbage collected. See the guide for more details.call is almost like a function call: You specify the inputs and the function to be called, and you get back a set of outputs. In TensorFlow 2.0, you can decorate a Python function usingto mark it for JIT compilation so that TensorFlow runs it as a single graph ( Functions 2.0 RFC ).This mechanism allows TensorFlow 2.0 to gain all of the benefits of graph mode:With the power to freely intersperse Python and TensorFlow code, you can take full advantage of Python’s expressiveness. But portable TensorFlow executes in contexts without a Python interpreter — mobile, C++, and JS. To help users avoid having to rewrite their code when adding AutoGraph will convert a subset of Python constructs into their TensorFlow equivalents.\n\nSee the guide for more details.\n\nUse Keras layers and models to manage variables\n\nA common usage pattern in TensorFlow 1.X was the “kitchen sink” strategy, where the union of all possible computations was preemptively laid out, and then selected tensors were evaluated via. In TensorFlow 2.0, users should refactor their code into smaller functions which are called as needed. In general, it’s not necessary to decorate each of these smaller functions with; only useto decorate high-level computations — for example, one step of training, or the forward pass of your model.Keras models and layers offer the convenient variables and trainable_variables properties, which recursively gather up all dependent variables. This makes it easy to manage variables locally to where they are being used. Keras layers/models inherit fromand are integrated with, which makes it possible to directly checkpoint or export SavedModels from Keras objects. You do not necessarily have to useAPI to take advantage of these integrations.\n\nSee the guide for more details.\n\nTake advantage of AutoGraph with Python control flow\n\nWhen iterating over training data that fits in memory, feel free to use regular Python iteration. Otherwise,is the best way to stream training data from disk. Datasets are iterables (not iterators) , and work just like other Python iterables in Eager mode. You can fully utilize dataset async prefetching/streaming features by wrapping your code in, which replaces Python iteration with the equivalent graph operations using AutoGraph.If you use theAPI, you won’t have to worry about dataset iteration.AutoGraph provides a way to convert data-dependent control flow into graph-mode equivalents likeand\n\nOne common place where data-dependent control flow appears is in sequence models. wraps an RNN cell, allowing you to either statically or dynamically unroll the recurrence. For demonstration’s sake, you could reimplement dynamic unroll as follows:\n\nUse to aggregate data and to log it\n• What are Symbolic and Imperative APIs in TensorFlow 2.0?\n• Standardizing on Keras: Guidance on High-level APIs in TensorFlow 2.0\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nSee the guide for more details.Finally, a complete set ofsymbols are coming soon.

Let’s get started!\n\nOne of the first decisions you need to make when starting a machine learning or deep learning project is which framework to use. There are many frameworks available, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. However, two of the most popular and powerful frameworks are Keras and TensorFlow.\n\nKeras and TensorFlow are both open-source frameworks that allow you to create, train, and deploy machine learning and deep learning models. They are both developed and maintained by Google, and they are both compatible with Python, the most widely used programming language for machine learning and deep learning.\n\nBut what are the main differences between Keras and TensorFlow? And how do you choose the right framework for your needs and preferences? In this section, you will learn the answers to these questions, and you will also learn how to use Keras and TensorFlow together in TensorFlow 2.0, the latest version of TensorFlow.\n\nLet’s start by comparing Keras and TensorFlow in terms of their API, features, and performance.\n\nKeras and TensorFlow are both frameworks for building and deploying machine learning and deep learning models, but they have different levels of abstraction and flexibility. In this section, you will learn the main differences between Keras and TensorFlow in terms of their API, features, and performance.\n\nKeras is a high-level API that provides a simple and intuitive way to create and train models. It has a consistent and user-friendly interface that hides the complexity of the underlying TensorFlow operations. Keras allows you to define your model as a sequence or a graph of layers, and it handles the details of connecting the inputs and outputs, initializing the weights, and compiling the model. Keras also provides many built-in layers, losses, metrics, optimizers, callbacks, and utilities that make it easy to implement common models and tasks.\n\nTensorFlow is a low-level API that gives you more control and flexibility over your model. It allows you to define your model as a computational graph of tensors and operations, and it exposes the details of the underlying hardware and software. TensorFlow lets you customize every aspect of your model, such as the data types, shapes, gradients, and devices. TensorFlow also provides many advanced features, such as distributed training, eager execution, automatic differentiation, and tensorboard visualization.\n\nKeras and TensorFlow have different sets of features that cater to different needs and preferences. Here are some of the main features of each framework:\n• Keras:\n• Easy to use and learn\n• Supports multiple backends, such as TensorFlow, Theano, and CNTK\n• Supports multiple platforms, such as CPU, GPU, and TPU\n• Supports multiple modes of execution, such as eager and graph\n• Supports multiple formats of saving and loading models, such as HDF5, SavedModel, and ONNX\n• TensorFlow:\n• Supports multiple languages, such as Python, C++, Java, and Swift\n• Supports multiple frameworks, such as Keras, TensorFlow Probability, and TensorFlow Hub\n• Supports multiple tools, such as tensorboard, tfdbg, and tfprof\n• Supports multiple extensions, such as TensorFlow Lite, TensorFlow.js, and TensorFlow Serving\n\nKeras and TensorFlow have different trade-offs between performance and simplicity. Generally, Keras is faster and easier to use, but TensorFlow is more efficient and customizable.\n\nKeras is faster and easier to use because it has a higher level of abstraction and automation. It simplifies the model creation and training process, and it reduces the amount of code and configuration required. Keras also has a smaller learning curve and a larger community of users and resources. However, Keras may have some drawbacks in terms of performance, such as:\n• It may not support some complex or custom models and operations\n• It may not optimize some aspects of the model, such as memory usage and execution speed\n• It may not leverage some features of the backend, such as parallelism and distribution\n\nTensorFlow is more efficient and customizable because it has a lower level of abstraction and flexibility. It gives you more control and access to the model and the backend, and it allows you to fine-tune and modify every detail. TensorFlow also has a larger scope and a richer ecosystem of features and tools. However, TensorFlow may have some drawbacks in terms of simplicity, such as:\n• It may require more code and configuration to create and train a model\n• It may have a steeper learning curve and a smaller community of users and resources\n• It may have a higher risk of errors and bugs due to the complexity and variability\n\nTherefore, the choice between Keras and TensorFlow depends on your goals and preferences. If you want a simple and fast way to create and train a model, you may prefer Keras. If you want a more efficient and customizable way to create and train a model, you may prefer TensorFlow.\n\nBut what if you want the best of both worlds? Is there a way to use Keras and TensorFlow together? The answer is yes, and you will learn how in the next section.\n\nTensorFlow 2.0 is the latest version of TensorFlow, released in September 2019. It is a major update that brings many changes and improvements to the framework. One of the most significant changes is the integration of Keras as the default high-level API for TensorFlow. This means that you can use Keras and TensorFlow together seamlessly, and enjoy the benefits of both frameworks.\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to use Keras and TensorFlow 2.0 together, and what are the main advantages and features of this integration. You will also learn how to migrate your existing code from TensorFlow 1.x to TensorFlow 2.0, and how to troubleshoot some common issues and errors.\n\nHow to use Keras and TensorFlow 2.0 together\n\nUsing Keras and TensorFlow 2.0 together is very easy and straightforward. You just need to import the Keras modules from the tensorflow package, and use them as you normally would. For example, to create a simple model with Keras, you can use the following code:\n\nAs you can see, the code is very similar to the standard Keras code, except that you import the modules from the tensorflow package instead of the keras package. This ensures that you are using the Keras API that is integrated with TensorFlow 2.0, and not the standalone Keras package that may not be compatible with TensorFlow 2.0.\n\nWhat are the advantages and features of Keras and TensorFlow 2.0 integration\n\nUsing Keras and TensorFlow 2.0 together has many advantages and features that make it easier and more efficient to create and train models.

However, migrating from TensorFlow 1.x to TensorFlow 2.0 may not be trivial, as there are many changes and differences between the two versions. Here are some of the main changes and differences:\n• TensorFlow 2.0 uses eager execution as the default mode, while TensorFlow 1.x uses graph execution as the default mode.\n• TensorFlow 2.0 uses Keras as the default high-level API, while TensorFlow 1.x uses tf.layers, tf.losses, tf.metrics, and tf.estimator as the default high-level APIs.\n• TensorFlow 2.0 uses tf.function to convert Python functions into TensorFlow graphs, while TensorFlow 1.x uses tf.Session and tf.placeholder to run TensorFlow graphs.\n• TensorFlow 2.0 uses tf.keras.optimizers, tf.keras.metrics, and tf.keras.losses to define optimizers, metrics, and losses, while TensorFlow 1.x uses tf.train, tf.metrics, and tf.losses to define optimizers, metrics, and losses.\n• TensorFlow 2.0 uses tf.GradientTape to compute gradients, while TensorFlow 1.x uses tf.gradients to compute gradients.\n• TensorFlow 2.0 uses tf.Module and tf.Variable to define variables and modules, while TensorFlow 1.x uses tf.get_variable and tf.variable_scope to define variables and scopes.\n• TensorFlow 2.0 uses tf.data to handle data processing and loading, while TensorFlow 1.x uses tf.data, tf.placeholder, and tf.Queue to handle data processing and loading.\n• TensorFlow 2.0 uses tf.saved_model to save and load models, while TensorFlow 1.x uses tf.saved_model, tf.train.Saver, and tf.keras.models.save_model to save and load models.\n• TensorFlow 2.0 uses tf.lite and tf.js to convert and deploy models, while TensorFlow 1.x uses tf.contrib.lite and tfjs-converter to convert and deploy models.\n\nAs you can see, there are many changes and differences between TensorFlow 1.x and TensorFlow 2.0, and you may need to modify your code accordingly. However, TensorFlow 2.0 provides some tools and guides to help you with the migration process. Here are some of the tools and guides that you can use:\n• The TensorFlow 2.0 Upgrade Script is a script that automatically updates your code from TensorFlow 1.x to TensorFlow 2.0, by applying the necessary changes and fixes.\n• The TensorFlow 2.0 Migration Guide is a guide that explains the main changes and differences between TensorFlow 1.x and TensorFlow 2.0, and provides examples and tips on how to migrate your code manually.\n• The Effective TensorFlow 2.0 Guide is a guide that shows you how to use TensorFlow 2.0 effectively and efficiently, and provides best practices and recommendations on how to write and optimize your code.\n\nBy using these tools and guides, you will be able to migrate your code from TensorFlow 1.x to TensorFlow 2.0, and enjoy the benefits of the new version.\n\nHow to troubleshoot common issues and errors\n\nUsing Keras and TensorFlow 2.0 together may not always be smooth and error-free.

To fix this error, you need to install TensorFlow 2.0 using the following command:\n• None\n• AttributeError: module ‘tensorflow’ has no attribute ‘keras’: This error means that you have imported the standalone Keras package, instead of the Keras modules from the tensorflow package. To fix this error, you need to change your import statements from:\n• None\n• ValueError: No gradients provided for any variable: This error means that you have not defined any loss function for your model, or you have not passed any labels to your model. To fix this error, you need to define a loss function using the tf.keras.losses module, and pass the labels to your model using the y argument. For example:\n• None\n• TypeError: Input ‘y’ of ‘Mul’ Op has type float32 that does not match type int32 of argument ‘x’: This error means that you have passed labels of the wrong data type to your model. To fix this error, you need to convert your labels to the correct data type using the tf.cast function. For example, if your labels are integers, but your model expects floats, you can use the following code:\n\nData processing and loading are essential steps in any machine learning or deep learning project. They involve preparing and transforming the data into a suitable format for the model, and feeding the data to the model in an efficient and scalable way. However, data processing and loading can also be challenging and time-consuming, especially when dealing with large and complex datasets.\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to optimize data processing and loading with Keras and TensorFlow 2.0, and what are the main benefits and features of doing so.

They involve defining the architecture and the parameters of the model, and optimizing the model to fit the data and achieve the desired performance. However, building and training models can also be complex and challenging, especially when dealing with different types of models and tasks.\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to build and train models with Keras and TensorFlow 2.0, and what are the main benefits and features of doing so.

Let’s get started!\n\nKeras provides three different ways to create models: the Sequential API, the Functional API, and the Subclassing API. Each of these APIs has its own advantages and disadvantages, and they are suitable for different types of models and tasks. In this section, you will learn how to use each of these APIs to create models with Keras and TensorFlow 2.0, and what are the main differences and similarities between them.\n\nThe Sequential API is the simplest and most straightforward way to create models with Keras. It allows you to create models by stacking layers one after another, like a stack of pancakes. The Sequential API is ideal for creating simple models with a single input and a single output, such as feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks.\n\nTo use the Sequential API, you need to import the tf.keras.Sequential class and pass a list of layers to its constructor. For example, the following code creates a simple feedforward neural network with two hidden layers and one output layer:\n\nYou can also add layers to the model using the add method, like this:\n\nThe Sequential API has some limitations, such as:\n• It does not support models with multiple inputs or outputs\n• It does not support models with complex architectures, such as residual connections or branches\n• It does not support models with dynamic behavior, such as conditional layers or loops\n\nIf you need to create models with these features, you may want to use the Functional API or the Subclassing API instead.\n\nThe Functional API is a more flexible and powerful way to create models with Keras. It allows you to create models by connecting layers as a graph of nodes, like a flowchart. The Functional API is ideal for creating models with multiple inputs or outputs, or models with complex architectures, such as residual connections or branches.\n\nTo use the Functional API, you need to create instances of the layer classes and call them on the inputs or the outputs of other layers. For example, the following code creates a simple convolutional neural network with two inputs and one output:\n\nThe Functional API has some advantages over the Sequential API, such as:\n• It supports models with multiple inputs or outputs\n• It supports models with complex architectures, such as residual connections or branches\n• It supports models with shared layers, such as embedding layers or attention layers\n\nHowever, the Functional API also has some limitations, such as:\n• It does not support models with dynamic behavior, such as conditional layers or loops\n• It may be less intuitive and more verbose than the Sequential API\n• It may be harder to debug and troubleshoot than the Sequential API\n\nIf you need to create models with dynamic behavior, or if you prefer a more intuitive and concise way to create models, you may want to use the Subclassing API instead.\n\nThe Subclassing API is the most flexible and expressive way to create models with Keras. It allows you to create models by subclassing the tf.keras.Model class and defining your own forward pass logic. The Subclassing API is ideal for creating models with dynamic behavior, such as conditional layers or loops, or models with custom logic, such as custom training loops or custom gradients.\n\nTo use the Subclassing API, you need to create a class that inherits from the tf.keras.Model class and implement the __init__ and call methods. For example, the following code creates a simple recurrent neural network with one input and one output:\n\nThe Subclassing API has some advantages over the Functional and Sequential APIs, such as:\n• It supports models with dynamic behavior, such as conditional layers or loops\n• It supports models with custom logic, such as custom training loops or custom gradients\n• It is more intuitive and concise than the Functional API\n• It is easier to debug and troubleshoot than the Functional API\n\nHowever, the Subclassing API also has some disadvantages, such as:\n• It does not support some features of the Functional and Sequential APIs, such as model saving, loading, cloning, and summary\n• It may be less compatible and interoperable with other Keras and TensorFlow APIs and tools\n• It may be harder to ensure the correctness and reliability of the model\n\nTherefore, the choice between the Subclassing, Functional, and Sequential APIs depends on your goals and preferences. If you want a simple and fast way to create models, you may prefer the Sequential API. If you want a flexible and powerful way to create models, you may prefer the Functional API. If you want an expressive and dynamic way to create models, you may prefer the Subclassing API.\n\nNow that you know how to use the Keras Sequential, Functional, and Subclassing APIs to create models, you may wonder how to train and evaluate them. You will learn how in the next section.\n\nSometimes, you may need to create your own custom layers, losses, and metrics for your Keras and TensorFlow 2.0 models. This can be useful when you want to implement a specific functionality that is not available in the built-in modules, or when you want to customize the behavior of the existing modules. In this section, you will learn how to implement custom layers, losses, and metrics with Keras and TensorFlow 2.0, and what are the main benefits and challenges of doing so. You will learn how to:\n• Use the tf.keras.layers.Layer class to create custom layers, and implement the __init__, build, and call methods\n• Use the tf.keras.losses.Loss class to create custom losses, and implement the __init__ and call methods\n• Use the tf.keras.metrics.Metric class to create custom metrics, and implement the __init__, update_state, and result methods\n\nBy following these steps, you will be able to implement custom layers, losses, and metrics with Keras and TensorFlow 2.0, and enhance the functionality and flexibility of your models.\n\nAre you ready to implement custom layers, losses, and metrics? Let’s begin!\n\nPre-trained models and transfer learning are powerful techniques that can help you to improve the performance and efficiency of your Keras and TensorFlow 2.0 models. They involve using a model that has been trained on a large and relevant dataset, and applying it to a new task or dataset with minimal modifications.

Let’s dive in!\n\nHyperparameters are the parameters that are not learned by the model, but are set by the user before the training process. They include the number of units, the learning rate, the batch size, the activation function, the dropout rate, and many others. Hyperparameters can have a significant impact on the performance and efficiency of the model, but finding the optimal values for them can be challenging and time-consuming.\n\nKeras Tuner is a library that helps you to tune your hyperparameters with Keras and TensorFlow 2.0.
