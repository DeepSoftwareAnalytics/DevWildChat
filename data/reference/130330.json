A fragment has its own lifecycle, receives its own input events, and you can add or remove fragments while the containing activity is running.\n\nThis document describes how to create a fragment and include it in an activity.\n\nFragments require a dependency on the AndroidX Fragment library. You need to add the Google Maven repository to your project's file in order to include this dependency.\n\nTo include the AndroidX Fragment library to your project, add the following dependencies in your app's file:\n\nTo create a fragment, extend the AndroidX class, and override its methods to insert your app logic, similar to the way you would create an class. To create a minimal fragment that defines its own layout, provide your fragment's layout resource to the base constructor, as shown in the following example:\n\nThe Fragment library also provides more specialized fragment base classes:\n\nGenerally, your fragment must be embedded within an AndroidX to contribute a portion of UI to that activity's layout. is the base class for , so if you're already subclassing to provide backward compatibility in your app, then you do not need to change your activity base class.\n\nYou can add your fragment to the activity's view hierarchy either by defining the fragment in your activity's layout file or by defining a fragment container in your activity's layout file and then programmatically adding the fragment from within your activity. In either case, you need to add a that defines the location where the fragment should be placed within the activity's view hierarchy. It is strongly recommended to always use a as the container for fragments, as includes fixes specific to fragments that other view groups such as do not provide.\n\nTo declaratively add a fragment to your activity layout's XML, use a element.\n\nHere's an example activity layout containing a single :\n\nThe attribute specifies the class name of the to instantiate. When the activity's layout is inflated, the specified fragment is instantiated, is called on the newly instantiated fragment, and a is created to add the fragment to the .\n\nTo programmatically add a fragment to your activity's layout, the layout should include a to serve as a fragment container, as shown in the following example:\n\nUnlike the XML approach, the attribute isn't used on the here, so no specific fragment is automatically instantiated. Instead, a is used to instantiate a fragment and add it to the activity's layout.\n\nWhile your activity is running, you can make fragment transactions such as adding, removing, or replacing a fragment. In your , you can get an instance of the , which can be used to create a . Then, you can instantiate your fragment within your activity's method using , passing in the ID of the container in your layout and the fragment class you want to add and then commit the transaction, as shown in the following example:\n\nIn the previous example, note that the fragment transaction is only created when is .

        "document": "A represents a reusable portion of your app's UI. A fragment defines and manages its own layout, has its own lifecycle, and can handle its own input events. Fragments can't live on their own. They must be hosted by an activity or another fragment. The fragment’s view hierarchy becomes part of, or attaches to, the host’s view hierarchy.\n\nFragments introduce modularity and reusability into your activity’s UI by letting you divide the UI into discrete chunks. Activities are an ideal place to put global elements around your app's user interface, such as a navigation drawer. Conversely, fragments are better suited to define and manage the UI of a single screen or portion of a screen.\n\nConsider an app that responds to various screen sizes. On larger screens, you might want the app to display a static navigation drawer and a list in a grid layout. On smaller screens, you might want the app to display a bottom navigation bar and a list in a linear layout.\n\nManaging these variations in the activity is unwieldy. Separating the navigation elements from the content can make this process more manageable. The activity is then responsible for displaying the correct navigation UI, while the fragment displays the list with the proper layout.\n\nDividing your UI into fragments makes it easier to modify your activity's appearance at runtime. While your activity is in the lifecycle state or higher, fragments can be added, replaced, or removed. And you can keep a record of these changes in a back stack that is managed by the activity, so that the changes can be reversed.\n\nYou can use multiple instances of the same fragment class within the same activity, in multiple activities, or even as a child of another fragment. With this in mind, only provide a fragment with the logic necessary to manage its own UI. Avoid depending on or manipulating one fragment from another.\n\nFor more documentation and resources related to fragments, see the following.\n• Single Activity: Why, when, and how (Android Dev Summit '18)"

        "link": "https://developer.android.com/guide/fragments/lifecycle",
        "document": "Each instance has its own lifecycle. When a user navigates and interacts with your app, your fragments transition through various states in their lifecycle as they are added, removed, and enter or exit the screen.\n\nTo manage lifecycle, implements , exposing a object that you can access through the method.\n\nEach possible state is represented in the enum.\n\nBy building on top of , you can use the techniques and classes available for Handling Lifecycles with Lifecycle-Aware Components. For example, you might display the device's location on the screen using a lifecycle-aware component. This component could automatically start listening when the fragment becomes active and stop when the fragment moves to an inactive state.\n\nAs an alternative to using a , the class includes callback methods that correspond to each of the changes in a fragment's lifecycle. These include , , , , , and .\n\nA fragment's view has a separate that is managed independently from that of the fragment's . Fragments maintain a for their view, which can be accessed using or . Having access to the view's is useful for situations where a Lifecycle-aware component should only perform work while a fragment's view exists, such as observing that is only meant to be displayed on the screen.\n\nThis topic discusses the lifecycle in detail, explaining some of the rules that determine a fragment's lifecycle state and showing the relationship between the states and the fragment lifecycle callbacks.\n\nWhen a fragment is instantiated, it begins in the state. For a fragment to transition through the rest of its lifecycle, it must be added to a . The is responsible for determining what state its fragment should be in and then moving them into that state.\n\nBeyond the fragment lifecycle, is also responsible for attaching fragments to their host activity and detaching them when the fragment is no longer in use. The class has two callback methods, and , that you can override to perform work when either of these events occur.\n\nThe callback is invoked when the fragment has been added to a and is attached to its host activity. At this point, the fragment is active, and the is managing its lifecycle state. At this point, methods such as return this fragment.\n\nis always called before any Lifecycle state changes.\n\nThe callback is invoked when the fragment has been removed from a and is detached from its host activity. The fragment is no longer active and can no longer be retrieved using .\n\nis always called after any Lifecycle state changes.\n\nNote that these callbacks are unrelated to the methods and . For more information on these methods, see Fragment transactions.\n\nWhen determining a fragment's lifecycle state, considers the following:\n• A fragment's maximum state is determined by its . A fragment cannot progress beyond the state of its .\n• As part of a , you can set a maximum lifecycle state on a fragment using .\n• A fragment's lifecycle state can never be greater than its parent. For example, a parent fragment or activity must be started before its child fragments. Likewise, child fragments must be stopped before their parent fragment or activity.\n\nFigure 1 shows each of the fragment's states and how they relate to both the fragment's lifecycle callbacks and the fragment's view .\n\nAs a fragment progresses through its lifecycle, it moves upward and downward through its states. For example, a fragment that is added to the top of the back stack moves upward from to to . Conversely, when a fragment is popped off of the back stack, it moves downward through those states, going from to to and finally .\n\nWhen moving upward through its lifecycle states, a fragment first calls the associated lifecycle callback for its new state. Once this callback is finished, the relevant is emitted to observers by the fragment's , followed by the fragment's view , if it has been instantiated.\n\nWhen your fragment reaches the state, it has been added to a and the method has already been called.\n\nThis would be the appropriate place to restore any saved state associated with the fragment itself through the fragment's . Note that the fragment's view has not been created at this time, and any state associated with the fragment's view should be restored only after the view has been created.\n\nThis transition invokes the callback. The callback also receives a argument containing any state previously saved by . Note that has a value the first time the fragment is created, but it is always non-null for subsequent recreations, even if you do not override . See Saving state with fragments for more details.\n\nThe fragment's view is created only when your provides a valid instance. In most cases, you can use the fragment constructors that take a , which automatically inflates the view at the appropriate time. You can also override to programmatically inflate or create your fragment's view.\n\nIf and only if your fragment's view is instantiated with a non-null , that is set on the fragment and can be retrieved using . The is then updated with the newly corresponding with the fragment's view. The lifecycle callback is also called at this time.\n\nThis is the appropriate place to set up the initial state of your view, to start observing instances whose callbacks update the fragment's view, and to set up adapters on any or instances in your fragment's view.\n\nAfter the fragment's view has been created, the previous view state, if any, is restored, and the view's is then moved into the state. The view lifecycle owner also emits the event to its observers. Here you should restore any additional state associated with the fragment's view.\n\nThis transition also invokes the callback.\n\nIt is strongly recommended to tie Lifecycle-aware components to the state of a fragment, as this state guarantees that the fragment's view is available, if one was created, and that it is safe to perform a on the child of the fragment. If the fragment's view is non-null, the fragment's view is moved to immediately after the fragment's is moved to .\n\nWhen the fragment becomes , the callback is invoked.\n\nWhen the fragment is visible, all and effects have finished, and the fragment is ready for user interaction. The fragment's moves to the state, and the callback is invoked.\n\nThe transition to is the appropriate signal to indicate that the user is now able to interact with your fragment. Fragments that are not should not manually set focus on their views or attempt to handle input method visibility.\n\nWhen a fragment moves downward to a lower lifecycle state, the relevant is emitted to observers by the fragment's view , if instantiated, followed by the fragment's . After a fragment's lifecycle event is emitted, the fragment calls the associated lifecycle callback.\n\nAs the user begins to leave the fragment, and while the fragment is still visible, the s for the fragment and for its view are moved back to the state and emit the event to their observers. The fragment then invokes its callback.\n\nOnce the fragment is no longer visible, the s for the fragment and for its view are moved into the state and emit the event to their observers. This state transition is triggered not only by the parent activity or fragment being stopped, but also by the saving of state by the parent activity or fragment. This behavior guarantees that the event is invoked before the fragment's state is saved. This makes the event the last point where it is safe to perform a on the child .\n\nAs shown in figure 2, the ordering of the callback and the saving of the state with differs based on API level. For all API levels prior to API 28, is invoked before . For API levels 28 and higher, the calling order is reversed.\n\nAfter all of the exit animations and transitions have completed, and the fragment's view has been detached from the window, the fragment's view is moved into the state and emits the event to its observers. The fragment then invokes its callback. At this point, the fragment's view has reached the end of its lifecycle and returns a value.\n\nAt this point, all references to the fragment's view should be removed, allowing the fragment's view to be garbage collected.\n\nIf the fragment is removed, or if the is destroyed, the fragment's is moved into the state and sends the event to its observers. The fragment then invokes its callback. At this point, the fragment has reached the end of its lifecycle.\n\nFor more information related to the fragment lifecycle, see the following additional resources."

        "document": "Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.\n\nTo reuse fragments, build them as completely self-contained components that define their own layout and behavior. Once you define these reusable fragments, you can associate them with an activity and connect them with the application logic to realize the overall composite UI.\n\nTo properly react to user events and to share state information, you often need to have channels of communication between an activity and its fragments or between two or more fragments. To keep fragments self-contained, don't have fragments communicate directly with other fragments or with their host activity.\n\nThe library provides two options for communication: a shared and the Fragment Result API. The recommended option depends on the use case. To share persistent data with custom APIs, use a . For a one-time result with data that can be placed in a , use the Fragment Result API.\n\nThe following sections show you how to use and the Fragment Result API to communicate between your fragments and activities.\n\nis an ideal choice when you need to share data between multiple fragments or between fragments and their host activity. objects store and manage UI data. For more information about , see ViewModel overview.\n\nIn some cases, you might need to share data between fragments and their host activity. For example, you might want to toggle a global UI component based on an interaction within a fragment.\n\nConsider the following :\n\nIn this example, the stored data is wrapped in a class. is a lifecycle-aware observable data holder class. lets its value be changed. For more information about , see LiveData overview.\n\nBoth your fragment and its host activity can retrieve a shared instance of a with activity scope by passing the activity into the constructor. The handles instantiating the or retrieving it if it already exists. Both components can observe and modify this data.\n\nTwo or more fragments in the same activity often need to communicate with each other. For example, imagine one fragment that displays a list and another that lets the user apply various filters to the list. Implementing this case isn't trivial without the fragments communicating directly, but then they are no longer self-contained. Additionally, both fragments must handle the scenario where the other fragment is not yet created or visible.\n\nThese fragments can share a using their activity scope to handle this communication. By sharing the in this way, the fragments don't need to know about each other, and the activity doesn't need to do anything to facilitate the communication.\n\nThe following example shows how two fragments can use a shared to communicate:\n\nBoth fragments use their host activity as the scope for the . Because the fragments use the same scope, they receive the same instance of the , which enables them to communicate back and forth.\n\nWhen working with child fragments, your parent fragment and its child fragments might need to share data with each other. To share data between these fragments, use the parent fragment as the scope, as shown in the following example:\n\nIf you're using the Navigation library, you can also scope a to the lifecycle of a destination's . For example, the can be scoped to the for the :\n\nFor more information about scoping a to a , see Interact programmatically with the Navigation component.\n\nGet results using the Fragment Result API\n\nIn some cases, you might want to pass a one-time value between two fragments or between a fragment and its host activity. For example, you might have a fragment that reads QR codes, passing the data back to a previous fragment.\n\nIn Fragment version 1.3.0 and higher, each implements . This means that a can act as a central store for fragment results. This change lets components communicate with each other by setting fragment results and listening for those results, without requiring those components to have direct references to each other.\n\nTo pass data back to fragment A from fragment B, first set a result listener on fragment A, the fragment that receives the result. Call on fragment A's , as shown in the following example:\n\nIn fragment B, the fragment producing the result, set the result on the same by using the same . You can do so by using the API:\n\nFragment A then receives the result and executes the listener callback once the fragment is .\n\nYou can have only a single listener and result for a given key. If you call more than once for the same key, and if the listener is not , the system replaces any pending results with your updated result.\n\nIf you set a result without a corresponding listener to receive it, the result is stored in the until you set a listener with the same key. Once a listener receives a result and fires the callback, the result is cleared. This behavior has two major implications:\n• Fragments on the back stack do not receive results until they have been popped and are .\n• If a fragment listening for a result is when the result is set, the listener's callback then fires immediately.\n\nUse to test calls to and . Create a scenario for the fragment under test by using or , and then manually call the method that isn't being tested.\n\nTo test , create a scenario with the fragment that makes the call to .

        "document": "In the world of Mobile app development, data persistence is a fundamental aspect. Whether you are building a to-do list app, a note-taking app, or a complex e-commerce platform, the need to store and manage data efficiently arises in almost every application. SQLite, a lightweight and efficient relational database, is the go-to choice for many Android developers due to its simplicity and robustness.\n\nSQLite is an open-source relational database i.e. used to perform database operations on android devices such as storing, manipulating or retrieving persistent data from the database. It is embedded in android by default. So, there is no need to perform any database setup or administration task.\n\nThis article helps to provide a comprehensive guide to working with SQLite databases in Android development. We will cover the following topics:\n• Why Use SQLite in Android?\n\nSQLite is a self-contained, serverless, and transactional SQL database engine. It is embedded into the Android operating system, making it an ideal choice for local data storage in Android applications. SQLite databases are lightweight, efficient, and easy to use, making them a popular choice for developers.\n\n2. Why Use SQLite in Android?\n\nThere are several reasons why SQLite is a preferred choice for data storage in Android applications:\n• Lightweight: SQLite is designed to be lightweight and has a small footprint, making it suitable for mobile devices with limited resources.\n• Reliability: It is ACID compliant (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), ensuring data integrity and reliability.\n• Speed: SQLite operations are fast, and it provides efficient indexing mechanisms for quick data retrieval.\n• Compatibility: SQLite is built into the Android OS, so you don’t need to include additional libraries in your app.\n• No Network Dependency: Unlike client-server databases, SQLite doesn’t require a network connection, making it ideal for offline applications.\n\nTo start using SQLite in your Android project, follow these steps:\n• Create a Database Helper Class: Create a subclass of to manage database creation, version management, and connection.\n\n2. Initialize the Database: Open or create the database in your app’s method.\n\nTo create a SQLite database, you need to define its structure using SQL statements. Use the method of your subclass to execute these statements. Here's a simple example:\n\nSQLiteOpenHelper class provides the functionality to use the SQLite database.\n\nSQLite supports all the standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Here’s a brief overview:\n• Create: Use the statement to add new records to the database.\n• Read: Use the statement to retrieve data from the database.\n• Update: Use the statement to modify existing records.\n• Delete: Use the statement to remove records.\n\nThe class is used for database creation and version management. It helps you handle upgrades and downgrades of your database schema. For performing any database operation, you have to provide the implementation of onCreate() and onUpgrade() methods of SQLiteOpenHelper class.\n\nThere are two constructors of SQLiteOpenHelper class.\n\n→ SQLiteOpenHelper(Context context, String name, SQLiteDatabase.CursorFactory factory, int version) :- creates an object for creating, opening and managing the database.\n\n→ SQLiteOpenHelper(Context context, String name, SQLiteDatabase.CursorFactory factory, int version, DatabaseErrorHandler errorHandler) :- creates an object for creating, opening and managing the database. It specifies the error handler.\n• public abstract void onCreate(SQLiteDatabase db) :- called only once when database is created for the first time.\n• public abstract void onUpgrade(SQLiteDatabase db, int oldVersion, int newVersion) :- called when database needs to be upgraded.\n• public void onDowngrade(SQLiteDatabase db, int oldVersion, int newVersion) :- called when database needs to be downgraded.\n• Always use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.\n• Avoid opening and closing the database frequently; instead, use a singleton pattern for database access.\n• Handle database operations on a background thread to avoid blocking the UI thread.\n• Monitor and optimize database queries for performance using tools like Android Profiler.\n\nLet’s see the simple example of android sqlite database.\n\nNow, let’s create the database handler class that extends SQLiteOpenHelper class and provides the implementation of its methods.\n\npublic class DatabaseHandler extends SQLiteOpenHelper {\n\n private static final int DATABASE_VERSION = 1;\n\n private static final String DATABASE_NAME = \"studentlist\";\n\n private static final String TABLE_STUDENTS = \"students\";\n\n private static final String KEY_ID = \"id\";\n\n private static final String KEY_NAME = \"name\";\n\n\n\n public DatabaseHandler(Context context) {\n\n super(context, DATABASE_NAME, null, DATABASE_VERSION);\n\n //3rd argument to be passed is CursorFactory instance\n\n }\n\n\n\n // Creating Tables\n\n @Override\n\n public void onCreate(SQLiteDatabase db) {\n\n String CREATE_STUDENTS_TABLE = \"CREATE TABLE \" + TABLE_STUDENTS + \"(\"\n\n + KEY_ID + \" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\" \n\n + KEY_NAME + \" TEXT\"\n\n + \")\";\n\n db.execSQL(CREATE_STUDENTS_TABLE);\n\n }\n\n \n\n // Upgrading database\n\n @Override\n\n public void onUpgrade(SQLiteDatabase db, int oldVersion, int newVersion) {\n\n // Drop older table if existed\n\n db.execSQL(\"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS \" + TABLE_STUDENTS);\n\n\n\n // Create tables again\n\n onCreate(db);\n\n }\n\n\n\n // code to add the new student\n\n void addStudent(StudentList student) {\n\n SQLiteDatabase db = this.getWritableDatabase();\n\n\n\n ContentValues values = new ContentValues();\n\n values.put(KEY_NAME, student.getName()); // studentName\n\n\n\n // Inserting Row\n\n db.insert(TABLE_STUDENTS, null, values);\n\n //2nd argument is String containing nullColumnHack\n\n db.close(); // Closing database connection\n\n }\n\n\n\n // code to get the single student\n\n StudentList getStudent(int id) {\n\n SQLiteDatabase db = this.getReadableDatabase();\n\n\n\n Cursor cursor = db.query(TABLE_STUDENTS, \n\n new String[] { KEY_ID, KEY_NAME}, KEY_ID + \"=?\",\n\n new String[] { String.valueOf(id) }, \n\n null, null, null, null);\n\n if (cursor != null)\n\n cursor.moveToFirst();\n\n\n\n StudentList studentList = new StudentList(Integer.parseInt(cursor.getString(0)),\n\n cursor.getString(1), \n\n cursor.getString(2));\n\n // return studentList\n\n return studentList;\n\n }\n\n\n\n\n\n // code to get all student in a list view\n\n public List<StudentList> getAllStudentList() {\n\n List<StudentList> studentList = new ArrayList<StudentList>();\n\n // Select All Query\n\n String selectQuery = \"SELECT * FROM \" + TABLE_STUDENTS;\n\n\n\n SQLiteDatabase db = this.getWritableDatabase();\n\n Cursor cursor = db.rawQuery(selectQuery, null);\n\n\n\n // looping through all rows and adding to list\n\n if (cursor.moveToFirst()) {\n\n do {\n\n StudentList student = new StudentList();\n\n student.setID(Integer.parseInt(cursor.getString(0)));\n\n student.setName(cursor.getString(1));\n\n // Adding student to list\n\n studentList.add(student);\n\n } while (cursor.moveToNext());\n\n }\n\n\n\n // return student list\n\n return studentList;\n\n }\n\n\n\n // code to update the single student\n\n public int updateStudent(StudentList student) {\n\n SQLiteDatabase db = this.getWritableDatabase();\n\n\n\n ContentValues values = new ContentValues();\n\n values.put(KEY_NAME, student.getName());\n\n\n\n // updating row\n\n return db.update(TABLE_STUDENTS, values, KEY_ID + \" = ?\",\n\n new String[] { String.valueOf(student.getID()) });\n\n }\n\n\n\n\n\n // Deleting single student\n\n public void deleteStudent(StudentList student) {\n\n SQLiteDatabase db = this.getWritableDatabase();\n\n db.delete(TABLE_STUDENTS, KEY_ID + \" = ?\",\n\n new String[] { String.valueOf(student.getID()) });\n\n db.close();\n\n }\n\n\n\n\n\n // Getting student Count\n\n public int getStudentListCount() {\n\n String countQuery = \"SELECT * FROM \" + TABLE_STUDENTS;\n\n SQLiteDatabase db = this.getReadableDatabase();\n\n Cursor cursor = db.rawQuery(countQuery, null);\n\n cursor.close();\n\n\n\n // return count\n\n return cursor.getCount();\n\n }\n\n\n\n}\n\nIn the main activity of the app, call the function to initialize the DB\n\nSQLite is a powerful and reliable choice for managing local data storage in Android applications. Understanding how to create and manipulate SQLite databases is a valuable skill for any Android developer. By following the best practices outlined in this guide, you can ensure your Android apps perform efficiently and provide a seamless user experience.\n\nIncorporate SQLite into your Android projects, experiment with different database structures, and leverage the flexibility it offers to create data-driven applications that meet your users’ needs.

We should create a table and implement methods.\n\nIn the AndroidManifest.xml file you add permission to access the storage."

        "document": "Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.\n\nSaving data to a database is ideal for repeating or structured data, such as contact information. This page assumes that you are familiar with SQL databases in general and helps you get started with SQLite databases on Android. The APIs you'll need to use a database on Android are available in the package.\n\nCaution: Although these APIs are powerful, they are fairly low-level and require a great deal of time and effort to use:\n• There is no compile-time verification of raw SQL queries. As your data graph changes, you need to update the affected SQL queries manually. This process can be time consuming and error prone.\n• You need to use lots of boilerplate code to convert between SQL queries and data objects. For these reasons, we highly recommended using the Room Persistence Library as an abstraction layer for accessing information in your app's SQLite databases.\n\nOne of the main principles of SQL databases is the schema: a formal declaration of how the database is organized. The schema is reflected in the SQL statements that you use to create your database. You may find it helpful to create a companion class, known as a contract class, which explicitly specifies the layout of your schema in a systematic and self-documenting way.\n\nA contract class is a container for constants that define names for URIs, tables, and columns. The contract class allows you to use the same constants across all the other classes in the same package. This lets you change a column name in one place and have it propagate throughout your code.\n\nA good way to organize a contract class is to put definitions that are global to your whole database in the root level of the class. Then create an inner class for each table. Each inner class enumerates the corresponding table's columns.\n\nNote: By implementing the interface, your inner class can inherit a primary key field called that some Android classes such as expect it to have. It's not required, but this can help your database work harmoniously with the Android framework.\n\nFor example, the following contract defines the table name and column names for a single table representing an RSS feed:\n\nOnce you have defined how your database looks, you should implement methods that create and maintain the database and tables. Here are some typical statements that create and delete a table:\n\nJust like files that you save on the device's internal storage, Android stores your database in your app's private folder. Your data is secure, because by default this area is not accessible to other apps or the user.\n\nThe class contains a useful set of APIs for managing your database. When you use this class to obtain references to your database, the system performs the potentially long-running operations of creating and updating the database only when needed and not during app startup. All you need to do is call or .\n\nNote: Because they can be long-running, be sure that you call or in a background thread. See Threading on Android for more information.\n\nTo use , create a subclass that overrides the and callback methods. You may also want to implement the or methods, but they are not required.\n\nFor example, here's an implementation of that uses some of the commands shown above:\n\nTo access your database, instantiate your subclass of :\n\nInsert data into the database by passing a object to the method:\n\nThe first argument for is simply the table name.\n\nThe second argument tells the framework what to do in the event that the is empty (i.e., you did not any values). If you specify the name of a column, the framework inserts a row and sets the value of that column to null. If you specify , like in this code sample, the framework does not insert a row when there are no values.\n\nThe methods returns the ID for the newly created row, or it will return -1 if there was an error inserting the data. This can happen if you have a conflict with pre-existing data in the database.\n\nTo read from a database, use the method, passing it your selection criteria and desired columns. The method combines elements of and , except the column list defines the data you want to fetch (the \"projection\"), rather than the data to insert. The results of the query are returned to you in a object.\n\nThe third and fourth arguments ( and ) are combined to create a WHERE clause. Because the arguments are provided separately from the selection query, they are escaped before being combined. This makes your selection statements immune to SQL injection. For more detail about all arguments, see the reference.\n\nTo look at a row in the cursor, use one of the move methods, which you must always call before you begin reading values. Since the cursor starts at position -1, calling places the \"read position\" on the first entry in the results and returns whether or not the cursor is already past the last entry in the result set. For each row, you can read a column's value by calling one of the get methods, such as or . For each of the get methods, you must pass the index position of the column you desire, which you can get by calling or . When finished iterating through results, call on the cursor to release its resources. For example, the following shows how to get all the item IDs stored in a cursor and add them to a list:\n\nTo delete rows from a table, you need to provide selection criteria that identify the rows to the method. The mechanism works the same as the selection arguments to the method. It divides the selection specification into a selection clause and selection arguments. The clause defines the columns to look at, and also allows you to combine column tests. The arguments are values to test against that are bound into the clause. Because the result isn't handled the same as a regular SQL statement, it is immune to SQL injection.\n\nThe return value for the method indicates the number of rows that were deleted from the database.\n\nWhen you need to modify a subset of your database values, use the method.\n\nUpdating the table combines the syntax of with the syntax of .\n\nThe return value of the method is the number of rows affected in the database.\n\nSince and are expensive to call when the database is closed, you should leave your database connection open for as long as you possibly need to access it. Typically, it is optimal to close the database in the of the calling Activity.\n\nThe Android SDK includes a shell tool that allows you to browse table contents, run SQL commands, and perform other useful functions on SQLite databases. For more information, see how to how to issue shell commands."

Database operations are defined using the SQLiteOpenHelper:\n\nImportant Note: The SQLite database is lazily initialized. This means that it isn't actually created until it's first accessed through a call to or . This also means that any methods that call or should be done on a background thread as there is a possibility that they might be kicking off the initial creation of the database.\n\nOften a SQLite database will be used across your entire application; within services, applications, fragments, and more. For this reason, best practices often advise you to apply the singleton pattern to your instances to avoid memory leaks and unnecessary reallocations. The best solution is to make your database instance a singleton instance across the entire application's lifecycle.\n\nThe static method ensures that only one will ever exist at any given time. If the object has not been initialized, one will be created. If one has already been created then it will simply be returned. Then we can access our database connection with:\n\nSee this android design patterns article for more information.\n\nIn order to access our records from the database more easily, we should create a model class for each of our resources. In this case, let's define a and a model:\n\nNow we can interact with our data using the models.\n\nWe'll walk through examples of creating, reading, updating, and deleting posts / users in our database.\n\nIf you are inserting a large number of records, you might want to use a compiled SQLiteStatement . You can read more about the performance benefits on this blog\n\nWe can now leverage our database handler and models to persist data to our SQLite store:\n\nNote: In many cases, rather than interacting with SQL directly, Android apps can leverage one of the many available higher-level ORMs (object relational mappers) to persist Java models to a database table instead.\n\nThe full source code for the database handler above can be found here for reference:\n\nWhen working with SQLite, opening and inspecting the SQLite database can be helpful while debugging issues. You can leverage the Stetho library to view your data directly, or you can use the following command-line tools to retrieve the data.\n\nThe commands below will show how to get at the data (whether running on an emulator or an actual device). The commands should be performed within the terminal or command-line. Once you have the data, there are desktop SQLite viewers such as DB Browser for SQLite or SQLite Professional to help inspect the SQLite data graphically.\n\nUse to query the data on the emulator:\n\nFor further inspection, we can download the database file with:\n\nThere isn't a executable on the device so our only option is to download the database file with:\n\nYou can go to -> -> and look inside the and download the file locally. You can then use one of the previously mentioned SQLite desktop viewers."

        "document": "SQLite is an open-source relational database, similar to MySQL. Android includes a SQLite library in its standard library that implements a serverless, zero-configuration, and transactional SQL database engine. SQLite does not run on a database server, but stores all its data in simple files. A complete SQLite database with many tables, triggers, indices, and views is contained in a single disk file. SQLite is built into all mobile phones and most computers and comes bundled inside. It carries lightweight data and does not require any administration or setup procedure of the database.\n\nThe package android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase consists of all the APIs to perform CRUD operations from our android application.\n\nSQLiteOpenHelper is an in-built class of android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase package. It is a helper class to manage SQLite database creation and version management. The helper class manages the creation of the database, handling database manipulations, and also the version management. We need to create a subclass extending from SQLiteOpenHelper class for database manipulations. In this class, we will implement two overridden methods onCreate( ) and onUpgrade( ). These classes take care of opening the database if it exists, creating it if it does not, and upgrading it as necessary.\n\nThe onCreate( ) is called when the database is created for the first time. It is called only once throughout the entire application lifecycle. It will be called whenever there is a first call to getReadableDatabase( ) or getWritableDatabase( ) function. These functions are available in the super SQLiteOpenHelper class.\n\nThe below statement instantiates an object of the SQLiteOpenHelper class and calls its constructor.\n\nSQLiteOpenHelper class call the onCreate( ) method after creating database and instantiate SQLiteDatabase object. The onCreate( ) method is called only once when the database is created for the first time.\n\nThe onUpgrade( ) method is called when the database needs to be upgraded. It is called when the database file already exists, and we want to upgrade its version.\n\nNow we will create a simple Android application to demonstrate the SQLiteOPneHelper class. This application inserts employee records into a table 'Empdata' in a SQLite database 'Company.db' using the SQLiteOpenHelper class.\n\nWe have a very simple UI designed as below in the activity_main.xml\n\nWe can see that the DatabaseHelper class is extended from SQLiteOpenHelper. The SQLiteOpenHelper class has different in-built methods for inserting, updating, reading, and deleting records.\n\nAfter the database has been created we need to create and update fields. We can use a ContentValues object, which stores keys and values. ContentValues is a name-value pair, used to insert or update values into database tables. ContentValues object will be passed to SQLiteDataBase objects insert( ) and update( ) functions.\n\nDatabase Inspector allows us to inspect, query, and modify our app's databases while our app is running. The database inspector is available in Android Studio 4.1 and higher. This is especially useful for database debugging. The Database Inspector works with plain SQLite and with libraries built on top of SQLite, such as Room. The Database Inspector only works with the SQLite library included in the Android operating system on API level 26 and higher.\n\nTo open a database in the Database Inspector, do the following:\n• Run the app on an emulator or connected device running API level 26 or higher.\n• Select the running app process from the dropdown menu.\n• The databases in the currently running app appear in the Databases pane. Expand the node for the database that we need to inspect.\n\nNote: A known issue related to the Android 11 emulator causes apps to crash when connecting to the DB Inspector. To fix the issue, follow these steps."

        "document": "The others have already said that methods in onClick are searched in activities, not fragments. Nevertheless, if you really want it, it is possible.\n\nBasically, each view has a tag (probably null). We set the root view's tag to the fragment that inflated that view. Then, it is easy to search the view parents and retrieve the fragment containing the clicked button. Now, we find out the method name and use reflection to call the same method from the retrieved fragment. Easy!\n\nall activities are derived from the same ButtonHandlingActivity:\n\nIt has to define methods for all xml onClick handlers.\n\nAnd the next adventure will be proguard obfuscation...\n\nIt is of course up to you to design your application so that the data live in the Model rather than in Activities or Fragments (which are Controllers from the MVC, Model-View-Controller point of view). The View is what you define via xml, plus the custom view classes (if you define them, most people just reuse what already is). A rule of thumb: if some data definitely must survive the screen turn, they belong to Model."

I tried just adding a regular listener in the fragment's with the ID of the buttons but it's (expectedly) giving me a null pointer exception.\n\nI do know of the method of doing this but it would probably take a good many hours of manual refactoring to achieve what I need (at least from what I can tell about its usage, I'd be happy to be wrong), so I was wondering if anyone knows of any other method to get this done in a non-repetitive way."
