        "document": "How to use a pipe\n\nA pipe is a system call that creates a unidirectional communication link between two file descriptors. The pipe system call is called with a pointer to an array of two integers. Upon return, the first element of the array contains the file descriptor that corresponds to the output of the pipe (stuff to be read). The second element of the array contains the file descriptor that corresponds to the input of the pipe (the place where you write stuff). Whatever bytes are sent into the input of the pipe can be read from the other end of the pipe.\n\nThis is a small program that gives an example of how a pipe works. The array of two file descriptors is . Whatever is written to will be read from .\n\n#include <stdlib.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <string.h> int main(int argc, char **argv) { int n; int fd[2]; char buf[1025]; char *data = \"hello... this is sample data\"; pipe(fd); write(fd[1], data, strlen(data)); if ((n = read(fd[0], buf, 1024)) >= 0) { buf[n] = 0; printf(\"read %d bytes from the pipe: \\\"%s\\\"\n\n\", n, buf); } else perror(\"read\"); exit(0); }\n\nSave this file by control-clicking or right clicking the download link and then saving it as .\n\nIf you don't have gcc, You may need to substitute the gcc command with cc or another name of your compiler.\n\nThis next example shows the true value of a pipe. We create a pipe between the \"/bin/ls -al /\" command and the \"/usr/bin/tr a-z A-Z\" command. This is the equivalent of running the shell command:\n\nThe first command generates a long-format directory listing of the root ( ) directory and the second command takes that listing and translates all lowercase characters to uppercase.\n\nWe start off by creating a pipe. Then we fork a child process. The parent will use the pipe for command output. That means it needs to change its standard output file descriptor (1) to the writing end of the pipe ( ). It does this via the dup2 system call: . Then it executes the command in .\n\nThe child will use the pipe for command input. It needs to change its standard input file descriptor (0) to the reading end of the pipe ( ). It also does this via the dup2 system call: . Then it executes the command in .\n\nSave this file by control-clicking or right clicking the download link and then saving it as .\n\nIf you don't have gcc, You may need to substitute the gcc command with cc or another name of your compiler.\n\nThe above example put the parent process into a state where it gave up its standard output to the pipe and the process itself was replaced by the exec of . If we want to preserve the parent program and its input and output streams but run the pipe between two child processes, we need to fork off two children.\n\nThe child that generates output will set its standard output to the writing end of the pipe and the child that consumes that data will set its standard input to the reading end of the same pipe. Once this is done the parent no longer needs the pipe and can close its file descriptors. This is important! If the parent does not close the writing end of the pipe ( ) then the child that is reading from the pipe will never read an end of file and will never exit.\n\nSave this file by control-clicking or right clicking the download link and then saving it as .\n\nIf you don't have gcc, You may need to substitute the gcc command with cc or another name of your compiler."

        "document": "Pipe is a communication medium between two or more related or interrelated processes. It can be either within one process or a communication between the child and the parent processes. Communication can also be multi-level such as communication between the parent, the child and the grand-child, etc. Communication is achieved by one process writing into the pipe and other reading from the pipe. To achieve the pipe system call, create two files, one to write into the file and another to read from the file.\n\nPipe mechanism can be viewed with a real-time scenario such as filling water with the pipe into some container, say a bucket, and someone retrieving it, say with a mug. The filling process is nothing but writing into the pipe and the reading process is nothing but retrieving from the pipe. This implies that one output (water) is input for the other (bucket).\n\nThis system call would create a pipe for one-way communication i.e., it creates two descriptors, first one is connected to read from the pipe and other one is connected to write into the pipe.\n\nDescriptor pipedes[0] is for reading and pipedes[1] is for writing. Whatever is written into pipedes[1] can be read from pipedes[0].\n\nThis call would return zero on success and -1 in case of failure. To know the cause of failure, check with errno variable or perror() function.\n\nEven though the basic operations for file are read and write, it is essential to open the file before performing the operations and closing the file after completion of the required operations. Usually, by default, 3 descriptors opened for every process, which are used for input (standard input stdin), output (standard output stdout) and error (standard error stderr) having file descriptors 0, 1 and 2 respectively.\n\nThis system call would return a file descriptor used for further file operations of read/write/seek (lseek). Usually file descriptors start from 3 and increase by one number as the number of files open.\n\nThe arguments passed to open system call are pathname (relative or absolute path), flags mentioning the purpose of opening file (say, opening for read, O_RDONLY, to write, O_WRONLY, to read and write, O_RDWR, to append to the existing file O_APPEND, to create file, if not exists with O_CREAT and so on) and the required mode providing permissions of read/write/execute for user or owner/group/others. Mode can be mentioned with symbols.\n\nFor example: Octal value (starts with 0), 0764 implies owner has read, write and execute permissions, group has read and write permissions, other has read permissions. This can also be represented as S_IRWXU | S_IRGRP | S_IWGRP | S_IROTH, which implies or operation of 0700|0040|0020|0004 → 0764.\n\nThis system call, on success, returns the new file descriptor id and -1 in case of error. The cause of error can be identified with errno variable or perror() function.\n\nThe above system call closing already opened file descriptor. This implies the file is no longer in use and resources associated can be reused by any other process. This system call returns zero on success and -1 in case of error. The cause of error can be identified with errno variable or perror() function.\n\nThe above system call is to read from the specified file with arguments of file descriptor fd, proper buffer with allocated memory (either static or dynamic) and the size of buffer.\n\nThe file descriptor id is to identify the respective file, which is returned after calling open() or pipe() system call. The file needs to be opened before reading from the file. It automatically opens in case of calling pipe() system call.\n\nThis call would return the number of bytes read (or zero in case of encountering the end of the file) on success and -1 in case of failure. The return bytes can be smaller than the number of bytes requested, just in case no data is available or file is closed. Proper error number is set in case of failure.\n\nTo know the cause of failure, check with errno variable or perror() function.\n\nThe above system call is to write to the specified file with arguments of the file descriptor fd, a proper buffer with allocated memory (either static or dynamic) and the size of buffer.\n\nThe file descriptor id is to identify the respective file, which is returned after calling open() or pipe() system call.\n\nThe file needs to be opened before writing to the file. It automatically opens in case of calling pipe() system call.\n\nThis call would return the number of bytes written (or zero in case nothing is written) on success and -1 in case of failure. Proper error number is set in case of failure.\n\nTo know the cause of failure, check with errno variable or perror() function.\n\nFollowing are some example programs.\n\nExample program 1 − Program to write and read two messages using pipe.\n\nStep 3 − Retrieve the message from the pipe and write it to the standard output.\n\nStep 4 − Send another message to the pipe.\n\nStep 5 − Retrieve the message from the pipe and write it to the standard output.\n\nNote − Retrieving messages can also be done after sending all messages.\n\nNote − Ideally, return status needs to be checked for every system call. To simplify the process, checks are not done for all the calls.\n\nExample program 2 − Program to write and read two messages through the pipe using the parent and the child processes.\n\nStep 4 − Child process retrieves the message from the pipe and writes it to the standard output.\n\nStep 5 − Repeat step 3 and step 4 once again.\n\nPipe communication is viewed as only one-way communication i.e., either the parent process writes and the child process reads or vice-versa but not both. However, what if both the parent and the child needs to write and read from the pipes simultaneously, the solution is a two-way communication using pipes. Two pipes are required to establish two-way communication.\n\nFollowing are the steps to achieve two-way communication −\n\nStep 1 − Create two pipes. First one is for the parent to write and child to read, say as pipe1. Second one is for the child to write and parent to read, say as pipe2.\n\nStep 3 − Close unwanted ends as only one end is needed for each communication.\n\nStep 4 − Close unwanted ends in the parent process, read end of pipe1 and write end of pipe2.\n\nStep 5 − Close the unwanted ends in the child process, write end of pipe1 and read end of pipe2.\n\nStep 1 − Create pipe1 for the parent process to write and the child process to read.\n\nStep 2 − Create pipe2 for the child process to write and the parent process to read.\n\nStep 3 − Close the unwanted ends of the pipe from the parent and child side.\n\nStep 4 − Parent process to write a message and child process to read and display on the screen.\n\nStep 5 − Child process to write a message and parent process to read and display on the screen."

        "document": "Named Pipe or FIFO with example C program\n\nIn computing, a named pipe, also known as a FIFO (First In, First Out), is a powerful mechanism for inter-process communication (IPC). Unlike unnamed pipes, which are temporary and exist only as long as the process that created them is running, named pipes provide a persistent communication channel between processes, surviving beyond the life of the process that created them. This makes named pipes an essential tool for developers who need processes to exchange data reliably and efficiently.\n\nA named pipe is an extension of the traditional pipe concept in Unix. While a traditional pipe is “unnamed” and exists only temporarily, a named pipe can persist as long as the system is up or until it is explicitly deleted. Named pipes appear as special files in the filesystem, and multiple processes can attach to them for reading and writing, facilitating inter-process communication.\n\nA FIFO file allows two or more processes to communicate by reading from and writing to the same file. This file type is created using the ‘mkfifo()’ system call in C. Once created, any process can open the named pipe for reading or writing, similar to how it would handle an ordinary file. However, it is important to note that a named pipe must be opened simultaneously at both ends (for reading and writing) before any input or output operations can occur.\n\nHow to Create a Named Pipe (FIFO) in Unix\n\nTo create a FIFO special file, you use the ‘mkfifo()’ function in C. The function creates a named pipe with the specified pathname and permissions.\n\n\n\n‘mkfifo()’ makes a FIFO special file with name pathname. Here ‘mode’ specifies the FIFO’s permissions. It is modified by the process’s umask in the usual way: the permissions of the created file are (mode & ~umask).\n\nUsing FIFO: As named pipe(FIFO) is a kind of file, we can use all the system calls associated with it i.e. open, read, write, close.\n\nExample Programs to illustrate the named pipe: There are two programs that use the same FIFO. Program 1 writes first, then reads. The program 2 reads first, then writes. They both keep doing it until terminated.\n\n\n\nOutput: Run the two programs simultaneously on two terminals.\n\n\n\nThe Named pipes (FIFOs) are a robust method for the inter-process communication allowing data to be passed between the processes using a named file. This mechanism is useful in the scenarios where processes need to exchange data without direct knowledge of the each other. The example demonstrates a simple producer-consumer model where one process writes data to a FIFO and another reads it showcasing the basic usage of the named pipes in C.\n\nNamed Pipe or FIFO with Example C Program – FAQs\n\nWhat is the primary difference between a named pipe and an unnamed pipe?\n\nHow do I handle errors when working with FIFOs?\n\nCan multiple processes write to or read from the same FIFO?"
