        "document": "Edge computing can complement a hybrid computing model, and can specifically be used for:\n• Several stages of the artificial intelligence/machine learning lifecycle - such as gathering data, deploying apps into production, making inferences and monitoring the operation as new data is collected.\n\nOne of the major benefits of edge computing is its ability to optimize resources. If an issue needs to be addressed, only the necessary services and functionality are deployed, which decreases bandwidth usage and costs. Furthermore, if a device loses connection to the core datacenter or cloud, it will continue to operate and maintain remote resiliency.\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the process of connecting everyday physical objects to the internet—from common household objects like lightbulbs; to healthcare assets like medical devices; to wearables, smart devices, and even smart cities.\n\nIoT devices aren’t necessarily edge devices. But these connected devices are part of many organizations’ edge strategies. Edge computing can bring more compute power to the edges of an IoT-enabled network to reduce the latency of communication between IoT-enabled devices and the central IT networks those devices are connected to.\n\nSimply sending or receiving data is what marked the advent of IoT. But sending, receiving, and analyzing data together with IoT applications is a more modern approach made possible by edge computing.\n\nWhen problems arise in mobile computing, they often revolve around latency issues and service failures. Edge computing can help solve for stringent latency constraints by reducing signal propagation delays. Additionally, it can limit service failures to a smaller area or user population, or provide a degree of service continuity despite intermittent network connectivity.\n\nAs service providers modernize their networks, they are moving workloads and services out of the core network (in datacenters) towards the network’s edge: around points of presence and central offices. With the virtualization of central offices, one of the last physical interfaces for service delivery, service providers can reach the goal of deploying services at the network edge."

        "document": "In recent years, the world of computing has witnessed a significant shift from traditional cloud computing to a paradigm known as “edge computing.” This transformation has been driven by the need for faster processing, real-time analysis, and decision-making capabilities in various industries. Edge computing is crucial for managing the data generated by connected devices and reducing strain on internet bandwidth and latency. Edge computing complements and enhances cloud capabilities by bringing computation and data storage closer to the source of data generation, resulting in reduced latency and improved response times. We will delve into the concept of edge computing, its importance, architecture, benefits, and real-world applications. We will also explore how the edge computing solutions developed by Acumera can empower businesses in this evolving landscape.\n\nEdge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings data processing and computation closer to the data source, reducing the latency between data generation and analysis. Unlike traditional cloud computing, where data is processed in a central data center, edge computing leverages devices such as routers, gateways, and IoT devices to perform computations locally.\n\nEdge computing complements cloud computing by extending its capabilities to the edge of the network. Edge-to-cloud computing enhances traditional centralized cloud computing by addressing challenges such as latency and bandwidth, processing data closer to its source. While cloud computing is ideal for processing and storing large volumes of data, edge computing is designed for real-time, low-latency processing. This synergy allows businesses to harness the benefits of both paradigms, enabling them to make faster decisions and improve overall efficiency. Additionally, evaluating strategies and technologies for edge deployments is crucial for ensuring performance, interoperability, and resilience.\n\nEdge devices play a crucial role in edge computing by deploying computing and storage resources at the network edge, in close proximity to data sources. These devices, including routers, gateways, and IoT devices, collect and process data at the edge of the network. They act as intermediaries between the data source and the cloud, filtering and analyzing data before transmitting only relevant information to centralized data centers. Additionally, edge servers play a critical role in enhancing the performance of online and cloud utilization by minimizing lag and latency, significantly improving the overall customer experience.\n\nRouters and gateways are both network devices, but they serve different purposes and have distinct functions within a network. Routers are primarily responsible for routing data packets between different networks based on IP addresses, while gateways serve as intermediaries between networks with differing protocols, translating data to ensure compatibility between the networks. The choice between using a router or a gateway depends on the specific networking requirements and the need for protocol translation within the network infrastructure. When combined with cloud computing, edge computing creates a powerful and flexible computing ecosystem that can address a wide range of application requirements in a connected world.\n\nEdge computing holds immense significance in the modern technology landscape due to several compelling reasons:\n\n\n\nEdge computing is important because it enables decentralized computing, which is critical for managing the vast amounts of data generated by modern applications. It facilitates faster, real-time data processing and mitigates network issues like bandwidth limitations and latency, making it essential for time-sensitive operations such as those in self-driving cars. Additionally, edge computing use cases demonstrate practical applications where data is collected and processed at or near the network edge, addressing challenges related to cost, technology limitations, and compliance issues.\n\nOne of the primary reasons for the rise of edge computing is its ability to enable faster processing and real-time analysis. By processing data locally at the edge, businesses can make instant decisions, leading to improved operational efficiency and enhanced user experiences.\n\nOne example of this is enhanced employee productivity, edge computing enables delivering the data employees need to do their jobs as efficiently as possible, and by keeping the equipment they use running smoothly without interruption.\n\nEdge computing has the potential to transform businesses across every industry and function. Smart devices, along with edge computing, facilitate real-time monitoring, data processing, and automation to improve safety, productivity, and responsiveness. Whether it’s autonomous vehicles, hospitality, retail, healthcare, or industrial IoT, edge computing is driving innovation and revolutionizing how data is managed and utilized.\n\nImagine how collecting data from remote or inhospitable environments creates timely and actionable insights; whether it is data from underground fuel storage tanks that alert when the level is dropping unexpectedly, or a sensor on a freezer alerting a restaurateur that the temperature is rising.\n\nEdge computing is instrumental in supporting emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT). AI algorithms can run locally on edge devices, providing real-time insights, while IoT devices can transmit data more efficiently, thanks to edge processing. In retail, AI is making great strides with edge computing in many areas. One common use case is providing store attendants the data they need to give instant recommendations based on a customer’s browsing and purchase history.\n\nThe implementation of edge computing involves deploying edge devices strategically within a network.

It offers low latency and real-time capabilities, making it suitable for applications that require quick decision-making.\n\nCloud computing relies on centralized data centers for data processing and storage. It excels at handling large-scale data and batch processing but may introduce latency for time-sensitive applications.\n\nFog computing is an intermediate approach that combines edge and cloud computing. It leverages edge devices to perform preliminary data processing, reducing the load on centralized data centers.\n\nBy processing data at the edge, edge computing significantly reduces latency, ensuring faster response times for critical applications.\n\nLocal processing at the edge enhances security and privacy by minimizing the exposure of sensitive data to external networks.\n\nEdge computing reduces bandwidth requirements, resulting in cost savings for data transmission and storage.

But exactly what is edge computing and why is edge computing important? Edge computing brings processing power closer to the source of data, rather than sending it to a centralized location. As the world becomes more connected and the amount of data generated continues to grow, edge computing is poised to play an increasingly important role in shaping the future of technology. This blog provides an introduction to edge computing, the benefits of edge computing and some examples on industry applications of edge computing.\n\nEdge computing refers to the practice of processing data closer to where it is generated, rather than sending it to a central location for processing. This means that data is processed in real time, without the need for a high-speed internet connection. Increasingly, the proliferation of connected, Internet of Things (IoT) devices is why edge computing is important. With so much data being generated by these devices, it’s not practical to send all the data to a central location for processing. Edge computing allows for faster, more efficient processing of data, which in turn can lead to better decision-making and improved performance.\n\nEdge computing works by using mainly small, low-power devices called “edge devices.” These edge devices are located close to data sources and connected to a network, which allows them to communicate with each other and with the cloud. When data is generated, it’s processed by an edge device, which can then send the processed data to the cloud for further analysis. This process is much faster than sending all of the data to the cloud for processing, which can take a long time and require a lot of bandwidth. Edge computing will not replace cloud computing. Rather, edge computing aims to push some of the cloud’s processing power and storage capacity closer to devices that produce and consume the data. Therefore it extends today’s cloud capabilities to a seamless hybrid computing environment.\n\nAs we explore the possibilities that edge computing offers the world by bringing data storage and processing power closer to data source devices, one possibility includes multi-access edge computing (MEC). Multi-access edge computing is a specific implementation of edge computing for wireless communication networks, such as 4G or 5G. Multi-access edge computing focuses on deploying edge computing capabilities at base stations or access points, enhancing network performance and delivering low-latency services to wireless communication users. Such implementation concepts, like the MEC for telecommunications, play more and more a significant role in various industries, including healthcare, transportation and smart cities. Thereby it enables new edge-based services and applications, such as video analytics for real-time surveillance, low-latency analytic services or intelligent autonomous logistics.\n\nWhat are the benefits of edge computing?\n\nOne of the biggest benefits of edge computing is its ability to reduce latency. By processing data closer to the source, edge computing can significantly reduce the time it takes to transmit data to the cloud. With edge computing, data is processed locally on devices or servers at the edge of the network, rather than being sent to a central data center for processing. This means that data can be processed in real time, without the latency that comes with sending data back and forth to a central location. This is particularly important for businesses that rely on real-time data analysis, such as those in the healthcare and finance industries, as well as applications that require real-time data processing, such as autonomous vehicles and industrial automation.\n\nAnother benefit of edge computing is its ability to enhance security, because sensitive data can be processed and stored locally instead of being sent to a central location where it may be more vulnerable to cyber attacks. By processing data locally, edge computing can reduce the risk of data breaches and cyber attacks.\n\nAdditionally, edge computing can help businesses reduce network congestion and bandwidth costs by reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted over the network and to the cloud.\n\nEdge computing is a powerful technology and a compelling option for businesses looking to improve their data processing capabilities. Take advantage of three key benefits that edge computing offers:\n\nOverall, edge computing is a useful technology for optimizing web apps and connected devices by securely minimizing bandwidth usage and latency.

As more and more devices are connected to the internet, the risk of cyber attacks increases and the importance of cyber security for businesses cannot be underestimated. Edge computing has the potential to reduce the strain on network infrastructure and improve security by keeping sensitive data closer to the source. Edge computing, which involves processing data closer to the source rather than in a centralized location, can help mitigate some of these risks by reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted over the internet.\n\nHowever, to implement edge computing, it is important to ensure that edge devices and networks are secure through measures such as encryption, access controls and regular software and firmware updates. Additionally, it is important to have a plan in place for responding to security incidents, as well as to regularly test and evaluate the security of edge computing systems. By taking these steps, organizations can harness the powerful benefits of edge computing while minimizing cyber security risks.\n\nEdge computing has the potential to improve sustainability across every industry.
