        "document": "A watermark is a piece of text or an image that appears behind the document content. You can add a watermark to a Word document to inform other people about the document’s copyright or proprietary information. In this article, I will demonstrate how to add or remove watermarks in Word documents using C# and VB.NET.\n\nThe following topics will be discussed:\n\nTo add or remove watermarks in Word documents, this article uses Free Spire.Doc for .NET. You can download the DLL file of the API from this website or install it via NuGet by selecting Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console and then execute the following command:\n\nAdd a Text Watermark to a Word Document using C# and VB.NET\n\nIn Free Spire.Doc, a text watermark is represented by an instance of TextWatermark class. To add a text watermark to a Word document, you need to create an instance of TextWatermark class, then set text, font, and layout properties for the text watermark, after that assign the TextWatermark instance to the Document.Watermark property.\n\nThe following steps describe how to add a text watermark to a Word document:\n• Set text, font size, font color, and layout properties for the text watermark.\n• Add the text watermark to the document by assigning the TextWatermark instance to Document.Watermark property.\n\nAdd an Image Watermark to a Word Document using C# and VB.NET\n\nAn image watermark is represented by an instance of PictureWatermark class. To add an image watermark to a Word document, you need to create an instance of PictureWatermark class, then set image, scaling, and washout properties for the image watermark, after that assign the PictureWatermark instance to the Document.Watermark property.\n\nThe following steps show you how to add an image watermark to a Word document:\n• Set image, scaling, and washout properties for the image watermark.\n• Add the image watermark to the document by assigning the PictureWatermark instance to Document.Watermark property.\n\nRemove Text or Image Watermark from a Word Document using C# and VB.NET\n\nRemoving a watermark from a Word document is extremely easy with Free Spire.Doc for .NET. You just need to set the Document.Watermark property as null.\n\nThe following steps show you how to remove a watermark from a Word document:\n• Remove the watermark from the document by setting the Document.Watermark property as null."

I've followed an example posted here and I've gotten the code to the point where it will add the watermark if the header already exists.\n\nThe current issue is when I add a new header, add the reference to the document, and then add the watermark to the header, the document becomes corrupt and can no longer open in Word 2010.\n\nTo test I've been doing the following: Create a new word document from word itself with text of \"TestDoc\" in the main part of the page. Save to my desktop as \"TestDoc.docx\" and close the file. Then I run the app from Visual Studio. The code below will always make it corrupted. If I add a header to the file with no text in it and then hit save, the watermark will be displayed correctly.\n\nHere is what I have so far:\n\nThis is now resolved by changing the way the file is opened up. When we change the Main function to:\n\nThe document now correctly opens in word. Thanks Brad!"

I've searched around and the only example that I was able to find is when the watermark is added to the header of the document, like here.\n\nThis won't work for me, because the document already has text in the header, and it must be preserved. The example actually replaces the Header section with a new one that contains the watermark image.\n\nAnother challenge is to add the watermark in the body of the document, and behind or in front of the document, so that the content of the body remains readable. I've read an example in which the watermark is added after the content and there were issues if the content contained images.\n\nAny guidance would be appreciated."

        "document": "I want to add watermark Using C#. And I expect this solution. first the watermark should be added as a watermark object rather than a shape in the header. And Watermark add to all pages of word file. The second watermark should be editable and when I edit the watermark Manually in Wordfile, the watermark should change in all pages of the wordfile.\n\nFor More Information I Use This code.....\n\nusing System;\n\nusing Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word;\n\n// Set the position and properties of the watermark\n\nwatermark.WrapFormat.AllowOverlap = -1; // Allow overlap\n\nwatermark.Left = (float)(doc.PageSetup.PageWidth / 2) - (watermark.Width / 2);\n\nwatermark.Top = (float)(doc.PageSetup.PageHeight / 2) - (watermark.Height / 2);\n\nwatermark.Fill.Transparency = 0.5f; // Set transparency\n\nwatermark.TextEffect.NormalizedHeight = false;\n\n}\n\ndoc.Save();\n\ndoc.Close();\n\nwordApp.Quit();\n\n}\n\n}\n\nIssue:-Add watermark to wordfile using this code which is good. But when the watermark is added using this code we open the created word file and click on the header to edit the watermark there is an option to remove the header in the header menu. When we click on the RemoveHeader option the watermark is also removed. It means that the watermark added to the header is not valid because it has been removed. Watermark like when we manually add it to word file from design menu is not added to header which is ok. And if we remove the header, the watermark is not removed because it is not added to the header. I want to add watermark like this by coding. So if the header is removed the watermark will not be removed. And second point watermarks should be editable. So if someone makes a change, it should be changed in all the pages of the word file."

        "document": "A watermark is a faded background image or text displayed behind document content. The Word Processing Document API allows you to create and remove watermarks in DOCX, DOC, and RTF documents. You can also print and export documents with watermarks to PDF.\n\nThe Word Processing Document API ships with the WatermarkManager interface that allows you to insert and remove text and image watermarks. Use the Document.WatermarkManager property to access the WatermarkManager object.\n\nWatermarks are located in section headers. If a document does not contain headers, WatermarkManager adds headers of the Primary type to all document sections.\n\nThe WatermarkManager.Type property indicates whether a document has watermarks. This property returns None if the document does not contain watermarks.\n\nCall one of the WatermarkManager.SetText method overloads to add a text watermark to the document. Pass a TextWatermarkOptions class instance to this method to specify text watermark options.\n\nThe code sample below adds a text watermark to all document pages.\n\nCall one of the WatermarkManager.SetImage method overloads to add an image watermark to the document. Pass an ImageWatermarkOptions class instance to this method to specify image watermark options.\n\nThe code sample below adds an image watermark to all document pages.\n\nThe Word Processing Document API allows you to insert watermarks into headers of individual sections.\n\nThe Word Processing Document API offers two ways to add watermarks to document sections.\n\nUse the WatermarkManager.SetText and WatermarkManager.SetImage method overloads with the section and headerType parameters to add text and image watermarks to headers of specific document sections. If a section you pass to these methods does not have a header of the specified type, WatermarkManager creates this header. Consider the following when you create section headers:\n• None Enable the Section.DifferentFirstPage property to create a separate header for the section’s first page.\n• None Enable the Document.DifferentOddAndEvenPages property to create different headers for odd and even pages.\n\nThe code sample below adds different watermarks to document sections. The SetImage method creates the first page header for the first section and adds an image watermark to the header. The SetText method creates a primary header (the same header for all pages) for the second section and inserts a text watermark into this header.\n\nWatermarks are stored in shape collections (ShapeCollection) of section headers. Call one of the Section.BeginUpdateHeader method overloads to access a header of the section in which you want to insert a watermark. Use the header’s SubDocument.Shapes property to return a collection of shapes located in this header. Use one of the following methods to add a text or image watermark to the header: ShapeCollection.InsertTextWatermark or ShapeCollection.InsertImageWatermark.\n\nAfter a watermark is inserted, you can use properties of the Shape object to change watermark position and size, rotate the watermark, and change its appearance.\n\nThe example below adds an image watermark to the first document section, customizes the watermark’s appearance, and rotates the watermark counterclockwise by 45 degrees.\n\nCall one of the Section.BeginUpdateHeader method overloads to access a section header that contains a watermark you want to modify. Use the header’s SubDocument.Shapes property to return a collection of shapes located in this header. Use the Shape.Type property to find a watermark in the collection. This property returns the Watermark value if a shape is a watermark.\n\nThe Shape.WatermarkFormat property allows you to obtain and modify watermark settings. Refer to the sections below for details on available options. You can use other properties of the Shape object to change watermark position, resize the watermark, and customize its appearance (add a border to a watermark image, fill and outline watermark text).\n\nThe WatermarkFormat.TextOptions property allows you to access and modify a watermark’s text settings (font attributes, text color, and layout).\n\nThe following code iterates through all document sections and updates settings for text watermarks in primary headers. The WatermarkFormat.Type property is used to check the watermark type.\n\nThe following image demonstrates the result:\n\nUse the WatermarkFormat.SetText method to assign new text to a watermark.\n\nThe code sample below adds a text watermark to all document sections and changes watermark text in the primary header of the first section.\n\nUse the WatermarkFormat.ImageOptions property to access and modify image watermark settings. You can change the image scale percentage (Scale) and apply or remove the washout effect (Washout).\n\nThe following code iterates through all document sections and updates settings for image watermarks in primary headers. The WatermarkFormat.Type property is used to check the watermark type.\n\nThe following image demonstrates the result:\n\nThe WatermarkFormat.SetImage method allows you to replace an existing watermark image with another image.\n\nThe following code adds an image watermark to all document sections and changes the image for the watermark located in the primary header of the first section:\n\nYou can remove watermarks from a document in one of the following ways:\n• None Use the WatermarkManager.Remove method overloads. Call this method without parameters to remove all watermarks from the document. Pass a document section and the type of the section header to the method to remove a watermark from an individual section.\n• None Call the ShapeCollection.Remove and ShapeCollection.RemoveAt methods to remove a watermark from a shape collection of a specific section header. Use the Shape.Type property to determine whether an object in the collection is a watermark.\n\nThe following example removes all watermarks from the document:"
