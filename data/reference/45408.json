        "document": "Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) is a type of computer language used to write programs that operate on the Windows operating system. It works as a type of internal programming language in Microsoft Office applications. That includes Excel, Microsoft Excel, Publisher, PowerPoint, and Visio. It is quite a powerful programming language created by Microsoft that is highly utilized across the industry. If you are looking to learn more about Visual Basic VB6, you’ll find this guide contains the information and resources you need to go from virtually no knowledge to having a strong foundation to use.\n\nVB6 fundamentals and practical applications are critical to learning in this format. That’s because each component builds on the other, creating a highly effective final level of knowledge. Let’s break down what Visual Basic VB6 is and why you may wish to use it.\n\n\n\nVisual Basic: The Basics to Get You Started\n\nWhat is Visual Basic? Visual Basic is a user-friendly programming language. It is often sought after because it is so simple to use and offers excellent readability. For those who do not have a lot of experience in this area, VB is a solid place to start.\n\nDevelopers using VB to create Windows applications. It can also be used to develop more complex and detailed programs. Some use it to automate repetitive tasks, too.\n\nVisual Basic is not a new language. In fact, it has been in place since the 1990s, though it has comprehensively changed since then. Its first uses were for GUI applications, which may seem simplistic by today’s standards. Today, it is often used for more complex programming needs as well.\n\nWhat Are the Benefits of Using VB Over Other Options?\n\nDevelopers have plenty of program options to select from, but VB offers a number of key advantages.\n• It is simple to use. Even beginners can learn it quickly enough to start using it right away.\n• As a developer tool, the ease of use allows you to move through your project more effectively and faster.\n• That makes it an excellent choice for those who want to develop web applications quickly or launch several at one time.\n• It provides ample flexibility for various types of software development.\n• With simple features like pre-built controls and a drag-and-drop interface, it is intuitive to use overall.\n\nIf you are still asking, “What is Visual Basic able to do for me,” Continue reading this Visual Basic 6 tutorial.\n\nStart By Setting Up Your Environment\n\nAs you will likely do with any type of development, you need to set up your environment. That means you need to set up an IDE – Integrated Development Environment.\n\nFor most people, Visual Studio, which is also developed and managed by Microsoft, is the ideal environment. You can use other options, and you may find that there are plenty of factors to consider in this process based on the type of work you plan to do.\n\nThe following guidelines are meant to be used alongside Visual Studio. Take some time before moving forward to learn a bit more about this interface and how it works. Then, jump in!\n\nYour first step, then, is to install Visual Studio. It supports most types of programming languages. The process of setting it up only takes a few minutes.\n• Go to Microsoft Visual Studio. There, you can download the Community Edition. There is no cost for this version of the program. It is meant for only individual developers to us. It is also used for open-source projects, research, and education. It is perfect for your first venture into this process.\n• Initiate the process. Follow the commands provided to install the software on your system. Run the program when the prompt shows up.\n• Choose workloads. This question will come up in the process. A workload is the features that you need for the development process. To select them, choose: .NET desktop development under the workload options. This will provide you with all of the components you need to be able to use VB to create desktop-related apps.\n• Complete installation. You will need to wait for the full installation process to occur. Depending on your download speed, it could take a few minutes or much longer. It will download the workloads you need.\n• Launch Visual Studio. Follow the instructions on the screen to create your own account. This is optional – you do not have to have or link your Microsoft account. Doing so allows you to sync across all of your Microsoft accounts.\n\nNow that you have Visual Studio set u, the next step is to learn to use it. Again, it is not hard to do, and just looking around the interface is likely to provide you with plenty of information to move forward with this process.\n\nHere are a few things you need to know about the Visual Studio interface.\n• You launch on the Start Page. This is also where you will be able to create a new project. You will be able to find and open the existing projects you have as well. The Start Page offers up to date resources and information.\n• Solution Explorer is the project file management tool. It is set up like any other tree structure where all of the files are in folders for each of the projects you create.\n• Your toolbox is where you will find the options for carrying out functions. That is where you can set up drag and drop, for example, if you are designing a GUI.\n• The main coding area is the location where you will input your code. This is perhaps the most important section for your needs.\n• Also note there is a properties window, which shows the properties of the selected items in your project. It will give you information such as the controls on a form.\n\nWhy all of this information first? The more you know about Visual Studio and how it works, the easier it is to use Visual Basic VB6. It only takes a few minutes to learn the details and it is well worth doing so.\n\nNow that you have a bit of experience in this area, it’s time to start creating your first VB project. To do so, follow these steps.\n\nVisual Basic 6 requires you to work through several steps to create a new project. First, make sure you are in Visual Studio. Then go to:\n\nPretty simple so far, right?\n\nWhen you get to “create a new project” you will then search for Visual Basic. Once you get there, click “Windows Forms App (.NET Framework). And then click “next.”\n\nYou need to name your project. Make sure you know what it is and make it unique. It needs both a name and location.\n\nYou can also add in more information. That includes the solution name as well as where to place the project in a specific directory (or not to do so yet).\n\nNow that Visual Studio created your project, it will open in the main form in design view. That’s called Form1.\n\nIt is a good idea to check out some of the files here. You can use the Solution Explorer to help you to do this. Click on it and you will see each of the automatically created files. This also includes the main form’s code file.\n\nThe Design View now lets you design the interface of your application. It is easy to use with its drag and drop features. You can make it fit the specific needs you want using Visual Basic Visual features.\n\nYou can also use Code View to see the project code. To adjust this setting, click “View Code” when you right-click on the form. This is where you will then write your code for the functionalities you expect to operate with your new web application.\n\nNow that you have everything set up to start the process, it is important to learn a bit about Visual Basic theory as well as understanding the core concepts required for this programming language. There are several key processes to learn including basic syntax as well as variables and data types. Here, we will break down the most important foundational topics you need to move your education forward.\n\nSyntax is a term used to describe the rules that define communication in the programming language. That is, it is the combination of symbols that come together to create structured programs. The good news is that Visual Basic is rather straightforward in this area and is known for its readability. This simplistic design is not limiting, though, and it can be an excellent place for beginners to learn basic coding skills.\n\nHere are some of the syntax or rules you need to know moving into this process to capture true skill in Visual Basic VB6.\n\nThe first thing to know is that VB is not case sensitive. Many other programming languages are. That means that no matter if you type a symbol as a capital or a lowercase, the system recognizes it as the same. That is one way it is easier than other programming languages.\n\nWhen creating VB code, each statement or set of steps is on a single line. You do not have to pay any type of symbol at the end of the line to tell the system that it is the end of that statement. In other programming languages, that is often the case. Without a special character at the end, that is one thing you have to worry about in this process.\n\nA comment is a non-executable line. Comments help you to document your code. To add a comment, you will use a single quote character -= ‘ – to start the beginning of the comment.\n\nThe next set of specific rules you need to learn are variables and data types. A variable is used to store data that can be changed during program execution. When entering a variable, it must be declared before use. In doing so, you need to specify the type. Consider the following.\n\nTo declare variables, you need to create a statement. Use DIM statement to declare a variable. Then, enter the variable name and then the type. In this situation, it would look like:\n\nVisual Basics uses various types of data types. Here are some of those that you are most likely to use and should remember:\n• Integer: Used for whole numbers\n• Boolean: Used for true and false statements or values\n• Double: Used for large or decimal numbers\n\nFinally, you need to assign the variable. To do this, you use = operator. In the above example, it would read:\n\nThe next element of the scrip Visual Basic skill you need to learn is about operators and expressions.\n\nOperators are symbols that specify the type of operation you want to perform with the operands. You will need to remember a few of these.\n• <> for not equal to\n• < for less than\n• > for more than\n\nThese are used in decision-making tasks.\n\nThe next component is the expression. Expressions (like in math class) are a combination of operators and operands that VB uses to evaluate and produce another value. Using the same example as above, you may use:\n\nWith Visual Basic programming, you will be able to take these simple terms and transform them into code that you can use to create all sorts of outcomes. You can use these simple components and add more complex elements to them to achieve your goals. It is a good idea to practice these a bit to ensure you know exactly what to expect.\n\nThe next component to learn is controls, which are the building blocks of a Windows Form application. Controls are objects in a form that enables the user to interact with them. The following are some of the most common controls:\n• Text boxes: expressed as (TextBox) This will allow the user to input text\n• Buttons: expressed as (Button) This allows a user to trigger an action\n• Labels: expressed as (Label) This allows for text to be displayed, such as for a label\n\nHow to Use These Controls\n\nNow that you know what the controls are, how do you make them create the outcome you desire? Here are some simple steps to try out.\n\nTo add controls to a form, go into Visual Studio Design View. Find the toolbox that contains controls. Drag and drop the controls onto your form. You can then move them, change the size, or adjust them in other ways.\n\nEach control has a property, which includes text, size, and location. These are all aspects you can change and set up. You can adjust the text of a button or the label of a properties window, for example, by configuring them. You can set these at design time or at runtime.\n\nAn event is an action or an occurrence that happens when a program is running. Controls are able to respond to various events. For example, this may include a change in the text or a click.\n\nAn event handler is a portion or block of code that executes in response to an event. In this situation, you may want to set up the clicking of a button leading to a Click event.\n\nTo write this, you will double click a control in Design View. When you do this, it instantly creates an event handler for the default event. When you are in code view, this generates a stub method where you can write the code that executes when that event takes place.\n\nPulling It All Together: Visual Basic VB6 Program Writing\n\nNow that you have a solid understanding of the foundational skills, it’s time to pull the process together to write your own program.\n\nAt this point, you should be able to set up your environment and then work with controls to create outcomes. Once you master that, you can create a simple application using Visual Basic VB6.\n\nBefore you can get started, take the time to plan your project. You need to know what you want the program to accomplish. Once you do this, you’ll follow these steps:\n• Sketch the interface: Create a plan for a simple interface with a TextBox, for example, a button and label.\n• Plan the logic: Next, plan the goal. What do you want to occur? For example, when a person clicks the button, the program gathers the information from the text box, puts together an answer, and displays it on the label.\n\nCreate your own plan now. Choose an action you want to accomplish.\n\nTo code this, follow these steps:\n• Add controls: Position the TextBox, a Button, and a Label on the form using the steps provided earlier.\n• Configure the properties: Set up the appropriate names and default texts for each of the controls.\n• Handle the Button Click Event by double-clicking the button in the design view to create a click event handler in the code view. Then, select the method, write the code to construct what you want to occur.\n• Write the code for the method you wish to create.\n\nOnce you complete your project, it is necessary (and good practice) to run and test the application. You can do this easily by pressing the F5 or clicking the Start button located in Visual Studio. That will run your application. You can then try out your application to see if it works.\n\nWhat happens when something does not work? It is not uncommon to find yourself with a bug in your code especially if you are brand new at the process. You will need to debug to find the problem.\n\nCommon Visual Basic errors include syntax errors, such as misspelling a word or not including punctuation. Runtime errors can happen when the program is running. This tends to be the result of invalid user input or a file that is not found. The third common cause is a logical error, which is the hardest to pinpoint because no specific error message has been created.\n\nUse Visual Basic debugging tools to help you\n\nVisual Studio offers various debugging tools that can both find and fix these types of errors for you. It’s a good idea to learn these:\n• Breakpoints: In short, this is a break or pause of the execution of the program. It allows you to examine its state.\n• Step through code: When the program is paused, you can step through your code, going from one line to the next, to observe how the variables and states change.\n• Watch and local windows: This option will monitor the values of variables as your code executes.\n\nSo far, you have learned the basics of Visual Basic VB6. What about putting this to work to achieve the goal you have? For example, you may want to use it for web scraping, the process of gathering data from various websites to compile it into a logical and effective database so you can analyze it.\n\nIt is possible to learn this. The process is a bit more complex and requires some more in-depth coding knowledge. The good news is that you can get some help with this.\n\n\n\nCheck Out How Rayobyte Can Help You\n\nRayobyte is a proxy partner, meaning that we work with you to provide you with a large proxy pool to limit your blocking.

        "document": "Microsoft's programming language based on BASIC and COM\n\nVisual Basic (VB), sometimes referred to as Classic Visual Basic,[1][2] is a third-generation programming language based on BASIC, as well as an associated integrated development environment (IDE). Visual Basic was developed by Microsoft for Windows, and is known for supporting rapid application development (RAD) of graphical user interface (GUI) applications, event-driven programming, and both consumption and development of components via the Component Object Model (COM) technology.\n\nVB was first released in 1991. The final release was version 6 (VB6) in 1998. On April 8, 2008, Microsoft stopped supporting the VB6 IDE, relegating it to legacy status. The Microsoft VB team still maintains compatibility for VB6 applications through its \"It Just Works\" program on supported Windows operating systems.[3]\n\nVisual Basic .NET (VB.NET) is based on Classic Visual Basic. Because VB.NET was later rebranded back to Visual Basic, the name is ambiguous: it can refer to either Classic Visual Basic or to the .NET version.\n\nJust as BASIC was originally intended to be easy to learn, Microsoft intended the same for VB.[4][5]\n\nDevelopment of a VB application is exclusively supported via the VB integrated development environment (IDE), an application in the contemporary Visual Studio suite of tools. Unlike modern versions of Visual Studio, which support many languages including VB (.NET), the VB IDE only supports VB.\n\nIn 2014, some software developers still preferred Visual Basic 6.0 over its successor, Visual Basic .NET.[6] Visual Basic 6.0 was selected as the most dreaded programming language by respondents of Stack Overflow's annual developer survey in 2016, 2017, and 2018.[7][8][9]\n\nAs was the intention of older BASIC variants, VB was intended to have a low learning curve. Further, the IDE was intended to promote productivity; even for complex GUI applications. Programming involves visually arranging components or controls on a form, specifying attributes and actions for those components, and writing code that directs behavior. Since components have default attributes and actions, a programmer can develop a simple program without writing much code.\n\nPrograms built with earlier versions suffered performance problems, but faster computers and native code compilation made this less of an issue.\n\nSince a VB program is compiled as a native code executable instead of interpreted as old BASIC variants, it runs relatively fast and requires relatively little storage space. But, from version 5 on, it requires relatively large library files to be loaded at runtime; about 1 MB. Core runtime libraries are included by default in Windows 2000 and later, but extended runtime components require extra installation consideration. Earlier versions of Microsoft Windows (95/98/NT), require the runtime libraries to be distributed with the executable.\n\nForms are created using drag-and-drop techniques. A tool is used to place controls (e.g., text boxes, buttons, etc.) on the form (window). Controls have attributes and event handlers associated with them. Default values are provided when the control is created, but may be changed by the programmer. Many attribute values can be modified during run time based on user actions or changes in the environment, providing a dynamic application. For example, code can be inserted into the form resize event handler to reposition a control so that it remains centered on the form, expands to fill up the form, etc. By inserting code into the event handler for a keypress in a text box, the program can automatically translate the case of the text being entered, or even prevent certain characters from being inserted.\n\nDevelopment in the IDE is organized as a project which can be configured to output as a program (EXE), a dynamic-link library (DLL) or an ActiveX control library (OCX) which is a specialized DLL.\n\nControls provide the graphical functionality of a GUI application, and programmers attach code to event handlers to perform actions. For example, a drop-down control displays a list of items. When the user selects an item, an event handler is automatically called that executes the code that the programmer attached to the handler.\n\nFor a DLL, the VB code generally provides no user interface, and instead provides COM objects to other programs. This allows for capabilities such as server-side processing or an add-in module.\n\nVia the COM technology, unused memory is recovered for reuse using reference counting; recovering when the count reaches zero. VB reduces the count when a variable goes out of scope or when assigned to . This design prevents memory leaks that plague some, older languages such as C & C++. It differs significantly from the more modern approach of garbage collection.\n\nVB provides a large library of utility objects, and it provides basic support for object-oriented programming.\n\nUnlike many other programming languages, VB code is not case-sensitive – though the IDE transforms keywords into a standard case and variable names to match the case used elsewhere in the project. Of note, string comparison is case sensitive by default.\n\nThe VB compiler is shared with other Visual Studio suite languages, C and C++. Nevertheless, by default the restrictions in the IDE do not allow creation of some targets (Windows model DLLs) and threading models, but over the years, developers have bypassed these restrictions.\n\nVisual Basic has notable features and characteristics that are in some cases different than other BASIC variants or from other common languages:\n• Enables rapid application development (RAD) of graphical user interface (GUI) applications, access to databases using Jet Data Access Objects, Remote Data Objects, or ActiveX Data Object (ADO), and creation of ActiveX controls and COM objects.\n• Allows use of the Windows API via an external function declaration technology\n• Supports sharing and reuse via the COM component technology. A programmer can create an application using components provided by VB, developed internally or from third parties. Over time the development community produced and shared many components. 6 10 11 12 13\n• Unlike older BASIC variants, instead of requiring line numbers to support branching, code is grouped into named blocks delimited by Sub...End Sub or Function...End Function. VB retains line number support 14\n• Code statements have no terminating character other than a line ending (carriage return/line feed), and versions since 3 allow for multi-line statements for concatenation of strings or explicitly using the underscore character (_) at the end of a line 15 16\n• A code comment is denoted by a single apostrophe (') character, like:\n• Looping statement blocks begin and end with keywords: Do...Loop, While...End While, For...Next 17\n• Chained variable assignment is not allowed; for example does not result in the values of A, B and C being equal. The Boolean result of \"is B equal to C?\" is stored in A\n• Like other BASIC variants, but unlike many other languages that use 1, Boolean has numeric value −1. VB stores a Boolean as a two's complement signed integer with all ones in binary for true and zero for false. This is apparent when performing a (bitwise) operation on the two's complement value 0, which returns the two's complement value −1, in other words . This inherent functionality becomes especially useful when performing logical operations on the individual bits of an integer such as , , and . 18 This definition of is also consistent with BASIC since the early 1970s Microsoft BASIC implementation and is also related to the characteristics of CPU instructions at the time.\n• Logical and bitwise operators are unified. This is unlike some C-derived languages (such as Perl), which have separate logical and bitwise operators. This is a traditional feature of BASIC.\n• Unlike for many languages which use zero for the lower bound of an array, VB allows the lower bound to be any value – like in Pascal and Fortran. The statement can be used to set the default lower bound, but some claim that its use leads to confusion when reading code and is best avoided by always explicitly specifying the lower bound. This uncommon language trait does exist in Visual Basic .NET but not in VBScript.\n• Tightly bound to the Windows operating system and the Component Object Model. The native types for strings and arrays are the dedicated COM types, BSTR and SAFEARRAY.\n• Banker's rounding as the default behavior when converting real numbers to integers with the function. 19 gives 2, gives 4.\n• An integer type value is automatically promoted to a floating point type in expressions that involve the normal division operator ( ) so that division of one integer by another produces a result that may seem more intuitive from a mathematical perspective. VB provides an integer divide operator ( ) that does truncate.\n• By default, if a variable has not been declared or if no type declaration character is specified, it acts like a . However this can be changed with Deftype statements such as , , , , . There are 12 statements in total offered by Visual Basic 6.0. The default type may be overridden for a specific declaration by using a special suffix character on the variable name ( for Double, for Single, for Long, for Integer, for String, and for Currency) or using the key phrase . VB can be set up to require variable declarations via .\n\nBYTE reported in 1989 that, based on its experience with Macintosh software development, Microsoft \"wants to provide a development environment that mimics the delivery environment\". BASIC's string handling was preferable to C, the company's Greg Lobdell said, when developing the mostly transaction-processing applications Microsoft expected object-oriented programming tools to create.[20] Visual Basic 1.0 was introduced in 1991. The drag and drop design for creating the user interface is derived from a prototype form generator developed by Alan Cooper and his company called Tripod.[21][22][23] Microsoft contracted with Cooper and his associates to develop Tripod into a programmable form system for Windows 3.0, under the code name Ruby (no relation to the later Ruby programming language). Tripod did not include a programming language at all. Microsoft decided to combine Ruby with the Basic language to create Visual Basic. The Ruby interface generator provided the \"visual\" part of Visual Basic, and this was combined with the \"EB\" Embedded BASIC engine designed for Microsoft's abandoned \"Omega\" database system. Ruby also provided the ability to load dynamic link libraries containing additional controls (then called \"gizmos\"), which later became the VBX interface.[24]\n• Project 'basic Thunder' was initiated in 1990. 25 Thunder persisted through to the last release of Visual Basic in the name of the primary internal function, \"ThunderRTMain\".\n• Visual Basic 1.0 (May 1991) was released for Windows at the Comdex/Windows World trade show in Atlanta, Georgia.\n• Visual Basic 1.0 for DOS was released in September 1992. The language itself was not quite compatible with Visual Basic for Windows, as it was the next version of Microsoft's DOS-based BASIC compilers, QuickBASIC and BASIC Professional Development System. The interface used a text-based user interface, using extended ASCII characters to simulate the appearance of a GUI.\n• Visual Basic 2.0 was released in November 1992. The programming environment was easier to use, and its speed was improved. Notably, forms became instantiable objects, thus laying the foundational concepts of class modules as were later offered in VB4.\n• Visual Basic 3.0 was released in the summer of 1993 and came in Standard and Professional versions. VB3 included version 1.1 of the Jet Database Engine that could read and write Jet (or Access) 1.x databases.\n• Visual Basic 4.0 (August 1995) was the first version that could create 32-bit as well as 16-bit Windows programs. It has three editions; Standard, Professional, and Enterprise. It also introduced the ability to write non-GUI classes in Visual Basic. With VB4 the language was separated from the GUI library, and made available as VBA, in which form it was embedded with the Office 95 suite. To ease migration of Office macros and scripts, features from WordBasic, Excel Basic and Access Basic were incorporated into the language. Incompatibilities between different releases of VB4 caused installation and operation problems. While previous versions of Visual Basic had used VBX controls, Visual Basic now used OLE controls (with files names ending in .OCX) instead. These were later to be named ActiveX controls.\n• With version 5.0 (February 1997), Microsoft released Visual Basic exclusively for 32-bit versions of Windows. Programmers who preferred to write 16-bit programs were able to import programs written in Visual Basic 4.0 to Visual Basic 5.0, and Visual Basic 5.0 programs can easily be converted to Visual Basic 4.0. Visual Basic 5.0 also introduced the ability to create custom user controls, as well as the ability to compile to native Windows executable code, speeding up calculation-intensive code execution. A free, downloadable Control Creation Edition was also released for creation of ActiveX controls. It was also used as an introductory form of Visual Basic: a regular .exe project could be created and run in the IDE, but not compiled.\n• Visual Basic 6.0 (Mid-1998) improved in a number of areas 26 including the ability to create web-based applications.\n• Mainstream Support for Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 ended on March 31, 2005, and Extended support ended in March 2008. 27 However, primary components of the Visual Basic 6 development environment run in all 32-bit versions of Windows up to and including Windows 11. 28\n• Visual Basic .NET is Microsoft's successor to Visual Basic 6.0, and part of Microsoft's .NET ecosystem (which over time has sometimes been called framework and core). It is not backwards compatible with Visual Basic 6.0. An automated conversion tool exists, but fully automated conversion for most projects is not possible. 29\n• Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) 30 is a scripting language embedded in many Microsoft applications such as Microsoft Office, and third-party products like SolidWorks, AutoCAD, WordPerfect Office 2002, ArcGIS, Sage 300 ERP, and Business Objects Desktop Intelligence. There are small inconsistencies in the way VBA is implemented in different applications, but it is largely the same language as Visual Basic 6.0 and uses the same runtime library. Visual Basic development ended with 6.0, but in 2010 Microsoft introduced VBA 7 to provide extended features and add 64-bit support. 31\n• VBScript is the default language for Active Server Pages. It can be used in Windows scripting and client-side web page scripting. It resembles VB in syntax, but is a separate language—executed by vbscript.dll instead of the VB runtime. ASP and VBScript should not be confused with ASP.NET, which uses the .NET Framework for compiled web pages.\n• OpenOffice Basic is a Visual Basic compatible interpreter that originated in StarOffice office suite.\n• Gambas is a Visual Basic inspired free software programming language for the Linux operating system. It is not a clone of Visual Basic, but it does have the ability to convert Visual Basic programs to Gambas.\n• LotusScript is a VBA variant available in Lotus SmartSuite and Lotus Notes.\n• Later versions of Corel WordPerfect Office implement access to VBA as one of the macro/scripting languages, the other major ones being CorelScript and PerfectScript.\n• Earlier versions of Microsoft Word use a variant of VB called WordBasic.\n\nVersions before 5 compiled the code to P-Code – which is interpreted at runtime. The benefits of P-Code include portability and smaller binary file sizes, but it usually slows execution, since an interpreter adds a layer to the execution environment. VB applications require the Microsoft VB runtime MSVBVM##.DLL, where ## is a version number, either 50 or 60. MSVBVM60.dll comes standard with Windows in all editions from Windows 98 to Windows 11 although some editions of Windows 7 do not include it. For Windows 95 however the application installation process requires the DLL needed by the program. VB 5 and 6 can compile code to either native or P-Code but the runtime is still required for built-in functions and forms management.\n• versioning problems associated with DLLs, known as \"DLL hell\"\n• can only create multi-threaded applications using ActiveX or DLL\n• variant types having a greater performance and storage \"overhead\" than strongly-typed programming languages\n• dependency on complex and fragile COM registry entries 34\n\nAll versions of the Visual Basic IDE, from 1.0 to 6.0, are no longer supported by Microsoft. The associated runtime environments are also unsupported, except for the Visual Basic 6 core runtime environment, which Microsoft officially supports for the lifetime of Windows 10[35] and Windows 11.[36] Third party components that shipped with Visual Studio 6.0 are not included in this support statement. Some legacy Visual Basic components may still work on newer platforms, despite being unsupported by Microsoft and other vendors. Documentation for Visual Basic 6.0, its application programming interface and tools is best covered in the last MSDN release before Visual Studio.NET 2002. Later releases of MSDN focused on .NET development and had significant parts of the Visual Basic 6.0 programming documentation removed as the language evolved, and support for older code ended. Although vendor support for Visual Basic 6 has ended, and the product has never been supported on the latest versions of Windows, key parts of the environment still work on newer platforms. It is possible to get a subset of the development environment working on 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10 and Windows 11.[37] Owing to its persistent remaining popularity,[38] third-party attempts to further support it, such as Rubberduck, exist.[39]\n\nThe following code snippet displays a message box saying \"Hello, World!\" as the window loads:\n\nThis snippet makes a counter that moves up 1 every second (a label and a timer control need to be added to the form for this to work) until the form is closed or an integer overflow occurs:\n• – a function in several editions of Visual Basic roughly equivalent to the ?: conditional operator of C and related languages.\n• Secure your Visual Basic 6.0 investment with Microsoft .NET: Migrating from Visual Basic 6.0 to Visual Basic 2008"
