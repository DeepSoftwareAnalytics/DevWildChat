        "document": "Artifact Registry: provides a single place for your organization to manage container images and language packages (such as Maven and npm). It is fully integrated with Google Cloud’s tooling and runtimes and comes with support for native artifact protocols. This makes it simple to integrate it with your CI/CD tooling to set up automated pipelines.\n\nIn order to use this library, you first need to go through the following steps:\n\nInstall this library in a virtual environment using venv. venv is a tool that creates isolated Python environments. These isolated environments can have separate versions of Python packages, which allows you to isolate one project’s dependencies from the dependencies of other projects.\n\nWith venv, it’s possible to install this library without needing system install permissions, and without clashing with the installed system dependencies.\n\nCode samples and snippets live in the samples/ folder.\n\nOur client libraries are compatible with all current active and maintenance versions of Python.\n\nIf you are using an end-of-life version of Python, we recommend that you update as soon as possible to an actively supported version.\n• None Read the Client Library Documentation for Artifact Registry to see other available methods on the client.\n• None Read the Artifact Registry Product documentation to learn more about the product and see How-to Guides.\n• None View this README to see the full list of Cloud APIs that we cover."

If set to None, a transport is chosen automatically. \n\n Custom options for the client. 1. The property can be used to override the default endpoint provided by the client when is not explicitly provided. Only if this property is not set and was not explicitly provided, the endpoint is determined by the GOOGLE_API_USE_MTLS_ENDPOINT environment variable, which have one of the following values: \"always\" (always use the default mTLS endpoint), \"never\" (always use the default regular endpoint) and \"auto\" (auto-switch to the default mTLS endpoint if client certificate is present; this is the default value). 2. If the GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE environment variable is \"true\", then the property can be used to provide a client certificate for mTLS transport. If not provided, the default SSL client certificate will be used if present. If GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE is \"false\" or not set, no client certificate will be used. 3. The property can be used to override the default \"googleapis.com\" universe. Note that the property still takes precedence; and is currently not supported for mTLS. \n\n The client info used to send a user-agent string along with API requests.

Normally, each value must be of type , but for metadata keys ending with the suffix , the corresponding values must be of type .\n\nDeprecated. Return the API endpoint and client cert source for mutual TLS. The client cert source is determined in the following order: (1) if environment variable is not \"true\", the client cert source is None. (2) if is provided, use the provided one; if the default client cert source exists, use the default one; otherwise the client cert source is None. The API endpoint is determined in the following order: (1) if if provided, use the provided one. (2) if environment variable is \"always\", use the default mTLS endpoint; if the environment variable is \"never\", use the default API endpoint; otherwise if client cert source exists, use the default mTLS endpoint, otherwise use the default API endpoint.
