You can provide a path-like object or file-like object.\n• is the sampling rate of the audio\n• is the number of channels\n• is the number of frames per channel The values can take are one of the following\n• None of above\n• can be for formats with compression and/or variable bit rate (such as mp3).\n• can be for GSM-FR format. function works on file-like object as well. Note When passing file-like object, function does not read all the data, instead it only reads the beginning portion of data. Therefore, depending on the audio format, it cannot get the correct metadata, including the format itself. The following example illustrates this.\n• Use argument to tell what audio format it is. To load audio data, you can use . The returned value is a tuple of waveform ( ) and sample rate ( ). By default, the resulting tensor object has and its value range is normalized within . For the list of supported format, please refer to the torchaudio documentation. ’s I/O functions now support file-like object. This allows to fetch audio data and decode at the same time from the location other than local file system. The following examples illustrates this. Providing and arguments will slice the resulting Tensor object while decoding. The same result can be achieved using the regular Tensor slicing, (i.e. ) however, providing and arguments is more efficient. This is because the function will stop data acquisition and decoding once it finishes decoding the requested frames. This is advantageous when the audio data are transfered via network as the data transfer will stop as soon as the necessary amount of data is fetched. The following example illustrates this; # Illustration of two different decoding methods. # The first one will fetch all the data and decode them, while # the second one will stop fetching data once it completes decoding. \"Fetching until the requested frames are available...\" Fetching all the data... - Fetched 108844 bytes Fetching until the requested frames are available... - Fetched 65580 bytes Checking the resulting waveform ... matched! To save audio data in the formats intepretable by common applications, you can use . When passing file-like object, you also need to provide argument so that the function knows which format it should be using. In case of path-like object, the function will detemine the format based on the extension. If you are saving to a file without extension, you need to provide argument. When saving as WAV format, the default encoding for Tensor is 32-bit floating-point PCM. You can provide and argument to change this. For example, to save data in 16 bit signed integer PCM, you can do the following. Note Saving data in encodings with lower bit depth reduces the resulting file size but loses precision. # The function will pick up the encoding which # The resulting file occupies half the storage but loses precision can also handle other formats. To name a few; Similar to the other I/O functions, you can save audio into file-like object. When saving to file-like object, argument is required.\n\nTo resample an audio waveform from one freqeuncy to another, you can use or . precomputes and caches the kernel used for resampling, while computes it on the fly, so using will result in a speedup if resampling multiple waveforms using the same parameters (see Benchmarking section). Both resampling methods use bandlimited sinc interpolation to compute signal values at arbitrary time steps. The implementation involves convolution, so we can take advantage of GPU / multithreading for performance improvements. When using resampling in multiple subprocesses, such as data loading with multiple worker processes, your application might create more threads than your system can handle efficiently. Setting might help in this case. Because a finite number of samples can only represent a finite number of frequencies, resampling does not produce perfect results, and a variety of parameters can be used to control for its quality and computational speed. We demonstrate these properties through resampling a logarithmic sine sweep, which is a sine wave that increases exponentially in frequency over time. The spectrograms below show the frequency representation of the signal, where the x-axis labels correspond to the frequency of the original waveform (in log scale), the y-axis corresponds to the frequency of the plotted waveform, and the color intensity refers to amplitude. Because the filter used for interpolation extends infinitely, the parameter is used to control for the width of the filter to use to window the interpolation. It is also referred to as the number of zero crossings, since the interpolation passes through zero at every time unit. Using a larger provides a sharper, more precise filter, but is more computationally expensive. The parameter is represented as a fraction of the Nyquist frequency, which is the maximal frequency representable by a given finite sample rate. determines the lowpass filter cutoff and controls the degree of aliasing, which takes place when frequencies higher than the Nyquist are mapped to lower frequencies. A lower rolloff will therefore reduce the amount of aliasing, but it will also reduce some of the higher frequencies. By default, torchaudio’s resample uses the Hann window filter, which is a weighted cosine function. It additionally supports the Kaiser window, which is a near optimal window function that contains an additional parameter that allows for the design of the smoothness of the filter and width of impulse. This can be controlled using the parameter. torchaudio’s resample function can be used to produce results similar to that of librosa (resampy)’s kaiser window resampling, with some noise torchaudio and librosa kaiser best MSE: 2.080690115365992e-06 torchaudio and librosa kaiser fast MSE: 2.5200744248601027e-05 Below are benchmarks for downsampling and upsampling waveforms between two pairs of sampling rates. We demonstrate the performance implications that the , window type, and sample rates can have. Additionally, we provide a comparison against ’s and using their corresponding parameters in . To elaborate on the results:\n• a larger results in a larger resampling kernel, and therefore increases computation time for both the kernel computation and convolution\n• using results in longer computation times than the default because it is more complex to compute the intermediate window values - a large GCD between the sample and resample rate will result in a simplification that allows for a smaller kernel and faster kernel computation.\n\nprovides a variety of ways to augment audio data. module provides ways to apply filiters like command on Tensor objects and file-object audio sources directly. There are two functions for this;\n• for applying effects on other audio source Both function takes effects in the form of . This mostly corresponds to how command works, but one caveat is that command adds some effects automatically, but torchaudio’s implementation does not do that. For the list of available effects, please refer to the sox documentation. Tip If you need to load and resample your audio data on-the-fly, then you can use with effect. Note accepts file-like object or path-like object. Similar to , when the audio format cannot be detected from either file extension or header, you can provide argument to tell what format the audio source is. Note This process is not differentiable. # This only changes sample rate, so it is necessary to # add `rate` effect with original sample rate after this. Note that the number of frames and number of channels are different from the original after the effects. Let’s listen to the audio. Doesn’t it sound more dramatic? Convolution reverb is a technique used to make a clean audio data sound like in a different environment. Using Room Impulse Response (RIR), we can make a clean speech sound like uttered in a conference room. For this process, we need RIR data. The following data are from VOiCES dataset, but you can record one by your self. Just turn on microphone and clap you hands. First, we need to clean up the RIR. We extract the main impulse, normalize the signal power, then flip the time axis. Then we convolve the speech signal with the RIR filter. To add background noise to audio data, you can simply add audio Tensor and noise Tensor. A commonly way to adjust the intensity of noise is to change Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). [wikipedia] Note This process is not differentiable. Combining the previous techniques, we can simulate audio that sounds like a person talking over a phone in a echoey room with people talking in the background. # Because the noise is recorded in the actual environment, we consider that # the noise contains the acoustic feature of the environment. Therefore, we add\n\nimplements feature extractions commonly used in audio domain. They are available in and . module implements features as a stand alone functions. They are stateless. module implements features in object-oriented manner, using implementations from and . Because all the transforms are subclass of , they can be serialized using TorchScript. For the complete list of available features, please refer to the documentation. In this tutorial, we will look into conversion between time domain and frequency domain ( , , ) and augmentation technique called SpecAugment. To get the frequency representation of audio signal, you can use transform. To recover a waveform from spectrogram, you can use . can generate the filter bank to convert frequency bins to Mel-scale bins. Since this function does not require input audio/features, there is no equivalent transform in . As a comparison, here is the equivalent way to get the mel filter bank with . Mel-scale spectrogram is a combination of Spectrogram and mel scale conversion. In , there is a transform which is composed of and .

Use these classes to opt into their customized displays for a more consistent rendering across browsers and devices.\n\nBe sure to use an appropriate attribute on all inputs (e.g., for email address or for numerical information) to take advantage of newer input controls like email verification, number selection, and more.\n\nHere’s a quick example to demonstrate Bootstrap’s form styles. Keep reading for documentation on required classes, form layout, and more.\n\nBlock-level or inline-level form text can be created using .\n\nForm text below inputs can be styled with . If a block-level element will be used, a top margin is added for easy spacing from the inputs above.\n\nInline text can use any typical inline HTML element (be it a , , or something else) with nothing more than the class.\n\nAdd the boolean attribute on an input to prevent user interactions and make it appear lighter.\n\nAdd the attribute to a to disable all the controls within. Browsers treat all native form controls ( , , and elements) inside a as disabled, preventing both keyboard and mouse interactions on them.\n\nHowever, if your form also includes custom button-like elements such as , these will only be given a style of , meaning they are still focusable and operable using the keyboard. In this case, you must manually modify these controls by adding to prevent them from receiving focus and to signal their state to assistive technologies.\n\nEnsure that all form controls have an appropriate accessible name so that their purpose can be conveyed to users of assistive technologies. The simplest way to achieve this is to use a element, or—in the case of buttons—to include sufficiently descriptive text as part of the content.\n\nFor situations where it’s not possible to include a visible or appropriate text content, there are alternative ways of still providing an accessible name, such as:\n• Pointing to an existing element that can act as a label using\n• Explicitly setting the accessible name on an element using\n\nIf none of these are present, assistive technologies may resort to using the attribute as a fallback for the accessible name on and elements.

        "document": "Bootstrap is a free and open-source collection of CSS and JavaScript/jQuery code used for creating dynamic websites layout and web applications. Bootstrap is one of the most popular front-end frameworks which has really a nice set of predefined CSS codes. Bootstrap uses different types of classes to make responsive websites. Bootstrap 5 was officially released on 16 June 2020 after several months of redefining its features.\n\nBootstrap is a framework that is suitable for mobile-friendly web development. it means the code and the template available on bootstrap are applicable to various screen sizes. It is responsive for every screen size. The framework is free and can be used in 2 ways that are either by downloading the zip files and including libraries/modules of bootstrap in the project or directly including the URL of bootstrap and using the online version.\n\nSome important changes in Bootstrap 5:\n\n1. Updated official documentation: The docs homepage of v4.5.0 has an updated look and there are some improvements in the rest of the official docs too. Bootstrap docs have some nice padding around the corners to make it more readable and highlight its content.\n\n2. jQuery is removed completely: Earlier, bootstrap components like modals, tooltips, popovers etc, were dependent on jQuery and popper.js. After the release of the alpha 5 version, Bootstrap no longer depends on jQuery. While jQuery has been used in Bootstrap for more than 8 years, many developers had this issue that jQuery brought uneven access to complex JavaScript behaviors to them. The whole process made possible by their JavaScript maintainer https://github.com/johann-s\n\n3. Switch to Vanilla JavaScript: JavaScript is the programming language of the web. Most of the modern websites are powered by JavaScript and all modern web browsers on phones, tablets, consoles, desktops include JavaScript Interpreters. One of the major reasons of dropping jQuery was to redefine the framework completely on modern JavaScript standards.\n\n4. Dropped support of Internet Explorer 10 and 11: Internet Explorer was released in 1995 by Microsoft. As of today, Internet Explorer is no longer relevant with popular browsers like Chrome and Microsoft Edge which are built on chromium. When bootstrap decided to refine their framework purely on Vanilla JavaScript, they dropped the support of IE which is not compatible with modern JavaScript standards.\n\n5. Responsive Fonts: Bootstrap has introduced responsive font sizes which will automatically resize the typography element according to the viewport size through the RFS Engine. RFS engine was developed to resize font sizes. It provides the facility to resize the CSS properties like “margin”, “padding”, “border-radius”, “box-shadow” by units.\n\n6. Removed Cards: The new grid system of Bootstrap provides more responsive control of the layout. Hence, they removed unnecessary extra classes which can be designed by the new grid layout. The older versions of Bootstrap still support card system.\n\n7. Updated Forms: Bootstrap 5 has introduced a section completely dedicated to Bootstrap forms with improved documentation and components. It now has a single set of form controls and redesign existing elements instead of generating new elements through pseudo-elements. Bootstrap forms give a better look now.\n\n8. New SVG and Icons library: Bootstrap 3 had introduced 250 reusable icon components called “Glyphicons” which were created to offer icons for alerts,dropdowns, input fields, etc. Bootstrap 4 completely removed glyphicons as most of the designers used icons from websites like Fontawesome, icons8, etc. Otherwise, they use their self created SVG icons to enhance customizability. Bootstrap 5 has released a new SVG icon library which was undertaken by the co-founder of Bootstrap Mark Otto.\n\nFor more information refer to this link: Get Bootstrap"

Forms are an important way to interact with users on your website.\n\nBootstrap provides form control components that you can add to your project to easily style your web forms.\n\nIn this tutorial, we’ll cover all there is to know about creating responsive forms with Bootstrap. Before we begin, let’s briefly understand what Bootstrap is and the importance of web forms.\n\nBootstrap is a framework designed to assist developers in creating responsive and visually appealing websites with ease. Think of Bootstrap as a comprehensive toolkit that provides a variety of ready-to-use components.\n\nThis includes CSS and JavaScript elements that are essential for modern web design. The framework is favored for its responsiveness, ensuring websites are mobile-friendly and adjustable across various devices.\n\nIt simplifies the web development process, allowing developers to focus on functionality without compromising on aesthetics.\n\nSpeaking of simplifying development, PureCode provides a list of 10k AI-generated templates to speed up your workflow. Our templates include form components to help you quickly create forms for your website.\n\nWeb forms are the primary method of gathering user input, required for tasks such as user registration, data collection, feedback submission, and online transactions.\n\nThe design and usability of forms significantly impact user experience. Well-designed forms improve user engagement and contribute to the overall effectiveness of a website. They need to be intuitive, accessible, and visually integrated into the site’s design. This is where Bootstrap’s form components become valuable, offering a balance between aesthetics and functionality.\n\nBootstrap forms stand out for their responsiveness and ease of integration. With Bootstrap, forms are automatically styled with a professional look and feel. These forms are responsive by design, meaning they adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and resolutions.\n\nThe framework offers various form controls, including input fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and more. The responsiveness of Bootstrap forms ensures that they remain functional and visually appealing, regardless of the viewing context. This adaptability is essential for creating inclusive web experiences that cater to all users, regardless of their device preferences.\n\nIntegrating Bootstrap into your project is the first step toward using its full potential for creating responsive and attractive forms.\n\nTo start using Bootstrap in your project, you need to include it. There are mainly two ways to do this:\n• None Using a Content Delivery Network (CDN): This is the simplest method. You include links to Bootstrap’s CSS and JS files in your HTML file’s head section. It looks something like this:\n• None Downloading and Hosting Locally: Alternatively, you can download Bootstrap and include the files directly in your project. This is a good choice if you want to customize Bootstrap’s components at a deeper level or if you prefer to have everything hosted within your project.\n\nOnce Bootstrap is included in your project, you can start building your form. Here’s the basic structure of a Bootstrap form:\n\n1. Form Tag: Start with the <form> element. This is standard HTML, but you’ll be adding Bootstrap classes for styling.\n\n2. Form Groups: Inside the form, use the .form-group class to ensure proper spacing of labels and form controls.\n\n3. Labels and Inputs: Include a <label> and an <input> element for each field in your form. Bootstrap enhances these with classes like .form-control for inputs. This class applies styling and ensures responsive behavior.\n\n4. Buttons: Finally, add a submit button. Bootstrap’s .btn classes can be used here to style the button.\n\nPutting it all together, here’s what we come up with.\n\nBootstrap forms are highly customizable, allowing you to add various form elements like checkboxes, radio buttons, select menus, and more. Each of these elements comes with its own specific Bootstrap classes for enhanced styling and functionality.\n\nBootstrap also offers various types of form layouts to cater to different design needs. So let’s explore these types, namely Inline Forms, Horizontal Forms, and Vertical Forms.\n\nInline Forms in Bootstrap are designed for situations where you want to display form controls in a single line. This type of form is ideal for creating compact forms, often used for search bars or quick login fields. Here’s how you can create an Inline Form:\n\nIn this example, the row-cols-lg-auto class is used to align the form controls and labels side by side.\n\nHorizontal Forms are used when you want to align form labels and controls in the same row but in a more structured and aligned manner. This layout is often used for detailed forms where a clear separation between the label and the control is needed.\n\nIn this code, the row class and grid system are used to align labels and fields horizontally.\n\nVertical Forms are the default style in Bootstrap and are the most common form layouts used in various applications. In this layout, each label and control is stacked on top of one another.\n\nThe vertical form is straightforward, where the form-group class is used to maintain optimal spacing around the form elements.\n\nEach of these form types serves different design and usability purposes, and Bootstrap makes it easy to implement them with its pre-defined classes and grid system.\n\nBootstrap’s form controls are like the building blocks for creating interactive and user-friendly web forms. So let’s overview Bootstrap’s form controls (the key ones): Input Types, Textarea, Checkboxes and Radios, and Select Options.\n\nBootstrap enhances standard HTML input types with styles and functionalities. These include text, email, password, and more. Each input type is used for collecting different kinds of user data.\n\nExample of various input types in Bootstrap:\n\nIn each case, the form-control class is used to style the inputs consistently.\n\nA textarea is used for multi-line text input, such as comments or messages. Thus, Bootstrap’s styling for textareas ensures they are visually consistent with other form controls.\n\nCheckboxes and radio buttons are used for selecting one or more options from a set. Bootstrap styles these controls for better usability and appearance.\n\nSelect options are dropdown lists that allow users to choose one option from many. Bootstrap styles these to be consistent with other form elements.\n\nIn each of these examples, Bootstrap classes are applied to ensure that the form controls are not only functional but also visually integrated and responsive.\n\nBootstrap also includes additional classes to customize the appearance of your form fields. For example, you can make the input field smaller or larger depending on your preference. So here are some additional customization classes to try out.\n\nBootstrap provides various classes to style form controls. There are various form control styles you can consider as well. For example, the form-control-lg and form-control-sm classes adjust the size of the input fields. Here is an example:\n\nBootstrap includes styles for validation states with feedback messages. This helps in providing immediate contextual feedback to users. Here is an example implementation.\n\nYou’ll need to use JavaScript to control the state of the input element such that the validation messages show up only when there is an error. To learn more, check out the video below.\n\nThese input elements do not allow user input in the field. Although they prevent user interactions, their functionalities differ.\n\nTo visually indicate that a form field is not interactive, you can use the disabled attribute on input fields. For read-only inputs, you’ll need to apply the readonly attribute on the input element. Here is an example with both types of input.\n\nThe main difference between both of them is that read-only inputs can still be focused and selected, while disabled inputs cannot. Here is a preview of the code example above.\n\nThe table below explains the differences between both input types in detail.\n\nInput groups wrap input elements with additional text or buttons. This is useful for adding contextual addons to form fields. You can add an element or icon before and after the input field using the prepend and append Bootstrap classes. Here is an example.\n\nIn this example, input-group-append adds contextual text to the input field after the element. The input-group-prepend class adds contextual texts or icons before the input element.\n\nBootstrap’s grid system is a powerful tool for creating responsive and structured layouts in web forms. Let’s delve into how you can use this system for form layout and the considerations for responsive form design.\n\nUsing the Bootstrap Grid System for Form Layout\n\nBootstrap’s grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content. It’s based on a 12-column structure which can be combined in various ways to create different types of layouts.\n\nHere’s how you can use it in forms:\n\nIn this example, we divided the form into two columns, each occupying half of the available space. This layout is responsive, meaning it will adjust based on the screen size.\n\nWhen designing forms with the Bootstrap grid system, it’s crucial to consider how they will adjust to different screen sizes. Bootstrap’s grid classes (col-xs-, col-sm-, col-md-, col-lg-, col-xl-) allow you to specify how forms should behave on various devices. Here is an example.\n\nIn this example, the email and password fields are displayed side by side on medium-sized devices and larger (col-md-6). On smaller screens, these fields stack vertically for better readability and usability.\n• None Stacking on Smaller Screens: Ensure form elements stack vertically on smaller screens for easy readability and interaction.\n• None Column Sizing: Use different column sizes (col-xs-, col-sm-, etc.) to control how much space each form element occupies on various devices.\n• None Alignment and Spacing: Utilize Bootstrap’s spacing and alignment classes to ensure that your form looks balanced and is easy to use on all screen sizes.\n\nAdding JavaScript to your form allows for dynamic behaviors and enhanced interactivity, which can significantly improve the user experience. Let’s explore two key aspects: implementing dynamic form behaviors like show/hide elements, and handling form submissions.\n\nUsing JavaScript, you can dynamically show or hide form elements based on user actions or inputs. This is useful in cases where you want to display additional fields based on certain selections.\n\nLet’s create a form with a checkbox field that, when checked, shows an additional text input field. For this, add the code below to your HTML template.\n\nNext, add the JavaScript code below to your JS file.\n\nIn this example, the extra input field is initially hidden. When the checkbox is checked, the extra field is shown, and when unchecked, it is hidden again.\n\nHandling form submissions with JavaScript in a Bootstrap context allows you to intercept the submit event, validate the form data, and potentially submit the data asynchronously using AJAX.\n\nHere’s how you can handle a form submission:\n\nIn this example, the default form submission is prevented to allow for custom processing. You can then collect form data and, if required, use AJAX to submit the data to a server without reloading the page.\n\nCheck out the video below to learn more bout handling form submissions in HTML.\n\nAccessibility in web forms ensures that all users, including those with disabilities, can use them effectively.\n• None Use of ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) Attributes: Incorporate ARIA roles and attributes to make forms more accessible. For instance, aria-label, aria-labelledby, and aria-describedby can provide context to screen readers.\n• None Labeling Form Elements: Always use <label> for each input field. For visually hidden labels (e.g., when using icon buttons), use class .sr-only to hide labels in a way that keeps them readable by screen readers.\n• None Ensuring Keyboard Navigation: Make sure that all form controls are accessible using the keyboard. This is crucial for users who rely on keyboard navigation.\n• None Error Identification: Identify and describe errors in form submission. Use alert roles like role=”alert” for error messages to ensure they are announced by screen readers.\n\nMaintaining a consistent design across all forms within a website or application is crucial for user experience.\n• None Consistent Layout and Styling: Use a consistent layout pattern (e.g., label alignment, button sizes) across all forms. Bootstrap’s grid system can help maintain layout consistency.\n• None Theming: Customize Bootstrap’s default theme to match your brand or site’s color scheme, typography, and other design elements.\n• None Responsive Design: Ensure forms are responsive and look good on all devices. Bootstrap’s responsive utilities should be utilized to achieve this.\n• None Feedback and States: Consistently use feedback indicators (like colors for success or error states) across all forms. Bootstrap’s form validation states and classes can be used for this.\n\nBelow, we’ve answered the most common questions about creating forms with Bootstrap.\n\nA Bootstrap form is a web form created using Bootstrap classes, a popular front-end framework. Bootstrap forms are designed to be responsive and visually appealing. They utilize HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript, offering various styles and components like input fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc.\n\nHow Do I Make My Bootstrap Form Responsive?\n\nUsing Bootstrap’s built-in classes like form-control automatically adds responsiveness to your form elements. However, you can use Bootstrap’s predefined grid classes to customize the layout of your form. Doing so ensures that your form elements will adjust to different screen sizes.\n\nHow Does Form Validation Work in Bootstrap?\n\nBootstrap form validation is implemented using HTML5 and CSS. It provides visual feedback on the validation state of form elements. When a user submits a form, Bootstrap adds various CSS classes to invalid fields, such as is-invalid, displaying validation feedback messages. For custom validation logic, you might use JavaScript alongside Bootstrap’s styling.\n\nHow to get data from Bootstrap form?\n\nTo get data from a Bootstrap form, use standard HTML and JavaScript methods. Upon form submission, you can access the data from each form control either by using the FormData object or by accessing each element individually through its name or id. For example:\n\nHow to use Bootstrap in react form?\n\nTo use Bootstrap in a React form, you can include Bootstrap’s CSS in your React project. This can be done by importing the Bootstrap CSS file into your main JavaScript file. For example:\n\nThen, use Bootstrap’s classes within your React components as usual. For more interactive elements, like modals or dropdowns, you might use libraries like react-bootstrap or reactstrap that reimplement Bootstrap components as React components.\n\nMost modern web applications include forms for collecting input from users. It has numerous use cases such as handling user registration, authentication, or user feedback forms.\n\nIn this tutorial, we’ve shown you how to use the Form components provided by Bootstrap.
