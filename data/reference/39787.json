This video is from our complete Word tutorial, titled “Mastering Word Made Easy v.2019 and 365.”\n\nYou can adjust row height and column width in Word tables using the mouse. To do this, place your mouse pointer over the border of the column or row to adjust. When you are in the correct place, the mouse pointer turns into a double-line with an intersecting arrow. At that point, you then click and drag to adjust the column width or row height.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use the commands in the “Cell Size” button group on the table’s “Layout” contextual tab in the Ribbon to adjust row height and column width in Word tables. To do this, first select the cells whose width or height you wish to adjust. Then use the “Height:” and “Width:” spinner boxes to set the height and the width of the selected cells.\n\nYou can also use the “AutoFit” button to apply automatic adjustments to selected cells. To do this, first select the cells to automatically adjust. Then click the “AutoFit” button in the “Cell Size” button group on the table’s “Layout” contextual tab in the Ribbon. Then select the method of adjustment to apply: “AutoFit Contents,” which resizes the cells to fit their content; “AutoFit Window,” which stretches the table across the page to fit the window; or “Fixed Column Width,” which lets you set the widths of the columns by hand using the techniques you just learned.\n\nAdjust Row Height and Column Width in Word Tables- Instructions: A picture of a table in Word being adjusted by using the “AutoFit” button in the “Layout” tab of the “Table Tools” contextual tab in the Ribbon of Word.\n\nAnother way to adjust row height or column width in Word tables is to equally distribute the spacing allocated to a selection of rows or columns. For example, if you had three adjacent columns of unequal sizes in a table, you could select them and then resize them so each one was the same width over the selected area. To do this, select the columns or rows to evenly distribute. Then click either the “Distribute Rows” or “Distribute Columns” button in the “Cell Size” button group on the table’s “Layout” contextual tab in the Ribbon to distribute the selected columns or rows equally over the selected area.\n• To adjust row height and column width in Word tables by using the mouse, place the mouse pointer over the border of the column or row to adjust until the mouse pointer turns into a double line with an intersecting arrow.\n• Then click and drag to adjust the column width or row height.\n• To adjust cell sizes by using the buttons within the table’s “Layout” contextual tab in the Ribbon, select the cells whose height and width you want to adjust.\n• Then click table’s “Layout” contextual tab in the Ribbon to display the “Cell Size” button group.\n• Use the “Height:” and “Width:” spinner boxes in the “Cell Size” button group to set the height and width of the selected cells.\n• To apply automatic adjustments to selected cells, select the table cells to adjust.\n• Then click the “AutoFit” button in the “Cell Size” button group on the table’s “Layout” contextual tab in the Ribbon.\n• Then select an option button for either “AutoFit Contents,” which resizes the cells to fit their content; “AutoFit Window,” which stretches the table across the page to fit the window; or “Fixed Column Width,” which lets you set the widths of the columns by hand, as shown in step #1.\n• To equally distribute the spacing allocated to a selection of rows or columns, select the rows or columns to equally distribute in your table.\n• Then click the table’s “Layout” contextual tab in the Ribbon.\n• Then click either the “Distribute Rows” or “Distribute Columns” button in the “Cell Size” button group, as desired.\n• Your selected rows or columns are then evenly distributed over the selected area."

        "document": "How To Copy an Excel Table Into Word in 5 Steps\n\nWord and Excel are two common programs individuals and businesses use to create spreadsheets and process documents. Sometimes, you might copy data from one program to another, but you still need to maintain the integrity of that data. Understanding how to copy a table from Excel into Word can help you ensure you're copying exactly what you need in the correct style or formatting. In this article, we explain how to copy an Excel table into Microsoft Word and explore some of the reasons you might copy data.\n\nHow to copy an Excel table into Word\n\nHere are five steps on how to copy an Excel table into Word:\n\nDetermine which table in your Excel document you want to copy into a Word document. Excel typically arranges data in cells, which are individual rectangular areas where you can add, edit and delete numbers or letters. If you're copying multiple cells, it's important to verify the information in each cell to ensure you're copying everything you need. Review the information in each cell before you highlight it for copying. An Excel document in \"Read only\" mode may not allow copy and paste options, so check to see if you're in \"Editing\" mode.\n\nWhen you determine what you're copying from your Excel sheet, you can click your mouse on one of your corner cells and drag it across the entirety of the cells you want to copy. Click and drag your mouse until you've highlighted each cell. They typically turn blue once you highlight them. If you only want to copy one cell, you can simply click the individual cell. If you want to copy information directly from the cell without formatting, double-click inside the cell to highlight just the information within.\n\n3. Select the \"Home\" tab in Excel and copy\n\nOnce you highlight the table you're copying into Word, you can navigate to the \"Home\" tab in the top left corner of your Excel spreadsheet. The \"Home\" tab contains options for saving, editing and sending files. Under this tab, you can see two options: \"Cut\" and \"Copy.\" There is also a \"Copy as picture\" option that allows you to copy your selected cells in a .jpeg or .png format as a static image. Navigate to the copy option and click it once.\n\n4. Navigate to your Word document and choose a paste option\n\nOnce you've highlighted and copied your cells, you're ready to navigate to your Word document and paste the information. Open your document and click inside one of your pages until you see the cursor. Navigate to the home tab in the top left corner and look for the \"Paste\" command. The paste command has a drop-down menu, which allows a few different options for pasting images, text and cells from an Excel document:\n• None Using the paste command copies information exactly from the document.\n• None This option allows you to keep the original formatting from the source.\n• None This option merges the original formatting with your document's formatting, creating a consistent format for the document.\n• None This option allows you to paste your content as text only, with no table or other formatting.\n\nYou can use the simple paste command or keep source formatting command to ensure you're copying the entire table into your document. Merge formatting and text only commands typically don't create a table and instead paste the text into your cells.\n\n5. Paste your table and review for formatting and data integrity\n\nOnce you decide how to paste your content, click the paste button and review your information for integrity. Sometimes, errors can occur in the copying process that change the way your table looks or performs in Word. Review your data and resize your table as necessary. You can delete, add and edit cells within your table in Word, but it might be easier to edit in Excel and perform another copy and paste command because it can be easier to edit tables in Excel.\n\nWho uses Excel and Word?\n\nExcel and Word are common word and information processing programs. Many professionals use them for various reasons. Here are some common examples:\n• None Copywriters often use word processors to create, edit and collaborate on documents and create written content.\n• None Many accountants use Excel to track and manage financial information, using Excel's advanced formulas to create mathematical commands.\n• None Data scientists may use spreadsheets to organize and interpret large sets of data or to use the advanced mathematical functions that a spreadsheet can provide.\n• None Many college and high school students use both of these programs to write papers, track information and collaborate on school projects.\n• None Some people use these programs to create personal notes, write stories or even track personal expenses and plan budgets. Excel can integrate with various Some people use these programs to create personal notes, write stories or even track personal expenses and plan budgets. Excel can integrate with various bookkeeping programs.\n\nWhen to copy a table into Word\n\nYou might copy a table into Word for a variety of reasons. If you're creating a report, you might organize numerical data in Excel first to create a more consistent format before copying the information into your report, or you might copy a table to add visual information to your Word document. Some people use the copy and paste function to share spreadsheets with others who don't have access to Excel or other spreadsheet programs.\n\nTips for using tables in Word\n\nUsing tables in Word can enhance a document or presentation or convey information in a more readable way. Here are some tips for using tables in Word:\n• None If you include large numerical data sets in a document or report, using a table can be a great way to more efficiently organize that data and make it more accessible for the readers.\n• None Sometimes, a chart can help portray the information in a table more effectively. Consider using charts alongside your tables for a different way to interpret the data you provide.\n• None When you copy and paste from Excel, you might find your table format changes. Keep formatting consistent in your document to create a more professional, organized look.\n• None If you don't have access to spreadsheets or aren't familiar with using them, consider using the \"Insert table\" function in Word as an alternative to copying a table from Excel.\n\nPlease note that none of the companies mentioned in this article are affiliated with Indeed."
