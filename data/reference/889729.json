Drag the modified .bin files on the zip file, to repack them (use WinRAR for this)6. Use the \"CRC fix\" to \"fix\" the DataEn.pak file, so the game uses it and doesn't throw an error.Like this (the original DataEn.pak and DataEn.zip have to be in the same directory!):Gibbed.DeadIsland.FixZip.exe -v -o \"DataEn.pak\" \"DataEn.zip\" \"DataEn_modified.pak\"7.

        "document": "So Techland, in their infinite wisdom, decided to disable modding for the game out of concerns of \"cheating.\" It's a dumb move in my opinion, so I've done some work to try and re-enable Dying Light Modding.\n\nBasically, the problem is that the game used to read files from the My Documents/DyingLight directory and runs them over the .pak files in its own SteamApps\\common\\Dying Light\\DW directory. Since the .pak files in the DyingLight steam directory were simply renamed .zip files, you could make all sorts of changes that allowed people to customize the game as they would. Most of these changes were the result of editing files located in Data0.pak.\n\nSince the most recent patch none of this works. However, theoretically there's nothing stopping people from just replacing the .pak files in SteamApps\\common\\Dying Light\\DW with their own, edited files.\n\nTo do so isn't too hard, but I've run into a stumbling block and am hoping to crowdsource some help.\n\nI'm using the legit steam version for reference.\n\nSo here's what you need to do to start with.\n• Unzip Data0.pak to its own folder using 7zip or WinRar. Let's call this folder Data0Modified.\n• Modify whatever files you want to modify to change gameplay features, remove film grain and chromatic aberration, et cetera. Do not delete any other file\n• Highlight all the files and folders in Data0Modified and put them in a ZIP archive. Let's call this new archive Data0Modified.zip\n\nNow, the next logical step would be to back up the initial Data0.pak, take Data0Modified.zip and rename it Data0.pak instead (remembering that it contains your modified files!) and launch the game like usual.\n\nUnfortunately, it's not so simple.\n\nWhen you first launch Dying Light from Steam, it checks the crc of the .pak files to ensure that they aren't corrupt.\n\nThis means that you can't just rename a .zip file Data0.pak and have it work out of the box. Fortunately, there's a solution.\n\nGibbed made a program for repaking files for the original dead island: I've linked it below:\n\nExtract this program to its own folder, let's call it CRC Fix. Copy the vanilla Data0.pak from the Dying Light steam directory to CRC Fix. Also copy your Data0Modified.zip to CRC Fix. This program will 'fix' the your modified Data0.pak's crc so the game will use it and not throw an error. For instructions on how to use it, the program comes with a readme. I'll summarize:\n\nOpen a command prompt in the CRC Fix folder (If you don't know how to do this there are lots of articles off of google\n\nType the following into the command prompt:\n\nThat will create an output file titled Data0modified.pak, with a crc fixed so Dying Light can read it. The only thing left to do is rename Data0Modified.pak Data0.pak and put it in SteamApps\\common\\Dying Light\\DW. Make sure to back up the original Data0.pak first. Now the game boots perfectly fine.\n\nEven though the CRC is fixed, Dying Light is still going to throw a hissy fit when you try to load your saved game, complaining about DLC not being present. The same will occur if you try to play online, or even start a new game. At the moment I have next to no idea how to continue, how to force the game to run a game in the first place with the modded files. If you have any idea, please comment below.\n• Extract Data0.pak using 7zip or winrar to its own directory\"\n• Make your changes in the extracted files without deleting anything.\n• Recompress the extracted files into a zip archive, call it Data0Modified.zip\n• Download the CRC Fixer, place Data0.pak and Data0Modified.zip in the same folder as the fixzip exe\n• Open up a command prompt and run the following command:\n• Rename the output file Data0.pak and put it in the Dying Light directory\n• Save games will not work and you can't play until this is fixed.\n• Hope someone comes up with a solution that fixes the problem and allows data file editing."

        "document": "​Back when Techland released The Following DLC, they changed a lot of things that made all or most changes to the AI files to no longer be recognized by the game. (This is what essentially destroyed the widely-used I Am Legion mod by TheOneAndOnlyHitman)\n\nI don't think anything has changed and any changes in most AI files are still unrecognized. I haven't done anything with AI since then, so there may be a way still to only increase the bite damage only.\n\nHowever, you can increase all damage received from biters (of all attacks from them, not just bites) if you instead want to go the route of altering the 'data\\scripts\\difficultyparams.scr' file.\n\nIn each 'Difficulty' section (East, Normal, Hard, Nightmare) you will find variables for increasing or decreasing the damage that you inflict on and receive from each type of infected.\n\nThere is a note in this file on the sections explaining them a little:\n\nFirst find the difficulty you are playing in and then go to its damage section.\n\nYou will see something like this for changing the damage you inflict on different infected types in that difficulty:\n\nAlso note that any this difficultyparams.scr file is just like most of the skills files where Techland does not like mods changing them while the game is set or running in Online mode. They'll use their PLS system (the temporary event system) to force unmodified version to be downloaded and used over your modified one.\n\nEither disable event participation, run the game in offline mode, or include the 'data\\restclient.scr' file in your Data3.pak file with the whole file push system disabled in it by changing this setting on line 8 in the file from:\n\nIncluding this file with the file push system disabled may even help with your modified AI files if Techland is forcing unmodified AI file versions to be downloaded and used over your modified ones. I'm not sure if they prevent modification to those files internally in game code or externally via this file override system."
