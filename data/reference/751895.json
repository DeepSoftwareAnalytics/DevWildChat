        "document": "Ansible Vault is a feature of ansible that allows you to keep sensitive data such as passwords or keys in encrypted files, rather than as plaintext in playbooks or roles. These vault files can then be distributed or placed in source control.\n\nTo enable this feature, a command line tool - ansible-vault - is used to edit files, and a command line flag ( , or ) is used. Alternately, you may specify the location of a password file or command Ansible to always prompt for the password in your ansible.cfg file. These options require no command line flag usage.\n\nFor best practices advice, refer to Variables and Vaults.\n\nWhat Can Be Encrypted With Vault¶ Ansible Vault can encrypt any structured data file used by Ansible. This can include “group_vars/” or “host_vars/” inventory variables, variables loaded by “include_vars” or “vars_files”, or variable files passed on the ansible-playbook command line with or . Role variables and defaults are also included. Ansible tasks, handlers, and so on are also data so these can be encrypted with vault as well. To hide the names of variables that you’re using, you can encrypt the task files in their entirety. Ansible Vault can also encrypt arbitrary files, even binary files. If a vault-encrypted file is given as the argument to the copy, template, unarchive, script or assemble modules, the file will be placed at the destination on the target host decrypted (assuming a valid vault password is supplied when running the play). The advantages of file-level encryption are that it is easy to use and that password rotation is straightforward with rekeying. The drawback is that the contents of files are no longer easy to access and read. This may be problematic if it is a list of tasks (when encrypting a variables file, best practice is to keep references to these variables in a non-encrypted file). Ansible also supports encrypting single values inside a YAML file, using the tag to let YAML and Ansible know it uses special processing. This feature is covered in more detail below. The advantage of variable-level encryption is that files are still easily legible even if they mix plaintext and encrypted variables. The drawback is that password rotation is not as simple as with file-level encryption: the rekey command does not work with this method.\n\nA vault ID is an identifier for one or more vault secrets; Ansible supports multiple vault passwords. To use vault IDs, you must provide an ID label of your choosing and a source to obtain its password (either or a file path): This switch is available for all Ansible commands that can interact with vaults: ansible-vault, ansible-playbook, etc. Vault-encrypted content can specify which vault ID it was encrypted with. For example, a playbook can now include a vars file encrypted with a ‘dev’ vault ID and a ‘prod’ vault ID.\n\nTo create a new encrypted data file, run the following command: First you will be prompted for a password. After providing a password, the tool will launch whatever editor you have defined with $EDITOR, and defaults to vi. Once you are done with the editor session, the file will be saved as encrypted data. The default cipher is AES (which is shared-secret based). To create a new encrypted data file with the Vault ID ‘password1’ assigned to it and be prompted for the password, run:\n\nShould you wish to change your password on a vault-encrypted file or files, you can do so with the rekey command: This command can rekey multiple data files at once and will ask for the original password and also the new password. To rekey files encrypted with the ‘preprod2’ vault ID and the ‘ppold’ file and be prompted for the new password: A different ID could have been set for the rekeyed files by passing it to .\n\nIf you have existing files that you wish to encrypt, use the ansible-vault encrypt command. This command can operate on multiple files at once: To encrypt existing files with the ‘project’ ID and be prompted for the password: It is technically possible to separately encrypt files or strings with the same vault ID but different passwords, if different password files or prompted passwords are provided each time. This could be desirable if you use vault IDs as references to classes of passwords (rather than a single password) and you always know which specific password or file to use in context. However this may be an unnecessarily complex use-case. If two files are encrypted with the same vault ID but different passwords by accident, you can use the rekey command to fix the issue.\n\nWhen all data is encrypted using a single password the or cli options should be used. For example, to use a password store in the text file : To get the password from a vault password executable script : The config option DEFAULT_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE can be used to specify a vault password file so that the cli option does not have to be specified every time. Since Ansible 2.4 the can be used to indicate which vault ID (‘dev’, ‘prod’, ‘cloud’, etc) a password is for as well as how to source the password (prompt, a file path, etc). By default the vault-id label is only a hint, any values encrypted with the password will be decrypted. The config option DEFAULT_VAULT_ID_MATCH can be set to require the vault id to match the vault ID used when the value was encrypted. This can reduce errors when different values are encrypted with different passwords. For example, to use a password file for the vault-id ‘dev’: To prompt for the password for the ‘dev’ vault ID: To get the ‘dev’ vault ID password from an executable script : The config option DEFAULT_VAULT_IDENTITY_LIST can be used to specify a default vault ID and password source so that the cli option does not have to be specified every time. The option can also be used without specifying a vault-id. This behaviour is equivalent to or so is rarely used. For example, to use a password file : To prompt for the password: To get the password from an executable script : Prior to Ansible 2.4, the option is not supported so or must be used. Ansible 2.4 and later support using multiple vault passwords, can be provided multiple times. For example, to use a ‘dev’ password read from a file and to be prompted for the ‘prod’ password: By default the vault ID labels (dev, prod etc.) are only hints, Ansible will attempt to decrypt vault content with each password. The password with the same label as the encrypted data will be tried first, after that each vault secret will be tried in the order they were provided on the command line. Where the encrypted data doesn’t have a label, or the label doesn’t match any of the provided labels, the passwords will be tried in the order they are specified. In the above case, the ‘dev’ password will be tried first, then the ‘prod’ password for cases where Ansible doesn’t know which vault ID is used to encrypt something. To add a vault ID label to the encrypted data use the option with a label when encrypting the data. The DEFAULT_VAULT_ID_MATCH config option can be set so that Ansible will only use the password with the same label as the encrypted data. This is more efficient and may be more predictable when multiple passwords are used. The config option DEFAULT_VAULT_IDENTITY_LIST can have multiple values which is equivalent to multiple cli options. The can be used in lieu of the or options, or it can be used in combination with them. When using ansible-vault commands that encrypt content (ansible-vault encrypt, ansible-vault encrypt_string, etc) only one vault-id can be used.\n\nWhen implementing a script to obtain a vault password it may be convenient to know which vault ID label was requested. For example a script loading passwords from a secret manager may want to use the vault ID label to pick either the ‘dev’ or ‘prod’ password. Since Ansible 2.5 this is supported through the use of Client Scripts. A Client Script is an executable script with a name ending in . Client Scripts are used to obtain vault passwords in the same way as any other executable script. For example: The difference is in the implementation of the script. Client Scripts are executed with a option so they know which vault ID label was requested. So the above Ansible execution results in the below execution of the Client Script: is an example of Client Script that loads passwords from the system keyring.\n\nThe header contains the vault format id, the vault format version, the vault cipher, and a vault-id label (with format version 1.2), separated by semi-colons ‘;’ The first field is the format id. Currently is the only valid file format id. This is used to identify files that are vault encrypted (via vault.is_encrypted_file()). The second field ( ) is the vault format version. All supported versions of ansible will currently default to ‘1.1’ or ‘1.2’ if a labeled vault-id is supplied. The ‘1.0’ format is supported for reading only (and will be converted automatically to the ‘1.1’ format on write). The format version is currently used as an exact string compare only (version numbers are not currently ‘compared’). The third field ( ) identifies the cipher algorithm used to encrypt the data. Currently, the only supported cipher is ‘AES256’. [vault format 1.0 used ‘AES’, but current code always uses ‘AES256’] The fourth field ( ) identifies the vault-id label used to encrypt the data. For example using a vault-id of results in a vault-id-label of ‘dev’ being used. Note: In the future, the header could change. Anything after the vault id and version can be considered to depend on the vault format version. This includes the cipher id, and any additional fields that could be after that. The rest of the content of the file is the ‘vaulttext’. The vaulttext is a text armored version of the encrypted ciphertext. Each line will be 80 characters wide, except for the last line which may be shorter."

It allows users to encrypt secrets and other sensitive data, such as API keys, passwords, and other credentials, to protect them at rest. Ansible Vault is designed to work with YAML files, but it can encrypt any type of text-based file. Instead of storing secrets in plaintext, Ansible Vault provides a secure, native, and low-effort option for managing sensitive information by leveraging encryption.

Users are responsible for not exposing decrypted content in the console or in any other way. If necessary, check out the option for tasks to hide their output.\n\nPasswords are required to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data with Ansible Vault. They are used to create encrypted variables or files, decrypt, and view or edit the encrypted content. To supply the password for these operations, you can either leverage the command and get prompted for it, set up a location of a password file in your main configuration definition, , or integrate with an external secret store solution that holds your passwords. There is a password management process for each of these cases. For simple cases, small teams, and a few encrypted values, you might leverage the same password for all your encrypted content. This approach simplifies your password management process because you only have to deal with a single password. You should store and handle this password and other sensitive data in your secret management system. You might have to create and manage more vault passwords for complex systems and different access levels for different teams and people. For example, you might use a different password per team, per environment, per ansible role, application, directory, or any other pattern that fits your needs. In such cases, you can specify a dedicated vault ID for every password. Whenever you generate newly encrypted content, you can pass the dedicated ID with the flag . Store this ID along with the password and pass it with the password during decryption. We will explore more examples of leveraging vault IDs in the section on how to encrypt sensitive values. Where to store your Ansible Vault passwords? As discussed previously, storing passwords in a local file is a simple but not very secure option. If you decide to use this option, make sure the file has the correct permissions, store the password as a string in a single line, and don’t persist it in any code repositories. A more secure and scalable way is to use an external secret store for storing passwords and fetch them dynamically with the help of a vault password client script. A vault password client script is responsible for connecting to the remote secret store, fetching the secret, and printing the password to standard output. Check out the official documentation’s section on storing passwords in third-party tools with Vault password client scripts for details on how to create and use such scripts.\n• How to Manage Ansible More Securely\n\nHow to use ansible-vault command to encrypt sensitive data Ansible Vault can help users encrypt mainly two types of data — variables and files. This means we can encrypt either whole files or only specific values stored in encrypted variables. Encrypting specific variables means content will be decrypted on demand only when needed. This option allows us to mix encrypted and plaintext content as required inside playbooks and roles. One drawback of this approach is that it works only with variables and that changing or rotating the password might be cumbersome because there is no command to support this. On the other hand, encrypting whole files allows us to encrypt other content (tasks, for example) apart from variables, with decryption happening when the file is referenced. We can easily use the command to change or rotate the password used for file encryption. In general, file-level encryption is easier to use and manage. A disadvantage of this approach is that encrypting the whole content of the files reduces readability and accessibility because it’s difficult to read the file and understand its contents. One way to bypass this issue is to keep the names or references of your encrypted content in a separate, non-encrypted file. For more information on the topic, see Keep vaulted variables safely visible. Let’s look at some examples. We will start by encrypting a variable. To encrypt a string to use in an Ansible variable, you can leverage the command. The syntax is: Let’s encrypt the string named and provide the password via the command line: Notice that the encrypted content produced starts with the tag, which indicates to Ansible that this value is encrypted and needs decryption to use. After this tag, Ansible adds a header before the encrypted content that includes the format ID, the vault format version, and the cipher algorithm used for encryption. If you create the encrypted variable with a vault ID, this is also included in the generated content. If you are interested in more information, check out the format of files created with Ansible Vault section of the official docs. You can also select the password source. For example, let’s use a file named as our password source. To avoid persisting the secret value in your shell history, don’t pass directly with the command, but opt to be prompted for a string to encrypt like this: You can find more command options by using the flag. To encrypt whole files that include structured data, you can leverage the or the commands. Different encryptable files include group, host, defaults, roles, and other custom variable files, tasks files, handlers files, binary, or other arbitrary files. To create a new encrypted file with Ansible Vault, use: Enter a password when prompted, add your content in the editor, save, and exit. The file will be encrypted automatically. For example, let’s create a new encrypted file, , with vault ID dev, and get prompted for the password, use this command: This will open your configured editor (by default, vi) to provide the content to be encrypted. The considerations for storing and using Ansible Vault passwords discussed earlier also apply here. After you provide your plain text content to the file and save and exit from it, you will only see the encrypted version when you try to view the content. You will need to decrypt it to view it in plain text again. To encrypt an existing file with Ansible Vault, use: This will prompt you to set a password for encryption. Once completed, the file will be encrypted and its contents secured. Before encrypting this example existing file, let’s take a look at its content: Next, let’s encrypt it. This operation is as simple as running this command: You will be prompted for a password, which is required for the decrypt operation. Now if we want to check the content of the file, this is what we will see:\n\nUsing Ansible Vault to work with encrypted content In the previous section, we explained the process and reviewed several options for encrypting different content with Ansible Vault. Now, let’s look at how we can utilize and work with encrypted content. One of the most common user operations is to view the encrypted content if necessary. You can leverage the debug module to view the plaintext value of encrypted content. Let’s create a simple encrypted variable and pass the password via the prompt: Next, we store this variable in a file named . To view the encrypted value, use the module and pass the location of the password as we have seen earlier: Viewing the contents of encrypted files without decrypting them permanently is quite simple with the command: Another handy option when working with encrypted files is the ability to edit the encrypted content with the command: This command prompts the user for the password, decrypts the content to a temporary file, allows the user to edit the encrypted content with the configured editor, and finally saves and re-encrypts the file. To permanently decrypt an encrypted file, use the command. You will need to provide the encryption password: Now if we go back and check the content of that file, it will be human-readable again: --- - name: Install htop hosts: all become: yes tasks: - name: Update apt cache apt: update_cache: yes - name: Install htop apt: name: htop state: present Note: After running the command, the file will be permanently decrypted. If you want to temporarily view or use the contents, consider using instead. Make sure you handle decrypted files securely to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information. Another common operation is to rotate or change the password used for encryption. As discussed briefly in the previous section, this can be achieved with the command. To change the password for an encrypted file, use the command below, and pass the current and the new password when prompted: You will need to provide the old password and then provide a new password and confirm it for this to work. When you need to decrypt content from a playbook with encrypted variables that have been created with different passwords and vault IDs, pass multiple flags when executing the playbook. If you use a specific vault ID or a password source more frequently than others, you can define default options and avoid passing them every time. Leverage DEFAULT_VAULT_DENY_LIST and DEFAULT_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE to set this up.\n\nHow Spacelift can help you with Ansible projects Spacelift’s vibrant ecosystem and excellent GitOps flow can greatly assist you in managing and orchestrating Ansible.

        "document": "Once you have a strategy for managing and storing vault passwords, you can start encrypting content. You can encrypt two types of content with Ansible Vault: variables and files. Encrypted content always includes the tag, which tells Ansible and YAML that the content needs to be decrypted, and a character, which allows multi-line strings. Encrypted content created with also contains the vault ID label. For more details about the encryption process and the format of content encrypted with Ansible Vault, see Format of files encrypted with Ansible Vault. This table shows the main differences between encrypted variables and encrypted files:\n\nYou can encrypt single values inside a YAML file using the ansible-vault encrypt_string command. For one way to keep your vaulted variables safely visible, see Keep vaulted variables safely visible. With variable-level encryption, your files are still easily legible. You can mix plaintext and encrypted variables, even inline in a play or role. However, password rotation is not as simple as with file-level encryption. You cannot rekey encrypted variables. Also, variable-level encryption only works on variables. If you want to encrypt tasks or other content, you must encrypt the entire file. The ansible-vault encrypt_string command encrypts and formats any string you type (or copy or generate) into a format that can be included in a playbook, role, or variables file. To create a basic encrypted variable, pass three options to the ansible-vault encrypt_string command:\n• None a source for the vault password (prompt, file, or script, with or without a vault ID)\n• None the string name (the name of the variable) The pattern looks like this: For example, to encrypt the string ‘foobar’ using the only password stored in ‘a_password_file’ and name the variable ‘the_secret’: The command above creates this content: To encrypt the string ‘foooodev’, add the vault ID label ‘dev’ with the ‘dev’ vault password stored in ‘a_password_file’, and call the encrypted variable ‘the_dev_secret’: The command above creates this content: To encrypt the string ‘letmein’ read from stdin, add the vault ID ‘dev’ using the ‘dev’ vault password stored in , and name the variable ‘db_password’: Typing secret content directly at the command line (without a prompt) leaves the secret string in your shell history. Do not do this outside of testing. The command above creates this output: Reading plaintext input from stdin. (ctrl-d to end input, twice if your content does not already have a new line) ANSIBLE_VAULT .2 AES256 dev To be prompted for a string to encrypt, encrypt it with the ‘dev’ vault password from ‘a_password_file’, name the variable ‘new_user_password’ and give it the vault ID label ‘dev’: The command above triggers this prompt: Reading plaintext input from stdin. (ctrl-d to end input, twice if your content does not already have a new line) Type the string to encrypt (for example, ‘hunter2’), hit ctrl-d, and wait. Do not press after supplying the string to encrypt. That will add a newline to the encrypted value. The sequence above creates this output: You can add the output from any of the examples above to any playbook, variables file, or role for future use. Encrypted variables are larger than plain-text variables, but they protect your sensitive content while leaving the rest of the playbook, variables file, or role in plain text so you can easily read it. You can view the original value of an encrypted variable using the debug module. You must pass the password that was used to encrypt the variable. For example, if you stored the variable created by the last example above in a file called ‘vars.yml’, you could view the unencrypted value of that variable like this:\n\nAnsible Vault can encrypt any structured data file used by Ansible, including:\n• None variables files passed to ansible-playbook with or The full file is encrypted in the vault. Ansible Vault uses an editor to create or modify encrypted files. See Steps to secure your editor for some guidance on securing the editor. File-level encryption is easy to use. Password rotation for encrypted files is straightforward with the rekey command. Encrypting files can hide not only sensitive values but the names of the variables you use. However, with file-level encryption, the contents of files are no longer easy to access and read. This may be a problem with encrypted tasks files. When encrypting a variables file, see Keep vaulted variables safely visible for one way to keep references to these variables in a non-encrypted file. Ansible always decrypts the entire encrypted file when it is loaded or referenced because Ansible cannot know if it needs the content unless it decrypts it. To create a new encrypted data file called ‘foo.yml’ with the ‘test’ vault password from ‘multi_password_file’: The tool launches an editor (whatever editor you have defined with $EDITOR, the default editor is vi). Add the content. When you close the editor session, the file is saved as encrypted data. The file header reflects the vault ID used to create it: To create a new encrypted data file with the vault ID ‘my_new_password’ assigned to it and be prompted for the password: Again, add content to the file in the editor and save. Be sure to store the new password you created at the prompt, so you can find it when you want to decrypt that file. To encrypt an existing file, use the ansible-vault encrypt command. This command can operate on multiple files at once. For example: To encrypt existing files with the ‘project’ ID and be prompted for the password: To view the contents of an encrypted file without editing it, you can use the ansible-vault view command: To edit an encrypted file in place, use the ansible-vault edit command. This command decrypts the file to a temporary file, allows you to edit the content, then saves and re-encrypts the content and removes the temporary file when you close the editor. For example: To edit a file encrypted with the password file and assigned the vault ID : To change the password on an encrypted file or files, use the rekey command: This command can rekey multiple data files at once and will ask for the original password and also the new password. To set a different ID for the rekeyed files, pass the new ID to . For example, to rekey a list of files encrypted with the ‘preprod1’ vault ID from the ‘ppold’ file to the ‘preprod2’ vault ID and be prompted for the new password: If you have an encrypted file that you no longer want to keep encrypted, you can permanently decrypt it by running the ansible-vault decrypt command. This command will save the file unencrypted to the disk, so be sure you do not want to edit it instead. If you just want to check the content of an encrypted string you can also view it by passing it via stdin: Alternatively you can use the following command to have Ansible prompt you for input (use Ctrl+D twice to end the input), just like when using : Ansible Vault relies on your configured editor, which can be a source of disclosures. Most editors have ways to prevent loss of data, but these normally rely on extra plain text files that can have a clear text copy of your secrets. Consult your editor documentation to configure the editor to avoid disclosing secure data. The following sections provide some guidance on common editors but should not be taken as a complete guide to securing your editor. You can set the following options in command mode to avoid cases of disclosure. There may be more settings you need to modify to ensure security, especially when using plugins, so consult the documentation.\n• None Disable swapfiles that act like an autosave in case of crash or interruption.\n• None Disable the viminfo file from copying data from your current session. You can optionally add these settings in for all files, or just specific paths or extensions. See the manual for details. You can set the following Emacs options to avoid cases of disclosure. There may be more settings you need to modify to ensure security, especially when using plugins, so consult the Emacs documentation.\n• None Do not copy data to the system clipboard."

Different encryptable files include group, host, defaults, roles, and other custom variable files, tasks files, handlers files, binary, or other arbitrary files.\n\nTo create a new encrypted file with Ansible Vault, use:\n\n\n\nEnter a password when prompted, add your content in the editor, save, and exit. The file will be encrypted automatically.\n\nFor example, let's create a new encrypted file, , with vault ID dev, and get prompted for the password, use this command:\n\n \n\n\n\nThis will open your configured editor (by default, vi) to provide the content to be encrypted. The considerations for storing and using Ansible Vault passwords discussed earlier also apply here.\n\nAfter you provide your plain text content to the file and save and exit from it, you will only see the encrypted version when you try to view the content. You will need to decrypt it to view it in plain text again.\n\nTo encrypt an existing file with Ansible Vault, use:\n\n\n\nThis will prompt you to set a password for encryption. Once completed, the file will be encrypted and its contents secured.\n\nBefore encrypting this example existing file, let's take a look at its content:\n\n\n\nNext, let's encrypt it. This operation is as simple as running this command:\n\n\n\nYou will be prompted for a password, which is required for the decrypt operation.\n\nNow if we want to check the content of the file, this is what we will see:\n\n\n\nUsing Ansible Vault to work with encrypted content\n\nIn the previous section, we explained the process and reviewed several options for encrypting different content with Ansible Vault. Now, let's look at how we can utilize and work with encrypted content.\n\nOne of the most common user operations is to view the encrypted content if necessary. You can leverage the debug module to view the plaintext value of encrypted content.\n\nLet's create a simple encrypted variable and pass the password via the prompt:\n\nNext, we store this variable in a file named .\n\nTo view the encrypted value, use the module and pass the location of the password as we have seen earlier:\n\n\n\nViewing the contents of encrypted files without decrypting them permanently is quite simple with the command:\n\n\n\nAnother handy option when working with encrypted files is the ability to edit the encrypted content with the command:\n\n\n\nThis command prompts the user for the password, decrypts the content to a temporary file, allows the user to edit the encrypted content with the configured editor, and finally saves and re-encrypts the file.\n\nTo permanently decrypt an encrypted file, use the command. You will need to provide the encryption password:\n\n\n\nNow if we go back and check the content of that file, it will be human-readable again:\n\n\n\nNote: After running the command, the file will be permanently decrypted. If you want to temporarily view or use the contents, consider using instead. Make sure you handle decrypted files securely to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information.\n\nAnother common operation is to rotate or change the password used for encryption. As discussed briefly in the previous section, this can be achieved with the command.\n\nTo change the password for an encrypted file, use the command below, and pass the current and the new password when prompted:\n\n\n\nYou will need to provide the old password and then provide a new password and confirm it for this to work.\n\nWhen you need to decrypt content from a playbook with encrypted variables that have been created with different passwords and vault IDs, pass multiple flags when executing the playbook.\n\nIf you use a specific vault ID or a password source more frequently than others, you can define default options and avoid passing them every time. Leverage DEFAULT_VAULT_DENY_LIST and DEFAULT_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE to set this up.\n\nAnsible Vault supports using an environment variable to specify the password for encrypting and decrypting Vault files. This helps avoid passing the password directly as a command-line argument or typing it manually, making it useful for automation in CI/CD pipelines.\n\nThe environment variable used by Ansible Vault is .\n\nLet's see an example.\n\nFirst, create a file containing your Vault password.\n\n\n\nSet the environment variable to point to your password file:\n\n\n\nWith the environment variable set, Ansible Vault automatically uses the password from the specified file, so you don't need to provide it interactively or via the option.\n\nHere are best practices to consider when you are using Ansible Vault:\n• Use strong passwords for encryptions: You should avoid easily guessed passwords, and ensure your passwords are strong and complex.\n• Avoid storing Vault passwords in VCS: Never commit Vault passwords to a git repository because this will result in instant password breaches\n• Rotate secrets regularly: Regularly rotate secrets stored in Ansible Vault to reduce the risk of unauthorized access in case of a breach.\n• Audit and review access: Ensure only authorized people have access to Vault files and passwords.\n• Integrate with secret management Tools: If you require advanced features and integrations, Integrate with external secret management tools such as HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.\n\nHow Spacelift can help you with Ansible projects\n\nSpacelift's vibrant ecosystem and excellent GitOps flow can greatly assist you in managing and orchestrating Ansible. By introducing Spacelift on top of Ansible, you can then easily create custom workflows based on pull requests and apply any necessary compliance checks for your organization.\n\nAnother great advantage of using Spacelift is that you can manage different infrastructure tools like Ansible, Terraform, Pulumi, AWS CloudFormation, and even Kubernetes from the same place and combine their Stacks with building workflows across tools.\n\nOur latest Ansible enhancements solve three of the biggest challenges engineers face when they are using Ansible:\n• Having a centralized place in which you can run your playbooks\n• Getting insights into what ran and where\n\nProvisioning, configuring, governing, and even orchestrating your containers can be performed with a single workflow, separating the elements into smaller chunks to identify issues more easily.\n\nIf you want to learn more about using Spacelift with Ansible, check our documentation, read our Ansible guide, or book a demo with one of our engineers.\n\nIn this blog post, we explored different options for encrypting sensitive information by leveraging Ansible Vault. We explained Ansible Vault’s main functionality and discussed various options for handling sensitive content, passwords, and files. Lastly, we reviewed examples and use cases of using encrypted content."

        "document": "The “Vault” is a feature of Ansible that allows you to keep sensitive data such as passwords or keys protected at rest, rather than as plaintext in playbooks or roles. These vaults can then be distributed or placed in source control.\n\nThere are 2 types of vaulted content and each has their own uses and limitations:\n\nTo enable this feature, a command line tool, ansible-vault is used to edit files, and a command line flag , or is used. You can also modify your file to specify the location of a password file or configure Ansible to always prompt for the password. These options require no command line flag usage.\n\nFor best practices advice, refer to Variables and Vaults.\n\nTo run a playbook that contains vault-encrypted data files, you must provide the vault password. To specify the vault-password interactively: This prompt will then be used to decrypt (in memory only) any vault encrypted files that are accessed. Alternatively, passwords can be specified with a file or a script (the script version will require Ansible 1.7 or later). When using this flag, ensure permissions on the file are such that no one else can access your key and do not add your key to source control: The password should be a string stored as a single line in the file. If you are using a script instead of a flat file, ensure that it is marked as executable, and that the password is printed to standard output. If your script needs to prompt for data, prompts can be sent to standard error. You can also set environment variable, e.g. and Ansible will automatically search for the password in that file. This is something you may wish to do if using Ansible from a continuous integration system like Jenkins. The option can also be used with the ansible-pull command if you wish, though this would require distributing the keys to your nodes, so understand the implications – vault is more intended for push mode.\n\nAnsible 2.4 and later support the concept of multiple vaults that are encrypted with different passwords Different vaults can be given a label to distinguish them (generally values like dev, prod etc.). The and options can be used as long as only a single password is needed for any given run. Alternatively the option can be used to provide the password and indicate which vault label it’s for. This can be clearer when multiple vaults are used within a single inventory. For example: To be prompted for the ‘dev’ password: To get the ‘dev’ password from a file or script: If multiple vault passwords are required for a single run, must be used as it can be specified multiple times to provide the multiple passwords. For example: To read the ‘dev’ password from a file and prompt for the ‘prod’ password: The or options can be used to specify one of the passwords, but it’s generally cleaner to avoid mixing these with . By default the vault label (dev, prod etc.) is just a hint. Ansible will try to decrypt each vault with every provided password. Setting the config option DEFAULT_VAULT_ID_MATCH will change this behavior so that each password is only used to decrypt data that was encrypted with the same label. See Labelling Vaults for more details.\n\nThis command will output a string in the above format ready to be included in a YAML file. The string to encrypt can be provided via stdin, command line arguments, or via an interactive prompt. See Use encrypt_string to create encrypted variables to embed in yaml."

        "document": "Managing your encrypted content is easier if you develop a strategy for managing your vault passwords. A vault password can be any string you choose. There is no special command to create a vault password. However, you need to keep track of your vault passwords. Each time you encrypt a variable or file with Ansible Vault, you must provide a password. When you use an encrypted variable or file in a command or playbook, you must provide the same password that was used to encrypt it. To develop a strategy for managing vault passwords, start with two questions:\n\nIf you have a small team or few sensitive values, you can use a single password for everything you encrypt with Ansible Vault. Store your vault password securely in a file or a secret manager as described below. If you have a larger team or many sensitive values, you can use multiple passwords. For example, you can use different passwords for different users or different levels of access. Depending on your needs, you might want a different password for each encrypted file, for each directory, or each environment. You might have a playbook that includes two vars files, one for the dev environment and one for the production environment, encrypted with two different passwords. When you run the playbook, you can select the correct vault password for the environment you are targeting using a vault ID.\n\nIf you use multiple vault passwords, you can differentiate one password from another with vault IDs. You use the vault ID in three ways:\n• None Pass it with to the ansible-vault command when you create encrypted content\n• None Include it wherever you store the password for that vault ID (see Storing and accessing vault passwords)\n• None Pass it with to the ansible-playbook command when you run a playbook that uses content you encrypted with that vault ID When you pass a vault ID as an option to the ansible-vault command, you add a label (a hint or nickname) to the encrypted content. This label documents which password you used to encrypt it. The encrypted variable or file includes the vault ID label in plain text in the header. The vault ID is the last element before the encrypted content. For example: In addition to the label, you must provide a source for the related password. The source can be a prompt, a file, or a script, depending on how you are storing your vault passwords. The pattern looks like this: If your playbook uses multiple encrypted variables or files that you encrypted with different passwords, you must pass the vault IDs when you run that playbook. You can use by itself, with , or with . The pattern is the same as when you create encrypted content: include the label and the source for the matching password. See below for examples of encrypting content with vault IDs and using content encrypted with vault IDs. The option works with any Ansible command that interacts with vaults, including ansible-vault, ansible-playbook, and so on. Ansible does not enforce using the same password every time you use a particular vault ID label. You can encrypt different variables or files with the same vault ID label but different passwords. This usually happens when you type the password at a prompt and make a mistake. It is possible to use different passwords with the same vault ID label on purpose. For example, you could use each label as a reference to a class of passwords, rather than a single password. In this scenario, you must always know which specific password or file to use in context. However, you are more likely to encrypt two files with the same vault ID label and different passwords by mistake. If you encrypt two files with the same label but different passwords by accident, you can rekey one file to fix the issue. By default, the vault ID label is only a hint to remind you which password you used to encrypt a variable or file. Ansible does not check that the vault ID in the header of the encrypted content matches the vault ID you provide when you use the content. Ansible decrypts all files and variables called by your command or playbook that are encrypted with the password you provide. To check the encrypted content and decrypt it only when the vault ID it contains matches the one you provide with , set the config option DEFAULT_VAULT_ID_MATCH. When you set DEFAULT_VAULT_ID_MATCH, each password is only used to decrypt data that was encrypted with the same label. This is efficient and predictable and can reduce errors when different values are encrypted with different passwords. Even with the DEFAULT_VAULT_ID_MATCH setting enabled, Ansible does not enforce using the same password every time you use a particular vault ID label.\n\nYou can memorize your vault password or manually copy vault passwords from any source and paste them at a command-line prompt, but most users store them securely and access them as needed from within Ansible. You have two options for storing vault passwords that work from within Ansible: in files or a third-party tool, such as the system keyring or a secret manager. If you store your passwords in a third-party tool, you need a vault password client script to retrieve them from within Ansible. To store a vault password in a file, enter the password as a string on a single line in the file. Make sure the permissions on the file are appropriate. Do not add password files to source control. When you run a playbook that uses a vault password stored in a file, specify the file within the flag. For example:"
