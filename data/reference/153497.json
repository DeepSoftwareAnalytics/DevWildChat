        "document": "This module provides access to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard.\n\nThese functions cannot be used with complex numbers; use the functions of the same name from the module if you require support for complex numbers. The distinction between functions which support complex numbers and those which don’t is made since most users do not want to learn quite as much mathematics as required to understand complex numbers. Receiving an exception instead of a complex result allows earlier detection of the unexpected complex number used as a parameter, so that the programmer can determine how and why it was generated in the first place.\n\nThe following functions are provided by this module. Except when explicitly noted otherwise, all return values are floats.\n\nReturn the number of ways to choose k items from n items without repetition and without order. Evaluates to when and evaluates to zero when . Also called the binomial coefficient because it is equivalent to the coefficient of k-th term in polynomial expansion of . Raises if either of the arguments are not integers. Raises if either of the arguments are negative. Return n factorial as an integer. Raises if n is not integral or is negative. Changed in version 3.10: Floats with integral values (like ) are no longer accepted. Return the greatest common divisor of the specified integer arguments. If any of the arguments is nonzero, then the returned value is the largest positive integer that is a divisor of all arguments. If all arguments are zero, then the returned value is . without arguments returns . Changed in version 3.9: Added support for an arbitrary number of arguments. Formerly, only two arguments were supported. Return the integer square root of the nonnegative integer n. This is the floor of the exact square root of n, or equivalently the greatest integer a such that a² ≤ n. For some applications, it may be more convenient to have the least integer a such that n ≤ a², or in other words the ceiling of the exact square root of n. For positive n, this can be computed using . Return the least common multiple of the specified integer arguments. If all arguments are nonzero, then the returned value is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of all arguments. If any of the arguments is zero, then the returned value is . without arguments returns . Return the number of ways to choose k items from n items without repetition and with order. Evaluates to when and evaluates to zero when . If k is not specified or is , then k defaults to n and the function returns . Raises if either of the arguments are not integers. Raises if either of the arguments are negative.\n\nReturn the ceiling of x, the smallest integer greater than or equal to x. If x is not a float, delegates to , which should return an value. Return the absolute value of x. Return the floor of x, the largest integer less than or equal to x. If x is not a float, delegates to , which should return an value. Fused multiply-add operation. Return , computed as though with infinite precision and range followed by a single round to the format. This operation often provides better accuracy than the direct expression . This function follows the specification of the fusedMultiplyAdd operation described in the IEEE 754 standard. The standard leaves one case implementation-defined, namely the result of and . In these cases, returns a NaN, and does not raise any exception. Return the floating-point remainder of , as defined by the platform C library function . Note that the Python expression may not return the same result. The intent of the C standard is that be exactly (mathematically; to infinite precision) equal to for some integer n such that the result has the same sign as x and magnitude less than . Python’s returns a result with the sign of y instead, and may not be exactly computable for float arguments. For example, is , but the result of Python’s is , which cannot be represented exactly as a float, and rounds to the surprising . For this reason, function is generally preferred when working with floats, while Python’s is preferred when working with integers. Return the fractional and integer parts of x. Both results carry the sign of x and are floats. Note that has a different call/return pattern than its C equivalents: it takes a single argument and return a pair of values, rather than returning its second return value through an ‘output parameter’ (there is no such thing in Python). Return the IEEE 754-style remainder of x with respect to y. For finite x and finite nonzero y, this is the difference , where is the closest integer to the exact value of the quotient . If is exactly halfway between two consecutive integers, the nearest even integer is used for . The remainder thus always satisfies . Special cases follow IEEE 754: in particular, is x for any finite x, and and raise for any non-NaN x. If the result of the remainder operation is zero, that zero will have the same sign as x. On platforms using IEEE 754 binary floating point, the result of this operation is always exactly representable: no rounding error is introduced. Return x with the fractional part removed, leaving the integer part. This rounds toward 0: is equivalent to for positive x, and equivalent to for negative x. If x is not a float, delegates to , which should return an value. For the , , and functions, note that all floating-point numbers of sufficiently large magnitude are exact integers. Python floats typically carry no more than 53 bits of precision (the same as the platform C double type), in which case any float x with necessarily has no fractional bits.\n\nReturn a float with the magnitude (absolute value) of x but the sign of y. On platforms that support signed zeros, returns -1.0. Return the mantissa and exponent of x as the pair . m is a float and e is an integer such that exactly. If x is zero, returns , otherwise . This is used to “pick apart” the internal representation of a float in a portable way. Note that has a different call/return pattern than its C equivalents: it takes a single argument and return a pair of values, rather than returning its second return value through an ‘output parameter’ (there is no such thing in Python). Return if the values a and b are close to each other and otherwise. Whether or not two values are considered close is determined according to given absolute and relative tolerances. If no errors occur, the result will be: . rel_tol is the relative tolerance – it is the maximum allowed difference between a and b, relative to the larger absolute value of a or b. For example, to set a tolerance of 5%, pass . The default tolerance is , which assures that the two values are the same within about 9 decimal digits. rel_tol must be nonnegative and less than . abs_tol is the absolute tolerance; it defaults to and it must be nonnegative. When comparing to , is computed as , which is for any nonzero and rel_tol less than . So add an appropriate positive abs_tol argument to the call. The IEEE 754 special values of , , and will be handled according to IEEE rules. Specifically, is not considered close to any other value, including . and are only considered close to themselves. Return if x is neither an infinity nor a NaN, and otherwise. (Note that is considered finite.) Return if x is a positive or negative infinity, and otherwise. Return if x is a NaN (not a number), and otherwise. Return . This is essentially the inverse of function . Return the floating-point value steps steps after x towards y. If x is equal to y, return y, unless steps is zero.\n• None goes up: towards positive infinity.\n• None goes down: towards minus infinity.\n• None goes towards zero.\n• None goes away from zero. Return the value of the least significant bit of the float x:\n• None If x is a NaN (not a number), return x.\n• None If x is equal to zero, return the smallest positive denormalized representable float (smaller than the minimum positive normalized float, ).\n• None If x is equal to the largest positive representable float, return the value of the least significant bit of x, such that the first float smaller than x is .\n• None Otherwise (x is a positive finite number), return the value of the least significant bit of x, such that the first float bigger than x is . ULP stands for “Unit in the Last Place”. See also and .\n\nReturn e raised to the power x, where e = 2.718281… is the base of natural logarithms. This is usually more accurate than or . Return e raised to the power x, minus 1. Here e is the base of natural logarithms. For small floats x, the subtraction in can result in a significant loss of precision; the function provides a way to compute this quantity to full precision: With one argument, return the natural logarithm of x (to base e). With two arguments, return the logarithm of x to the given base, calculated as . Return the natural logarithm of 1+x (base e). The result is calculated in a way which is accurate for x near zero. Return the base-2 logarithm of x. This is usually more accurate than . returns the number of bits necessary to represent an integer in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros. Return the base-10 logarithm of x. This is usually more accurate than . Return x raised to the power y. Exceptional cases follow the IEEE 754 standard as far as possible. In particular, and always return , even when x is a zero or a NaN. If both x and y are finite, x is negative, and y is not an integer then is undefined, and raises . Unlike the built-in operator, converts both its arguments to type . Use or the built-in function for computing exact integer powers. Changed in version 3.11: The special cases and were changed to return instead of raising , for consistency with IEEE 754.\n\nReturn the Euclidean distance between two points p and q, each given as a sequence (or iterable) of coordinates. The two points must have the same dimension. Return an accurate floating-point sum of values in the iterable. Avoids loss of precision by tracking multiple intermediate partial sums. The algorithm’s accuracy depends on IEEE-754 arithmetic guarantees and the typical case where the rounding mode is half-even. On some non-Windows builds, the underlying C library uses extended precision addition and may occasionally double-round an intermediate sum causing it to be off in its least significant bit. For further discussion and two alternative approaches, see the ASPN cookbook recipes for accurate floating-point summation. Return the Euclidean norm, . This is the length of the vector from the origin to the point given by the coordinates. For a two dimensional point , this is equivalent to computing the hypotenuse of a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem, . Changed in version 3.8: Added support for n-dimensional points. Formerly, only the two dimensional case was supported. Changed in version 3.10: Improved the algorithm’s accuracy so that the maximum error is under 1 ulp (unit in the last place). More typically, the result is almost always correctly rounded to within 1/2 ulp. Calculate the product of all the elements in the input iterable. The default start value for the product is . When the iterable is empty, return the start value. This function is intended specifically for use with numeric values and may reject non-numeric types. Return the sum of products of values from two iterables p and q. Raises if the inputs do not have the same length. For float and mixed int/float inputs, the intermediate products and sums are computed with extended precision.\n\nThe mathematical constant π = 3.141592…, to available precision. The mathematical constant e = 2.718281…, to available precision. The mathematical constant τ = 6.283185…, to available precision. Tau is a circle constant equal to 2π, the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its radius. To learn more about Tau, check out Vi Hart’s video Pi is (still) Wrong, and start celebrating Tau day by eating twice as much pie! A floating-point positive infinity. (For negative infinity, use .) Equivalent to the output of . A floating-point “not a number” (NaN) value. Equivalent to the output of . Due to the requirements of the IEEE-754 standard, and are not considered to equal to any other numeric value, including themselves. To check whether a number is a NaN, use the function to test for NaNs instead of or . Example: Changed in version 3.11: It is now always available. CPython implementation detail: The module consists mostly of thin wrappers around the platform C math library functions. Behavior in exceptional cases follows Annex F of the C99 standard where appropriate. The current implementation will raise for invalid operations like or (where C99 Annex F recommends signaling invalid operation or divide-by-zero), and for results that overflow (for example, ). A NaN will not be returned from any of the functions above unless one or more of the input arguments was a NaN; in that case, most functions will return a NaN, but (again following C99 Annex F) there are some exceptions to this rule, for example or . Note that Python makes no effort to distinguish signaling NaNs from quiet NaNs, and behavior for signaling NaNs remains unspecified. Typical behavior is to treat all NaNs as though they were quiet.

If you're using Python 3.6+, you can use (*literal string interpolation) for printing:\n\nIf you're on an older version of Python, then use string formatting:\n\nIn both cases, means to use a string of fixed width at 4 aligned right, where means right-align, and is the fixed width. These both result in:\n\nBut to do it in a single step, not storing the matrix , you can simply do:\n\nNote that here joins strings together. So in the inner loop, it's joining together all the numbers with their fixed-width right-aligned representation for each column inside a row, and then it's joining together those rows with a new line separator for each row."

        "document": "Multiplying matrices is a fundamental operation in various applications such as mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science, particularly in the fields of linear algebra, graphics transformations, and machine learning algorithms. This process involves taking two matrices and producing a third matrix that represents their product, following specific arithmetic rules.\n\nIn this article, you learn how to multiply two matrices using Python. This includes setting up the matrices, performing the multiplication, and handling matrices of different sizes. You'll see clear examples to demonstrate each step of the matrix multiplication process using typical programming structures in Python.\n\nSetting Up Your Matrices in Python\n\nBefore multiplying two matrices, ensure they conform to the rule of matrix multiplication, which states that the number of columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix. Here is how to set up matrices in Python:\n• None Define two matrices as lists of lists. Matrix A is a 2x3 matrix (2 rows and 3 columns), and matrix B is a 3x2 matrix (3 rows and 2 columns).\n• None Verify the dimensions to ensure multiplication is possible. This step checks if the number of columns in A is equal to the number of rows in B, which is necessary for multiplication to proceed.\n\nOnce matrices are defined and validated, proceed with the multiplication. The product matrix will have a number of rows equal to the number of rows in the first matrix and a number of columns equal to the number of columns in the second matrix.\n• This sets up a result matrix of the correct size, initially filled with zeros.\n• None Use nested loops to multiply matrices and store the result. In these loops, indexes rows of the first matrix, indexes columns of the second matrix, and iterates over the elements in the row of A and the column of B to compute each component of the product matrix.\n• This will output the result of the matrix multiplication.\n\nMatrix multiplication is strict about the dimensions of the involved matrices. Here is how to deal with matrices when they do not meet the standard dimensions requirements:\n• Ensure proper size condition checks as shown in the setup examples.\n• Appropriately manage errors or conditions of incompatible matrices by providing clear messages or handling exceptions in a way that aids debugging or further computation attempts.\n\nMultiplying two matrices in Python requires a good understanding of list handling and loop structuring. By following the examples provided, you enhance your ability to perform complex matrix operations that are crucial in many technical and scientific computing scenarios. Employ these techniques in your projects to efficiently handle mathematical computations involving matrices. With these skills, you ensure robustness and accuracy in your computational tasks involving matrix algebra."
