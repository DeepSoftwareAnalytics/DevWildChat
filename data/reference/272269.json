Web storage is more secure, and large amounts of data can be stored locally, without affecting website performance.\n\nUnlike cookies, the storage limit is far larger (at least 5MB) and information is never transferred to the server.\n\nWeb storage is per origin (per domain and protocol). All pages, from one origin, can store and access the same data.\n\nWeb storage provides two objects for storing data in the browser:\n• - stores data with no expiration date (data is not lost when the browser tab is closed)\n• - stores data for one session (data is lost when the browser tab is closed)\n\nThe numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully supports Web Storage.\n\nBefore using web storage, we can quickly check browser support for localStorage and sessionStorage:\n\nThe object stores the data with no expiration date. The data will not be lost when the browser is closed, and will be available the next day, week, or year.\n• Use the method to create name/value pairs\n• Use the method to retrieve the values set\n• Retrieve the value of \"lastname\" and insert it into an element with id=\"result\"\n• Retrieve the value of \"bgcolor\" and insert it into the style backgroundColor of the element with id=\"result\"\n\nThe syntax for removing the \"lastname\" localStorage item is as follows:\n\nNote: Name/value pairs are always stored as strings. Remember to convert them to another format when needed!\n\nThe following example counts the number of times a user has clicked a button. In this code the value string is converted to a number to be able to increase the counter:\n\nThe object is equal to the object, except that it stores the data for only one session! The data is deleted when the user closes the specific browser tab.\n\nThe following example counts the number of times a user has clicked a button, in the current session:\n\n<script>\n\nfunction clickCounter() {\n\n const x = document.getElementById(\"result\");\n\n if (typeof(Storage) !== \"undefined\") {\n\n if (sessionStorage.clickcount) {\n\n sessionStorage.clickcount = Number(sessionStorage.clickcount)+1;\n\n } else {\n\n sessionStorage.clickcount = 1;\n\n }\n\n x.innerHTML = \"You have clicked the button \" + sessionStorage.clickcount + \" time(s) in this session!\";\n\n } else {\n\n x.innerHTML = \"Sorry, no Web storage support!\";\n\n }\n\n}\n\n</script> Try it Yourself »"

        "document": "Storage objects are simple key-value stores, similar to objects, but they stay intact through page loads. The keys and the values are always strings (note that, as with objects, integer keys will be automatically converted to strings). You can access these values like an object, or with the and methods. These three lines all set the (same) colorSetting entry: Note: It's recommended to use the Web Storage API ( , , , , ) to prevent the pitfalls associated with using plain objects as key-value stores. The two mechanisms within Web Storage are as follows:\n• maintains a separate storage area for each given origin that's available for the duration of the page session (as long as the browser is open, including page reloads and restores).\n• does the same thing, but persists even when the browser is closed and reopened. These mechanisms are available via the and properties (to be more precise, in supporting browsers the object implements the and objects, which the and properties are members of) — invoking one of these will create an instance of the object, through which data items can be set, retrieved, and removed. A different Storage object is used for the and for each origin — they function and are controlled separately. So, for example, initially calling on a document will return a object; calling on a document will return a different object. Both of these can be manipulated in the same way, but separately.\n\nBrowsers that support localStorage have a property on the window object named . However, just testing that the property exists, like in normal feature detection, may be insufficient. Various browsers offer settings that disable the storage API, without hiding the global object. So a browser may support , but not make it available to the scripts on the page. For example, for a document viewed in a browser's private browsing mode, some browsers might give us an empty object with a quota of zero, effectively making it unusable. Conversely, we might get a legitimate , which means that we've used up all available storage space, but storage is actually available. Our feature detection should take these scenarios into account. Here is a function that detects whether localStorage is both supported and available: function storageAvailable(type) { let storage; try { storage = window[type]; const x = \"__storage_test__\"; storage.setItem(x, x); storage.removeItem(x); return true; } catch (e) { return ( e instanceof DOMException && e.name === \"QuotaExceededError\" && // acknowledge QuotaExceededError only if there's something already stored storage && storage.length !== 0 ); } } And here is how you would use it: if (storageAvailable(\"localStorage\")) { // Yippee! We can use localStorage awesomeness } else { // Too bad, no localStorage for us } You can test for instead by calling .\n\nTo illustrate some typical web storage usage, we have created an example, imaginatively called Web Storage Demo. The landing page provides controls that can be used to customize the color, font, and decorative image: When you choose different options, the page is instantly updated; in addition, your choices are stored in , so that when you leave the page and load it again, later on, your choices are remembered. We have also provided an event output page — if you load this page in another tab, then make changes to your choices in the landing page, you'll see the updated storage information outputted as a is fired. Note: As well as viewing the example pages live using the above links, you can also check out the source code.\n\nTesting whether your storage has been populated To start with, in main.js, we test whether the storage object has already been populated (i.e., the page was previously accessed): The method is used to get a data item from storage; in this case, we are testing to see whether the item exists; if not, we run to add the existing customization values to the storage. If there are already values there, we run to update the page styling with the stored values. Note: You could also use to test whether the storage object is empty or not.\n\nAs noted above, values can be retrieved from storage using . This takes the key of the data item as an argument, and returns the data value. Here, the first three lines grab the values from local storage. Next, we set the values displayed in the form elements to those values, so that they keep in sync when you reload the page. Finally, we update the styles/decorative image on the page, so your customization options come up again on reload.\n\nis used both to create new data items, and (if the data item already exists) update existing values. This takes two arguments — the key of the data item to create/modify, and the value to store in it. The function sets three items in local storage — the background color, font, and image path. It then runs the function to update the page styles, etc. We've also included an handler on each form element so that the data and styling are updated whenever a form value is changed: only supports storing and retrieving strings. If you want to save other data types, you have to convert them to strings. For plain objects and arrays, you can use . const person = { name: \"Alex\" }; localStorage.setItem(\"user\", person); console.log(localStorage.getItem(\"user\")); // \"[object Object]\"; not useful! localStorage.setItem(\"user\", JSON.stringify(person)); console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(\"user\"))); // { name: \"Alex\" } However, there's no generic way to store arbitrary data types. Furthermore, the retrieved object is a deep copy of the original object and mutations to it do not affect the original object.\n\nResponding to storage changes with the StorageEvent The event is fired whenever a change is made to the object of another document that shares the same storage space. This won't work on the same page that is making the changes — it is really a way for other pages on the origin using the storage to sync any changes that are made. Pages on other origins can't access the same storage objects. For , the storage space is shared between all tabs with the same origin. For , the storage space is only shared within the tab, among all iframes from the same origin. On the events page (see events.js) the only JavaScript is as follows: Here we add an event listener to the object that fires when the object associated with the current origin is changed. As you can see above, the event object associated with this event has a number of properties containing useful information — the key of the data that changed, the old value before the change, the new value after that change, the URL of the document that changed the storage, and the storage object itself (which we've stringified so you can see its content)."

The two types of storage are local and session storage. Local storage saves the data in the user's browser with no expiration date. Session storage saves the data until the current session is ended Data is stored using pairs. Data can only be saved as strings. Examples of where you might use it are to to remember a username, a term last searched, remember previous checkbox configurations, load HTML content onto page so it is faster to load if reloaded, There are several methods you can use for local storage: setItem, getItem, key, length, removeItem, and clear. Both session and local storage use the same methods.\n\nStoring and Retrieving Different Types of Data Single inputs can be added to or changed and saved into localStorage using or . These types of arrays are written like an object but referenced similar to an array, but with the key name instead of index number.

        "document": "When it comes to client-side storage in web applications, the localStorage API stands out as a simple and widely supported solution. It allows developers to store key-value pairs directly in a user's browser. In this article, we will explore the various aspects of the localStorage API, its advantages, limitations, and alternative storage options available for modern applications.\n\nThe localStorage API is a built-in feature of web browsers that enables web developers to store small amounts of data persistently on a user's device. It operates on a simple key-value basis, allowing developers to save strings, numbers, and other simple data types. This data remains available even after the user closes the browser or navigates away from the page. The API provides a convenient way to maintain state and store user preferences without relying on server-side storage.\n\nLet's dive into some hands-on code examples to better understand how to leverage the power of localStorage. The API offers several methods for interaction, including setItem, getItem, removeItem, and clear. Consider the following code snippet:\n\nWhile js localStorage excels at handling simple key-value pairs, it also supports more intricate data storage through JSON serialization. By utilizing JSON.stringify and JSON.parse, you can store and retrieve structured data like objects and arrays. Here's an example of storing a document:\n\nDespite its convenience, localStorage does come with a set of limitations that developers should be aware of:\n• Non-Async Blocking API: One significant drawback is that js localStorage operates as a non-async blocking API. This means that any operations performed on localStorage can potentially block the main thread, leading to slower application performance and a less responsive user experience.\n• Limited Data Structure: Unlike more advanced databases, localStorage is limited to a simple key-value store. This restriction makes it unsuitable for storing complex data structures or managing relationships between data elements.\n• Stringification Overhead: Storing JSON data in localStorage requires stringifying the data before storage and parsing it when retrieved. This process introduces performance overhead, potentially slowing down operations by up to 10 times.\n• Lack of Indexing: localStorage lacks indexing capabilities, making it challenging to perform efficient searches or iterate over data based on specific criteria. This limitation can hinder applications that rely on complex data retrieval.\n• Tab Blocking: In a multi-tab environment, one tab's localStorage operations can impact the performance of other tabs by monopolizing CPU resources. You can reproduce this behavior by opening this test file in two browser windows and trigger localstorage inserts in one of them. You will observe that the indication spinner will stuck in both windows.\n• Storage Limit: Browsers typically impose a storage limit of around 5 MiB for each origin's localStorage.\n\nContrary to concerns about performance, the localStorage API in JavaScript is surprisingly fast when compared to alternative storage solutions like IndexedDB or OPFS. It excels in handling small key-value assignments efficiently. Due to its simplicity and direct integration with browsers, accessing and modifying localStorage data incur minimal overhead. For scenarios where quick and straightforward data storage is required, localStorage remains a viable option. For example RxDB uses localStorage in the localStorage meta optimizer to manage simple key values pairs while storing the \"normal\" documents inside of another storage like IndexedDB.\n\nWhile localStorage offers convenience, it may not be suitable for every use case. Consider the following situations where alternatives might be more appropriate:\n• Data Must Be Queryable: If your application relies heavily on querying data based on specific criteria, localStorage might not provide the necessary querying capabilities. Complex data retrieval might lead to inefficient code and slow performance.\n• Big JSON Documents: Storing large JSON documents in localStorage can consume a significant amount of memory and degrade performance. It's essential to assess the size of the data you intend to store and consider more robust solutions for handling substantial datasets.\n• Many Read/Write Operations: Excessive read and write operations on localStorage can lead to performance bottlenecks. Other storage solutions might offer better performance and scalability for applications that require frequent data manipulation.\n• Lack of Persistence: If your application can function without persistent data across sessions, consider using in-memory data structures like or . These options offer speed and efficiency for transient data.\n\nWhile localStorage serves as a reliable storage solution for simpler data needs, it's essential to explore alternatives like IndexedDB when dealing with more complex requirements. IndexedDB is designed to store not only key-value pairs but also JSON documents. Unlike localStorage, which usually has a storage limit of around 5-10MB per domain, IndexedDB can handle significantly larger datasets. IndexDB with its support for indexing facilitates efficient querying, making range queries possible. However, it's worth noting that IndexedDB lacks observability, which is a feature unique to localStorage through the event. Also, complex queries can pose a challenge with IndexedDB, and while its performance is acceptable, IndexedDB can be too slow for some use cases.\n\nFor those looking to harness the full power of IndexedDB with added capabilities, using wrapper libraries like RxDB is recommended. These libraries augment IndexedDB with features such as complex queries and observability, enhancing its usability for modern applications by providing a real database instead of only a key-value store.\n\nIn summary when you compare IndexedDB vs localStorage, IndexedDB will win at any case where much data is handled while localStorage has better performance on small key-value datasets.\n\nAnother intriguing option is the OPFS (File System API). This API provides direct access to an origin-based, sandboxed filesystem which is highly optimized for performance and offers in-place write access to its content. OPFS offers impressive performance benefits. However, working with the OPFS API can be complex, and it's only accessible within a WebWorker. To simplify its usage and extend its capabilities, consider using a wrapper library like RxDB's OPFS RxStorage, which builds a comprehensive database on top of the OPFS API. This abstraction allows you to harness the power of the OPFS API without the intricacies of direct usage.\n\nCookies, once a primary method of client-side data storage, have fallen out of favor in modern web development due to their limitations. While they can store data, they are about 100 times slower when compared to the localStorage API. Additionally, cookies are included in the HTTP header, which can impact network performance. As a result, cookies are not recommended for data storage purposes in contemporary web applications.\n\nWebSQL, despite offering a SQL-based interface for client-side data storage, is a deprecated technology and should be avoided. Its API has been phased out of modern browsers, and it lacks the robustness of alternatives like IndexedDB. Moreover, WebSQL tends to be around 10 times slower than IndexedDB, making it a suboptimal choice for applications that demand efficient data manipulation and retrieval.\n\nIn scenarios where data persistence beyond a session is unnecessary, developers often turn to sessionStorage. This storage mechanism retains data only for the duration of a tab or browser session. It survives page reloads and restores, providing a handy solution for temporary data needs. However, it's important to note that sessionStorage is limited in scope and may not suit all use cases.\n\nFor React Native developers, the AsyncStorage API is the go-to solution, mirroring the behavior of localStorage but with asynchronous support. Since not all JavaScript runtimes support localStorage, AsyncStorage offers a seamless alternative for data persistence in React Native applications.\n\nBecause native localStorage is absent in the Node.js JavaScript runtime, you will get the error in Node.js or node based runtimes like Next.js. The node-localstorage npm package bridges the gap. This package replicates the browser's localStorage API within the Node.js environment, ensuring consistent and compatible data storage capabilities.\n\nWhile browser extensions for chrome and firefox support the localStorage API, it is not recommended to use it in that context to store extension-related data. The browser will clear the data in many scenarios like when the users clear their browsing history.\n\nInstead the Extension Storage API should be used for browser extensions. In contrast to localStorage, the storage API works and all operations return a Promise. Also it provides automatic sync to replicate data between all instances of that browser that the user is logged into. The storage API is even able to storage JSON-ifiable objects instead of plain strings.\n\nThe Deno JavaScript runtime has a working localStorage API so running and the other methods, will just work and the locally stored data is persisted across multiple runs.\n\nBun does not support the localStorage JavaScript API. Trying to use will error with . To store data locally in Bun, you could use the module instead or directly use a in-JavaScript database with Bun support like RxDB.\n\nIn the world of modern web development, localStorage serves as a valuable tool for lightweight data storage. Its simplicity and speed make it an excellent choice for small key-value assignments. However, as application complexity grows, developers must assess their storage needs carefully. For scenarios that demand advanced querying, complex data structures, or high-volume operations, alternatives like IndexedDB, wrapper libraries with additional features like RxDB, or platform-specific APIs offer more robust solutions. By understanding the strengths and limitations of various storage options, developers can make informed decisions that pave the way for efficient and scalable applications.\n• Learn how to store and query data with RxDB in the RxDB Quickstart\n• Why IndexedDB is slow and how to fix it"

And using local storage is an effective way of persisting data in an application.\n\nIn this article, you will learn what local storage is and how to use it in modern web applications. You will also learn the advantages of using local storage, as well as some of its limitations.\n• How to Use Local Storage\n• How to View Local Storage in DevTools\n\nLocal storage is a feature in web browsers that allows developers to save data in the user’s browser. It’s part of the web storage API, together with session storage.\n\nLocal storage works by accepting data in key-value pairs. It retains the data even when the user refreshes the page or closes the tab or browser.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the web storage API in modern browsers provides two main features for data storage. These are local storage and session storage.\n\nThe key differences between the two are the lifespan of the stored data and their scope.\n\nData in local storage remains available even when the tab/browser is closed. But closing the tab/browser clears any data stored in session storage.\n\nAlso, data in local storage is accessible across multiple browser tabs and windows. On the other hand, data in session storage is only accessible within specific browser tabs and is not shared.\n\nHow to Use Local Storage\n\nThe local storage object provides different methods you can use to interact with it. With these methods, you can add, read, and delete data from local storage.\n\nHow to Store Data in Local Storage\n\nTo store data in local storage, you use the method. This method takes in two arguments, a key and a value.\n\nIf the key does not exist in local storage, the method will create a new key and assign the given value to it. But if a key with the same name exists in local storage, it will update the value of the key with the provided value.\n\nHow to Read Data From Local Storage\n\nTo retrieve and use data from local storage, you use the method. This method takes in a key as an argument.\n\nIf the given key exists in local storage, the method returns the value of that key. If it doesn’t, the method returns .\n\nHow to Store and Read Complex Data Values in Local Storage\n\nLocal storage can only store strings. This means if you need to store values like objects or arrays, you first need to get a string representation of the value. You do this using the method.\n\nThe method converts the object into a string representation before sending it to local storage.\n\nNow, when you want to retrieve the data back from local storage, you also need to change it from its string representation back to the original form. And you do that using the method.\n\nIn the example above, we first check if there is data for ‘user’ in local storage before using the method. This is important because if it does not exist in local storage, will be applied to a value (which will result in an error).\n\nHow to Delete Data from Local Storage\n\nThere are two methods available for deleting data from local storage. One is the method and the other is the method.\n\nYou use the method when you want to delete a single item from local storage. The method takes in a key as an argument and deletes the corresponding key-value pair from local storage.\n\nBut what if, instead of deleting a single key-value pair, you want to clear all data from the local storage? Well, local storage has a method for that - the method.\n\nThe method deletes all key-value pairs in the local storage for the current domain.\n\nHow to Get the Name of a Key in Local Storage\n\nIf you want to get the name of a key at a particular index in local storage, you can use the method. It takes in a number as an argument and returns the name of the key at that specified index.\n\nThe example above will return the name of the key at index 0. If there is no key at the specified index, the method will return null.\n\nThe following shows a practical demo of the difference between local storage and session storage.\n\nIn this example, we'll save the user's name in local storage and save the age in session storage.\n\nThe markup includes two header elements. One for and the other for . It also includes two input elements for name and age. Each input has an associated button we'll use for saving the data.\n\nNow, let's use the method to select the various elements.\n\nFirst, we get the value of the name input, set it as the of . And then use the of local storage to save the value in local storage.\n\nNext, let's see how we can get the name value from local storage when we need it.\n\nThe function gets using the method. If the value exists in local storage, we set it as the of the element. If it's or doesn't exist, then we set to the string \"No name data in local storage\".\n\nNow, let's do the same thing for the value. The only difference here will be using session storage instead of local storage.\n\nThe and methods also works for session storage.\n\nAs you can see from the demo above, when you close and reopen the page, the data from local storage persists. But the data from session storage is cleared once the page closes.\n\nTry your hands on the code sample on StackBlitz\n\nYou can follow the steps below to inspect the contents of local storage in your browser's developer tools.\n\nFirst, open DevTools. You can do that by right clicking on the web page and selecting \"Inspect\".\n\nDemo of how to open the DevTools.\n\nThen, select the \"Application\" tab on the DevTools panel. Depending on your browser, this panel may have a different name. For example, it's called \"Storage\" in Safari and Firefox.\n\nDemo of how to open the \"Application\" panel in DevTools.\n\nLocate the \"Storage\" section on the sidebar showing a list of the various web storage options.\n\nClick on \"Local Storage\" to expand and view its contents.\n\nDemo of how to open the local storage tab in the storage panel.\n\nYou can click on individual items to view the corresponding key-value pair.\n\nThe following are some of the benefits local storage has over other storage mechanisms in modern web development.\n• Persistent data: When you use local storage, the stored data remains even when the user closes the tab or the browser. This is useful for saving user preferences, settings, and other relevant data. It can help create a seamless user experience.\n• Offline access: You can use local storage as a means to cache data which can be accessed even with limited or no internet. This makes it a useful feature for apps that rely on caching data for offline use like news readers, productivity apps, and so on.\n• More storage capacity: Compared to other storage means, local storage has a relatively high capacity. For example, cookies are limited to 4 kilobytes per domain. But local storage can store up to 5 megabytes of data per domain.\n• Stores only strings: As you learned earlier, local storage can only store string values. You can use the JSON and methods to work around it. But some web developers may not prefer it as it can lead to writing complex code that’s difficult to debug.\n• Security concerns: Data in the local storage can be prone to attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS). As such, you should be cautious when working with sensitive information. It’s advisable to assess security implications and consider other alternatives where necessary.\n• Not accessible to web workers: Local storage is part of the Window object. As such, it’s tied to the main execution thread of the web page. This means it's not accessible to web workers. So if you run any background processes, you cannot use local storage within the web worker scripts.\n\nLocal storage is a feature in modern web browsers that makes it easy for web developers to store and persist data between browser sessions.\n\nCompared to traditional cookies, it provides larger storage capacities. Also, unlike cookies, it does not rely on server-side processes. This reduces the need for frequent server requests and helps improve performance.\n\nIn this article, you learn about how to use local storage. We covered saving, retrieving, and deleting data from local storage. You also learned about some of the benefits of using local storage in your project, and some of its limitations too.\n\nThanks for reading. And happy coding!

        "document": "State management is a core aspect of any modern frontend application. As web apps grow in complexity, persisting state—saving and restoring data even after page reloads or closing the browser—becomes essential to maintaining a seamless user experience. Whether it’s user preferences, cart items, form progress, or login sessions, the ability to persist state enables apps to function more like native desktop or mobile applications, providing a smoother and more intuitive user experience.\n\nThis article will walk you through the best practices for persisting state in frontend applications, focusing on techniques, tools, and strategies you can implement to ensure a reliable and maintainable state persistence mechanism. We will discuss when and where to store data, how to keep it secure, and common pitfalls to avoid.\n\nPersisting state in a frontend application ensures that users’ data and preferences are saved across sessions, enhancing the overall experience and reducing friction. Imagine filling out a long form, closing the tab, and returning later to find everything still in place. Or consider shopping online and adding products to your cart only to return days later and find your cart intact. This level of convenience not only improves user engagement but can also have a direct impact on business metrics, such as conversion rates and user retention.\n\nPersisting state can also help manage complex application logic, improving performance by avoiding unnecessary API calls or reducing reliance on the backend for frequently accessed data. It’s an important strategy for offline-first applications where access to the backend may be intermittent or limited.\n\nPersisting state in frontend applications involves multiple layers of decision-making, including where to store data, how long to store it, and how to manage updates. Let’s break down some of the best practices that can help you implement an effective state persistence strategy.\n\nBefore persisting state, it’s essential to determine where you will store the data. There are several options available, each with its own pros and cons depending on the use case.\n\nLocal storage is a synchronous storage solution that allows you to store key-value pairs in a user’s browser. It has a storage limit of about 5MB per domain and persists even after the browser is closed.\n\nWhen to use: Local storage is ideal for storing simple, non-sensitive data that should persist between sessions. Examples include user preferences, UI settings, or non-sensitive form data.\n• Data persists even after the user closes the browser.\n• It is easy to implement with no need for additional libraries.\n• Not suitable for sensitive data as it lacks encryption and can be accessed by any script on the page.\n• Data is stored in a synchronous manner, which may cause performance issues if used excessively.\n\nSession storage is similar to local storage but only persists data for the duration of the session (i.e., until the browser is closed). It also uses key-value pairs and has a 5MB limit.\n\nWhen to use: Session storage is best for temporary data that should only persist for as long as the session lasts. This can include form progress, non-critical user settings, or temporary API response caching.\n\nExample: Storing a user’s form data until the session ends.\n• Automatically clears when the session ends, reducing the need for manual cleanup.\n• Suitable for short-term data persistence without worrying about cluttering local storage.\n\nLimited to session duration, so it won’t persist data if the user closes and reopens the browser.\n\nIndexedDB is a more complex, asynchronous storage solution designed for storing large amounts of structured data, including files, blobs, and rich objects. It provides more flexibility and is a better choice for data-heavy applications, such as storing large datasets or offline-first applications.\n\nWhen to use: IndexedDB is useful for complex data storage needs such as large user-generated content, offline capabilities, or for applications that need to cache data locally (e.g., progressive web apps).\n\nExample: Caching large sets of API data for offline use.\n• More complex to implement compared to local or session storage.\n\nCookies are small data files stored on the client-side and sent with every HTTP request. They are generally used for tracking, session management, and storing user authentication tokens.\n\nWhen to use: Cookies are useful for storing data that needs to be sent to the server with every request, such as user authentication tokens or session identifiers.\n• Automatically sent to the server with each HTTP request.\n• Can be configured with expiration dates and other security measures.\n• Can lead to performance issues if overused, as cookies are sent with every HTTP request.\n• Vulnerable to security issues like cross-site scripting (XSS) if not handled properly.\n\nWhen persisting sensitive data such as authentication tokens, user information, or any personally identifiable information (PII), it is essential to use encryption. Neither local storage nor session storage provides encryption out of the box, so it’s up to you to ensure that data is protected.\n\nUsing libraries like crypto-js can help encrypt sensitive data before storing it in the browser.\n\nExample: Encrypting and decrypting sensitive data before saving to local storage.\n\nWhen persisting objects or arrays, always serialize the data using JSON.stringify() and deserialize it with JSON.parse() when retrieving it. This ensures that the data is stored correctly and can be easily restored to its original structure.\n\nExample: Storing and retrieving an array of objects in local storage.\n\nFor large-scale applications with complex state requirements, integrating a state management library like Redux or MobX with persistence capabilities can streamline the process. These libraries often provide middleware or plugins that allow you to automatically persist state to local storage or IndexedDB.\n\nExample with Redux: Persisting the Redux store to local storage using redux-persist.\n\nThis setup ensures that whenever the Redux store is updated, the changes are automatically persisted to local storage, and restored when the app reloads.\n\nNot all data should be stored indefinitely. It’s important to implement expiration policies for your persisted state, ensuring that outdated data is cleared or refreshed regularly. You can implement expiration by setting timestamps when storing the data and checking the timestamp when retrieving it.\n\nExample: Implementing an expiration policy in local storage.\n\nWhen working with client-side storage, it’s essential to handle errors gracefully. Not all browsers support every storage mechanism in the same way, and some users may disable certain features like cookies or local storage. Always check for availability and handle errors like or .\n\nWhile it can be tempting to persist everything, not all state needs to be saved between sessions. Avoid storing transient UI state or data that can easily be recalculated or fetched from the server. Over-persisting state can lead to performance issues, security risks, and unnecessary complexity in your code.\n\nIn many frontend applications, especially those that interact heavily with APIs, caching is a crucial technique for persisting state to improve performance. By caching frequently accessed data, you can reduce the need for repetitive API requests and provide users with faster, smoother interactions. Several caching strategies can be implemented, depending on your specific requirements.\n\nThe stale-while-revalidate strategy allows you to serve cached data immediately while revalidating it in the background. This ensures that users get an instant response from the cache while the system silently updates the data for future requests.\n\nIn this example, the cached data is returned immediately if available, while the app fetches the latest data in the background and updates the cache. This pattern is ideal for data that changes periodically, such as user dashboards or news feeds, where providing the most up-to-date information is not critical in real-time.\n\nFor volatile data that changes frequently, you may want to implement cache expiration mechanisms. This ensures that data is updated regularly and users are not presented with outdated information. You can store timestamps alongside the cached data and check if the data has expired before serving it.\n\nIn this case, the cached data is only served if it hasn’t expired. This strategy ensures that users get relatively fresh data while reducing unnecessary API calls.\n\nPersisting state for offline use is particularly important for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), where the goal is to provide seamless functionality even without an internet connection. Service workers can cache important resources and API responses, allowing your app to function when the user is offline.\n\nThis service worker example caches key resources during the installation phase and serves them when the user is offline or the network is slow. You can extend this to cache API responses as well, which allows for offline access to dynamic data such as user content or dashboards.\n\nWhen persisting state across different sessions and devices, ensuring data consistency can become challenging, especially in cases where users work offline and make changes that need to be synchronized with the server later.\n\nIf a user modifies data while offline, and then different changes are made to the same data on the server, you’ll need to handle conflicts when the user comes back online. Strategies such as last-write-wins or merging changes can help manage these conflicts effectively.\n\nThis example showcases how you can synchronize local changes made while offline with the server data, ensuring data consistency without overwriting important information.\n\nOne of the key risks when persisting state in frontend applications is storing sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personally identifiable information (PII). Browser storage, including local storage and session storage, is easily accessible by JavaScript and can be compromised in the event of a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.\n• Never store authentication tokens or sensitive user data directly in local storage or session storage.\n• Use secure cookies with the and flags for storing tokens, as this restricts access to the data from client-side JavaScript and ensures the data is only transmitted over HTTPS.\n• Implement token rotation and expiration policies to reduce the risk of session hijacking.\n\nWhile persisting state can significantly enhance user experience, it’s essential to consider how much data you are storing and how long it should persist. For example, form data can be persisted temporarily (using session storage) to help users who accidentally close the tab, but it’s not necessary to store such data indefinitely.\n\nWhen persisting state, always prioritize data that directly impacts the user experience, such as:\n• Form data that allows users to pick up where they left off.\n• Frequently accessed content that enhances performance, like cached API responses for quick page loads.\n\nAvoid persisting unnecessary UI state, like which tab the user last selected or transient data that can easily be recalculated.\n\nPersisting state in frontend applications can greatly enhance user experience by ensuring that data is not lost between sessions, and by making apps more resilient to reloads and closures. However, it’s essential to use the right strategies to ensure that the state is managed efficiently, securely, and in line with the app’s performance goals.\n\nBy selecting the right storage medium, encrypting sensitive data, using JSON for structured data, leveraging state management libraries, implementing expiration policies, and handling errors gracefully, you can create a robust state persistence mechanism in your frontend application.\n\nAt PixelFree Studio, we specialize in helping developers build high-performance, user-friendly web applications that are optimized for the best possible user experience.

        "document": "The first and most important tip in the list is to include a version in your storage key: after users start using the application and add items to the cart, your code change, and you deliver new versions periodically. What if the structure that you save into localStorage changes (you have a 100% chance it will occur, one day!)?\n\nWhen this happens, and when your newly delivered app tries to read the cart from the storage, it will encounter an old structure that may cause the app to break, or to crash entirely (ie: when you try to read a variable that you introduced in version 1.2 but the user hasn’t visited since 0.5, and did not empty the cache… your app will go boom in this case).\n\nTo solve this, append a version to your storage key.\n\nSo, the idea is that each time our code tries to read the from local storage, it reads the version that goes with it! and nothing else. If there is an old structure, you may think of two options: remove it or migrate it.\n\nKeep track of the recent versions\n\nTo minimize the storage taken on the user’s side, you should always remove entries that correspond to the older version of your code. To do that, keep track of an array of recent versions that should be removed (why not just one ? because you may perform multiple deployments while the user hasn’t visited and refreshed the website’s code ;) so, keep enough versions).\n\nThe user may open multiple tabs displaying the elements in the cart, then removes or adds an element: All tabs should display the same thing at the same time.\n\nTo achieve this, you should be aware of updates that occur in the storage in other tabs: subscribe to the window’s storage event and reload your data (please be aware that the storage event is not triggered in the document that causes it to fire).\n\nFor a smoother developer experience, every addition to the storage should be validated. This is to keep data consistency and warn as early as possible (while typing code) about bugs:\n\nThese tips helped us catch countless bugs in development mode, along with smoother user and developer experience, and practically no bug in production in cart!"
