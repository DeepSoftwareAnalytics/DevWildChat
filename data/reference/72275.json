        "document": "3D models are available in hundreds of file formats, each with different purposes, assorted features, and varying complexity. Although three.js provides many loaders, choosing the right format and workflow will save time and frustration later on. Some formats are difficult to work with, inefficient for realtime experiences, or simply not fully supported at this time.\n\nThis guide provides a workflow recommended for most users, and suggestions for what to try if things don't go as expected.\n\nIf you're new to running a local server, begin with [link:#manual/introduction/Installation installation] first. Many common errors viewing 3D models can be avoided by hosting files correctly.\n\nWhere possible, we recommend using glTF (GL Transmission Format). Both .GLB and .GLTF versions of the format are well supported. Because glTF is focused on runtime asset delivery, it is compact to transmit and fast to load. Features include meshes, materials, textures, skins, skeletons, morph targets, animations, lights, and cameras.\n\nPublic-domain glTF files are available on sites like Sketchfab, or various tools include glTF export:\n\nIf your preferred tools do not support glTF, consider requesting glTF export from the authors, or posting on the glTF roadmap thread.\n\nWhen glTF is not an option, popular formats such as FBX, OBJ, or COLLADA are also available and regularly maintained.\n\nOnly a few loaders (e.g. [page:ObjectLoader]) are included by default with three.js ‚Äî others should be added to your app individually.\n\nOnce you've imported a loader, you're ready to add a model to your scene. Syntax varies among different loaders ‚Äî when using another format, check the examples and documentation for that loader. For glTF, usage with global scripts would be:\n\nSee [page:GLTFLoader GLTFLoader documentation] for further details.\n\nYou've spent hours modeling an artisanal masterpiece, you load it into the webpage, and ‚Äî oh no! üò≠ It's distorted, miscolored, or missing entirely. Start with these troubleshooting steps:\n‚Ä¢ Check the JavaScript console for errors, and make sure you've used an `onError` callback when calling `.load()` to log the result.\n‚Ä¢ View the model in another application. For glTF, drag-and-drop viewers are available for three.js and babylon.js. If the model appears correctly in one or more applications, file a bug against three.js. If the model cannot be shown in any application, we strongly encourage filing a bug with the application used to create the model.\n‚Ä¢ Try scaling the model up or down by a factor of 1000. Many models are scaled differently, and large models may not appear if the camera is inside the model.\n‚Ä¢ Try to add and position a light source. The model may be hidden in the dark.\n‚Ä¢ Look for failed texture requests in the network tab, like `\"C:\\\\Path\\To\\Model\\texture.jpg\"`. Use paths relative to your model instead, such as `images/texture.jpg` ‚Äî this may require editing the model file in a text editor.\n\nAsking for help\n\nIf you've gone through the troubleshooting process above and your model still isn't working, the right approach to asking for help will get you to a solution faster. Post a question on the three.js forum and, whenever possible, include your model (or a simpler model with the same problem) in any formats you have available. Include enough information for someone else to reproduce the issue quickly ‚Äî ideally, a live demo."

        "document": "In the last chapter, we created a simple toy train model using some of the built-in three.js geometries, and it quickly became clear that it would be hard to build anything complex or organic using just these. To create beautiful 3D models, a sophisticated modeling program is required. You can use three.js to build any kind of 3D application, however, building a modeling app from scratch would be a huge amount of work. A much simpler solution is to use an existing program and export your work for use in three.js‚Ä¶ or, cheat, and download any of the millions of amazing models and other scene assets that are available for free in many places around the web.\n\nIn this chapter, we‚Äôll show you how to load some models that were created in Blender, an open-source 3D graphics application that can be used for modeling, scene building, material creation, animation authoring, and more. Once you have created a model in Blender, you can export your work using a 3D format such as glTF, then use the plugin to bring the model into three.js.\n\nThe Best Way to Send 3D Assets Over the Web: glTF\n\nThere have been many attempts at creating a standard 3D asset exchange format over the last thirty years or so. FBX, OBJ (Wavefront) and DAE (Collada) formats were the most popular of these until recently, although they all have problems that prevented their widespread adoption. For example, OBJ doesn‚Äôt support animation, FBX is a closed format that belongs to Autodesk, and the Collada spec is overly complex, resulting in large files that are difficult to load.\n\nHowever, recently, a newcomer called glTF has become the de facto standard format for exchanging 3D assets on the web. glTF (GL Transmission Format), sometimes referred to as the JPEG of 3D, was created by the Kronos Group, the same people who are in charge of WebGL, OpenGL, and a whole host of other graphics APIs. Originally released in 2017, glTF is now the best format for exchanging 3D assets on the web, and in many other fields. In this book, we‚Äôll always use glTF, and if possible, you should do the same. It‚Äôs designed for sharing models on the web, so the file size is as small as possible and your models will load quickly.\n\nHowever, since glTF is relatively new, your favorite application might not have an exporter yet. In that case, you can convert your models to glTF before using them, or use another loader such as the or . All three.js loaders work the same way, so if you do need to use another loader, everything from this chapter will still apply, with only minor differences.\n\nglTF files can contain models, animations, geometries, materials, lights, cameras, or even entire scenes. This means you can create an entire scene in an external program then load it into three.js.\n\nglTF files come in standard and binary form. These have different extensions:\n‚Ä¢ Standard .gltf files are uncompressed and may come with an extra .bin data file.\n‚Ä¢ Binary .glb files include all data in one single file.\n\nBoth standard and binary glTF files may contain textures embedded in the file or may reference external textures. Since binary .glb files are considerably smaller, it‚Äôs best to use this type. On the other hand, uncompressed .gltf are easily readable in a text editor, so they may be useful for debugging purposes.\n\nThere are lots of free glTF models available on the three.js repo, and amongst these are three simple and beautiful models of a parrot, a flamingo, and a stork, created by the talented people at mirada.com. These three models are low poly, meaning they‚Äôll run on even the most low-power of mobile devices, and they are even animated.\n\nYou can find these three files in the editor, in the assets/models/ folder. In this chapter, we‚Äôll load Parrot.glb, Flamingo.glb, and Stork.glb and then add the bird-shaped meshes each file contains to our scene. In the next chapter, we‚Äôll show you how to play the flying animation that is included with each bird.\n\nIf you‚Äôre working locally rather than using the inline code editor, you‚Äôll need to set up a webserver. Otherwise, due to browser security restrictions, you won‚Äôt be able to load these files from your hard drive.\n\nTo load glTF files, first, you need to add the plugin to your app. This works the same way as adding the plugin. You can find the loader in examples/jsm/loaders/GLTFLoader.js on the repo, and we have also included this file in the editor. Go ahead and locate the file now.\n\nImporting and creating an instance of the loader works like this:\n\nYou can use one instance of the loader to load any number of glTF files.\n\nAll three.js loaders have two methods for loading files: the old callback-based method, and the newer Promise based method. Again, refer to chapter A.5 where we cover the difference between these two approaches in detail. Promises allow us to use async functions, which in turn results in much cleaner code, so throughout this book, we will always use .\n\nSet Up Main.js and World.js to Handle Async/Await\n\nThe keyword means ‚Äúwait here until the model has loaded‚Äù. If you have previously dealt with loading models using callbacks or Promises, then will seem almost magical in its simplicity. However, we need to make a few adjustments to our code before we can use it since we can only use inside a function that has been marked as :\n\nAnother issue is that we cannot mark a constructor as async. A common solution to this is to create a separate method.\n\nThis way, the constructor can handle the synchronous setup of the class, as usual, and then the init method will take over for asynchronous setup. We will use this approach, so we need to create a new method.\n\nGo ahead and add an empty method to World now, and make sure you mark it . Splitting the setup into synchronous and asynchronous stages like this gives us full control over the setup of our app. In the synchronous stage, we will create everything that doesn‚Äôt rely on loaded assets, and in the asynchronous stage, we‚Äôll create everything that does.\n\nOver in main.js, first, we must also mark the main function as async. This is required so that we can call the async method.\n\nNow we can call both stages of setting up the World app. First, the synchronous constructor, as usual, then the new method to handle asynchronous tasks.\n\nNo method of loading files is complete unless we can also handle any errors that occur. Errors can be as simple as a typo in the file name, or something more complex like a network error. Fortunately, with async functions, error handling is also simple. At the bottom of main.js, replace this line:\n\nNow any errors will be logged to the console. In a real app, you might want to do more sophisticated error handling, such as displaying a message to the user to let them know that something went wrong. However, while we are in development mode, the most important thing is that all errors are logged to the console where we can see them.\n\nNow everything is set up and we can go ahead and load our first model. Open (or create) the components/birds/birds.js module. Start by importing the , then create an async function. Inside the function, create an instance of the loader, and finally, export the function at the bottom of the file:\n\nThe structure of this new module should be familiar to you since it‚Äôs the same as nearly every other component we have created so far. The only difference is the keyword.\n\nOver in World, update the list of imports:\n\nNow, we‚Äôre ready to load the Parrot.glb file using . Once you have done so, log the loaded data to the console:\n\nNext, call the in :\n\nWe need to take a deeper look at the data we have just loaded before we can add the model to our scene, so for now we‚Äôve simply logged the data to the console. Open up the browser console (press F12). You should see the word Squaaawk! followed by an Object containing the loaded data. This Object contains meshes, animations, cameras, and other data from the file:\n‚Ä¢ is an array of animation clips. Here, there‚Äôs a flying animation. We‚Äôll make use of this in the next chapter.\n‚Ä¢ contains metadata showing this glTF file was created using the Blender exporter.\n‚Ä¢ is an array of cameras. This file doesn‚Äôt contain any cameras, so the array is empty.\n‚Ä¢ contains technical details about the .\n‚Ä¢ is a containing any meshes from the file. This is where we‚Äôll find the parrot model.\n‚Ä¢ : The glTF format supports storing multiple scenes in a single file. In practice, this feature is rarely used.\n\nis a standard property that every JavaScript object has, you can ignore that.\n\nUsually, all you need is , , and (not !) and you can safely ignore everything else.\n\nExtracting data from a glTF file usually follows a predictable pattern, especially if the file contains a single animated model, as these three files do. This means we can create a function and then run it on each of the three files. We‚Äôll do this in a separate module. Open or create the birds/setupModel.js module, and create the function, following the now-familiar pattern:\n\nThe idea of this function is that we can pass in the loaded data and get back the bird model, ready to be added to the scene. Next, import this new module into birds.js, then pass in the loaded data. Finally, return the results for use within World.\n\nExtract the Mesh from the Loaded Data\n\nAt this point, we have the unprocessed loaded data within the function. The next step is to extract the model, and then do any processing to prepare it for use. The amount of work we need to do here depends on the model, and what we want to do with it. Here, all we need to do is extract the mesh, but in the next chapter, we‚Äôll have a bit more work to do as we connect the animation clip to the mesh.\n\nLook at the loaded data in the console again, and expand the . This a , and any meshes that are in the file will be children of the group. These can be accessed using the array. If you look inside there, you‚Äôll see that has only one object inside it, so that must be our parrot model.\n\nUsing this knowledge, we can finish the function:\n\nNote A: if you click the toggle to complete the scene in the editor, then view the array in the console, it will be empty. This is because, by the time you look at it, the mesh has already been removed and added to the scene.\n\nNote B: you could also just add the to your scene since it‚Äôs a group. That would add an additional node to your scene graph but everything will still work. However, it‚Äôs best practice to keep your scene graph as simple as possible, since every node means additional calculations are required to render the scene.\n\nAdd the Mesh to the Scene\n\nOver in World, now returns the parrot mesh and you can add it to the scene:\n\nLoad the Other Two Birds\n\nYou can use a single instance of the to load any number of files. When performing multiple asynchronous operations with async functions, you should (in most cases) use . We go into the reason for this in more detail in the appendix, but here‚Äôs the short version.\n\nFirst, here‚Äôs the obvious way of loading the other two files:\n\nThere‚Äôs a problem with this approach. As we stated above, means wait here until the file has loaded. This means the app will wait until the parrot has fully loaded, then start to load the flamingo, wait until that has fully loaded, and finally start to load the stork. Using this approach, loading will take nearly three times longer than it should.\n\nInstead, we want all three files to load at the same time, and the simplest way of doing this is to use .\n\nThen we can process each file‚Äôs loaded data using the function. Once we do that, here‚Äôs our (nearly complete) function:\n\nOver in World, you now have all three models. Add them to your scene:\n\nJust like visiting the zoo!\n\nIt is possible for models loaded from a glTF file to have a position already specified, but that‚Äôs not the case here, so all three models start at the point $(0,0,0)$, all jumbled together on top of each other. We‚Äôll adjust the position of each bird to make it look like they are flying in formation:\n\nThe birds.js module is now complete. Here‚Äôs the final code:\n\nCenter the Camera on the Parrot\n\nThe very last thing we‚Äôll do is adjust the target. Currently, this is in its default position, the center of the scene. Now that we have moved the birds into formation, this ends up being somewhere around the tail of the parrot. It would look better if the camera focused on the center of the bird rather than its tail. We can easily set this up by copying the into . However, to do so, we need to access within , so first, let‚Äôs convert it to a module-scoped variable.\n\nNow, the controls are accessible from and we can move the target to the center of the parrot.\n\nNext up, we‚Äôll introduce the three.js animation system and show you how to play the animation clips that were loaded alongside the bird models."

        "document": "In the world of web development, creating interactive and visually appealing 3D graphics has always been a challenge. However, with the advent of Three.js, it has become easier than ever to add 3D elements to your web applications. Three.js abstracts away the complexities of WebGL, making it accessible to developers with varying levels of expertise. In this article, we will dive deep into the practical aspects of using Three.js, from setting up your environment to creating complex 3D scenes.\n\nTo begin with Three.js, you need to set up your development environment. Start by including the Three.js library in your project. You can do this by either downloading the library from the official Three.js website or by using a CDN. Once you have Three.js included, you can start creating 3D scenes.\n\nA basic Three.js scene consists of a scene, a camera, and a renderer. The scene is where all your objects will be placed. The camera determines what part of the scene is visible, and the renderer displays the scene on the screen.\n\nFirst, create a scene object. This will act as a container for all your 3D objects. Next, set up the camera. A common choice is the , which simulates the way the human eye sees the world. Finally, create a renderer.\n\nThe renderer will take care of drawing the scene from the perspective of the camera and displaying it on the screen.\n\nOnce you have your scene, camera, and renderer set up, you can start adding objects to your scene. Three.js provides a variety of built-in geometries like cubes, spheres, and more.\n\nTo create a basic object, you need a geometry and a material. The geometry defines the shape, and the material defines how the surface of the object looks.\n\nFor example, to create a simple cube, you can use the and a .\n\nOne of the most exciting aspects of Three.js is the ability to create animations. To animate the scene, you need to create a render loop. This is a function that repeatedly updates the scene and re-renders it.\n\nThis code will create an animation where the cube rotates continuously. The function ensures that the animation runs smoothly at the optimal frame rate.\n\nOnce you are comfortable with the basics, you can explore the more advanced features of Three.js. These include working with complex geometries, materials, lighting, and shadows.\n\nThree.js allows you to create complex geometries beyond the basic shapes. You can create custom geometries by defining the vertices and faces manually. Alternatively, you can use tools like Blender to create 3D models and import them into your Three.js scene.\n\nMaterials in Three.js determine how objects interact with light and how they appear on the screen. There are several types of materials available, such as , , and . Each material has different properties and use cases.\n\nTextures can be applied to materials to give objects a more realistic appearance. You can load textures from images and apply them to your materials.\n\nLighting is a crucial aspect of 3D graphics. Three.js offers various types of lights, including ambient lights, point lights, directional lights, and spotlights. Each type of light has different properties and can be used to create different effects.\n\nShadows add depth and realism to your scene. To enable shadows, you need to set the renderer to cast and receive shadows, and configure your lights and materials accordingly.\n\nBeyond static scenes and basic animations, Three.js allows you to create interactive 3D experiences. Interactivity can significantly enhance user engagement, making your applications more dynamic and engaging.\n\nTo make your 3D scenes interactive, you need to handle user input. Three.js can respond to various input events, such as mouse movements, clicks, and keyboard inputs. One common approach is to use the Raycaster class, which helps you detect objects under the mouse pointer.\n\nThis code changes the color of objects under the mouse pointer. You can extend this to handle clicks, drags, and other user interactions.\n\nThree.js provides built-in controls that make it easy to navigate and interact with your 3D scenes. The OrbitControls, for instance, allow you to rotate, zoom, and pan the camera with mouse or touch inputs.\n\nThese controls are highly configurable and can greatly enhance the user experience in your 3D applications.\n\nParticle systems are used to create effects like smoke, fire, rain, and other phenomena composed of many small particles. Three.js makes it straightforward to create and manage particle systems.\n\nThis creates a simple particle system with randomly positioned particles. You can animate and style particles to create a wide range of effects.\n\nAs your 3D scenes become more complex, optimization becomes crucial to maintain performance and smooth user experience. Here are some advanced techniques and tips for optimizing Three.js applications.\n\nLevel of Detail (LOD) techniques help improve performance by reducing the complexity of objects that are far away from the camera. Three.js supports LOD through the class, which allows you to specify different models for different distances.\n\nThis example demonstrates how to use LOD to manage different levels of detail for a 3D object.\n\nInstancing is a technique that allows you to render multiple instances of the same geometry efficiently. This is particularly useful for rendering large numbers of identical objects, such as trees in a forest or buildings in a cityscape.\n\nUsing instancing, you can render thousands of objects with minimal performance overhead.\n\nTextures can significantly impact performance, especially when using high-resolution images. Optimize textures by:\n‚Ä¢ Using texture atlases to combine multiple textures into a single image.\n\nCulling is the process of not rendering objects that are outside the camera‚Äôs view. Three.js automatically handles frustum culling, but you can also implement custom culling techniques to optimize performance further.\n\nBounding volumes, such as bounding boxes and spheres, can help in efficiently determining whether an object should be rendered.\n\nThis example checks if a mesh‚Äôs bounding box intersects with the camera‚Äôs view frustum before rendering it.\n\nThree.js can be used in a variety of practical applications, from simple visualizations to complex interactive experiences. Let‚Äôs explore a few examples.\n\nThree.js is an excellent tool for creating interactive data visualizations. Whether you‚Äôre visualizing geographic data, network graphs, or scientific datasets, Three.js can help you create compelling visual representations.\n\nThree.js can be used to create virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) experiences. By integrating with WebXR, you can build immersive environments that can be explored using VR headsets or augmented with AR devices.\n\nArtists and game developers can use Three.js to create interactive installations and games. The library‚Äôs flexibility and performance make it suitable for real-time graphics and interactive storytelling.\n\nThree.js can be seamlessly integrated with various other web technologies, frameworks, and libraries, allowing for the creation of comprehensive and complex web applications.\n\nIntegrating Three.js with React can enhance your web applications with 3D graphics while leveraging React‚Äôs component-based architecture. The library simplifies the integration of Three.js with React, providing a declarative approach to creating 3D scenes.\n\nSimilarly, integrating Three.js with Vue.js can be achieved using the library or by directly embedding Three.js code within Vue components. This approach leverages Vue‚Äôs reactivity system to manage 3D graphics.\n\nThree.js can be combined with WebSockets to create real-time collaborative 3D applications. This allows multiple users to interact with the same 3D scene simultaneously.\n\nAs 3D graphics can be demanding on system resources, performance optimization is crucial to ensure smooth and responsive applications. Here are some practical tips to optimize Three.js performance.\n\nDraw calls are the instructions sent to the GPU to draw objects. Minimizing draw calls can significantly improve performance. Techniques to reduce draw calls include:\n‚Ä¢ Instancing: Use the to draw multiple instances of the same geometry efficiently.\n‚Ä¢ Level of Detail (LOD): Adjust the complexity of models based on their distance from the camera.\n‚Ä¢ Using Compressed Textures: Formats like JPEG, PNG, or WebP reduce file size.\n‚Ä¢ Reducing Resolution: Use the smallest possible resolution without sacrificing quality.\n‚Ä¢ Texture Atlases: Combine multiple textures into a single image to reduce the number of texture loads.\n\nLighting calculations can be performance-intensive. Optimize lighting by:\n‚Ä¢ Using Fewer Lights: Minimize the number of dynamic lights.\n‚Ä¢ Baking Lighting: Pre-compute lighting and shadows where possible.\n‚Ä¢ Simple Shaders: Use less complex shaders to reduce computational overhead.\n\nCulling prevents objects that are not visible to the camera from being rendered. Effective culling techniques include:\n‚Ä¢ Frustum Culling: Automatically performed by Three.js to avoid rendering objects outside the camera‚Äôs view.\n‚Ä¢ Occlusion Culling: Skip rendering objects blocked by others in the scene.\n‚Ä¢ Backface Culling: Avoid rendering the back faces of objects when they are not visible.\n\nWeb Workers can offload heavy computations from the main thread, improving performance. Use Web Workers for tasks such as physics simulations and complex calculations.\n\nThree.js allows for advanced shading techniques using shaders written in GLSL. Shaders are programs that run on the GPU, providing greater control over rendering.\n\nShader libraries, such as ShaderToy and GLSL Sandbox, offer pre-made shaders that you can integrate into your Three.js projects for various effects like water, fire, and procedural textures.\n\nPBR is a shading model that aims to render more realistic materials by simulating how light interacts with surfaces. Three.js supports PBR through materials like and .\n\nEffective debugging and troubleshooting are vital for developing robust 3D applications. Three.js offers tools and techniques to help identify and fix issues.\n\nThree.js integrates with browser developer tools, providing essential debugging features. Additionally, the Three.js editor can be used for testing and tweaking scenes.\n\nBlack Screen: If your scene doesn‚Äôt render, check for issues with the renderer setup, camera position, and light configuration.\n\nPerformance Drops: Identify performance bottlenecks using tools like Chrome DevTools‚Äô Performance tab.

        "document": "I would like to make a web-based http log visualizer that is somewhat similar to this native one: http://logstalgia.io/\n\nThe youtube video at the top of that page gives a demonstration of the type of visuals I‚Äôm looking for, though mine is intended to be far more basic. Essentially, I‚Äôd like to connect to a websocket and for each message received on that socket, I would like to emit a particle whose behavior depends on the data in the message. For simplicity sake, let‚Äôs say it should emit one green particle for every message that indicates a 200 http response code and a red particle for every non-200 http response code.\n\nParticles seem to be the right approach for the type of effect I want and the sheer number that would be rendered at any given time, but they don‚Äôt seem to fit in with my need to generate them one at a time individually corresponding to the act of receiving data. As far as I can tell, if I only want one particle generated per message received, then each emitter would be responsible for one particle at a time for the life of each particle. Given the number requests per second in the logs I‚Äôm trying to visualize, the number of emitters would spin out of control pretty fast if the particle life is even a mere few seconds.\n\nThe other option then would be to generate separate meshes for every incoming message and animate them individually, but I imagine this would be horrible for performance at the number of simultaneous particles I need to render - hundreds spawning per second, each with a lifetime of upwards of 5 seconds, meaning at any given time there could easily be several thousand meshes being rendered individually.\n\nWhich option makes sense? Is there a way to make particles work the way I want in a performant manner? Am I underestimating the capabilities of Three.js performance and thus should just create the meshes as needed outside of particles? Or is there another approach entirely that I should look at?\n\nAny general advice or points in the right direction would be really appreciated. It‚Äôs been a fun learning experience so far with ThreeJS, but I feel stuck."

        "document": "Within the three.js animation system you can animate various properties of your models: the bones of a [page:SkinnedMesh skinned and rigged model], morph targets, different material properties (colors, opacity, booleans), visibility and transforms. The animated properties can be faded in, faded out, crossfaded and warped. The weight and time scales of different simultaneous animations on the same object as well as on different objects can be changed independently. Various animations on the same and on different objects can be synchronized.\n\n\n\n To achieve all this in one homogeneous system, the three.js animation system [link:https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/6881 has completely changed in 2015] (beware of outdated information!), and it has now an architecture similar to Unity/Unreal Engine 4. This page gives a short overview of the main components of the system and how they work together.\n\nIf you have successfully imported an animated 3D object (it doesn't matter if it has bones or morph targets or both) ‚Äî for example exporting it from Blender with the [link:https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Blender-IO glTF Blender exporter] and loading it into a three.js scene using [page:GLTFLoader] ‚Äî one of the response fields should be an array named \"animations\", containing the [page:AnimationClip AnimationClips] for this model (see a list of possible loaders below).\n\n\n\n Each `AnimationClip` usually holds the data for a certain activity of the object. If the mesh is a character, for example, there may be one AnimationClip for a walkcycle, a second for a jump, a third for sidestepping and so on.\n\nInside of such an `AnimationClip` the data for each animated property are stored in a separate [page:KeyframeTrack]. Assuming a character object has a [page:Skeleton skeleton], one keyframe track could store the data for the position changes of the lower arm bone over time, a different track the data for the rotation changes of the same bone, a third the track position, rotation or scaling of another bone, and so on. It should be clear, that an AnimationClip can be composed of lots of such tracks.\n\n\n\n Assuming the model has morph targets (for example one morph target showing a friendly face and another showing an angry face), each track holds the information as to how the [page:Mesh.morphTargetInfluences influence] of a certain morph target changes during the performance of the clip.\n\nThe stored data forms only the basis for the animations - actual playback is controlled by the [page:AnimationMixer]. You can imagine this not only as a player for animations, but as a simulation of a hardware like a real mixer console, which can control several animations simultaneously, blending and merging them.\n\nThe `AnimationMixer` itself has only very few (general) properties and methods, because it can be controlled by the [page:AnimationAction AnimationActions]. By configuring an `AnimationAction` you can determine when a certain `AnimationClip` shall be played, paused or stopped on one of the mixers, if and how often the clip has to be repeated, whether it shall be performed with a fade or a time scaling, and some additional things, such crossfading or synchronizing.\n\nIf you want a group of objects to receive a shared animation state, you can use an [page:AnimationObjectGroup].\n\nNote that not all model formats include animation (OBJ notably does not), and that only some three.js loaders support [page:AnimationClip AnimationClip] sequences. Several that do support this animation type:\n\nNote that 3ds max and Maya currently can't export multiple animations (meaning animations which are not on the same timeline) directly to a single file."
