It is a publicly available dataset for remote sensing image captioning task. RSICD contains more than ten thousands remote sensing images which are collected from Google Earth, Baidu Map, MapABC and Tianditu. The images are fixed to 224X224 pixels with various resolutions. The total number of remote sensing images is 10921, with five sentences descriptions per image. The below screenshot shows an example of this data:\n\nThe trained model can be deployed on or to generate captions on a high satellite resolution imagery.\n\nPrepare data that will be used for training\n\nWe need to put the RSICD dataset in a specific format, i.e., a root folder containing a folder named \"images\" and the JSON file containing the annotations named \"annotations.json\". The specific format of the json can be seen here.\n\nLet's set a path to the folder that contains training images and their corresponding labels.\n\nWe'll use the function to create a databunch with the necessary parameters such as , and . A complete list of parameters can be found in the API reference.\n\nTo visualize and get a sense of the training data, we can use the method.\n\nprovides us image captioning model which are based on pretrained convnets, such as ResNet, that act as the backbones. We will use with the backbone parameters as to create our image captioning model. For more details on check out How image_captioning works? and the API reference.\n\nWe will use the method to find an optimum learning rate. It is important to set a learning rate at which we can train a model with good accuracy and speed.\n\nWe will now train the model using the suggested learning rate from the previous step. We can specify how many epochs we want to train for. Let's train the model for 100 epochs.\n\nTo see sample results we can use the method. This method displays the chips from the validation dataset with ground truth (left) and predictions (right). This visual analysis helps in assessing the qualitative results of the trained model.\n\nTo see the quantitative results of our model we will use the method. Bilingual Evaluation Understudy Score(BLEU‚Äôs): is a popular metric that measures the number of sequential words that match between the predicted and the ground truth caption. It compares n-grams of various lengths from 1 through 4 to do this. A perfect match results in a score of 1.0, whereas a perfect mismatch results in a score of 0.0. summarizes how close the generated text is to the expected text.\n\nLet's save the model by giving it a name and calling the method, so that we can it later whenever required. The model is saved by default in a directory called in the initialized earlier, but a custom path can be provided.\n\nWe can perform inferencing on a small test image using the function.\n\nNow that we are satisfied with the model performance on a test image, we are ready to perform model inferencing on our desired images. In our case, we are interested in inferencing on high resolution satellite image.\n\nBefore using the model for inference we need to make some changes in the model_name>.emd file. You can learn more about this file here.\n\nBy default, CropSizeFixed is set to 1. We want to change the CropSizeFixed to 0 so that the size of tile cropped around the features is not fixed. the below code will edit the emd file with CropSizeFixed:0 information.\n\nIn order to perform inferencing in , we need to create a feature class on the map using or tool.\n\nThe Feature Class and the trained model has been provided for reference.

        "document": "Deep learning has been achieving superhuman level performance in computer vision that can do object classification, object detection, or semantic segmentation of different features. On the other hand, natural language processing models perform well on tasks such as named entity recognition, text classification, etc. This guide explains a new model which is a combination of both image and text. Image captioning model, as the name suggests, generates textual captions of an image. Like all supervised learning scenarios, this model also requires labelled training data in order to train a model. Image captioning technique is mostly done on images taken from handheld camera, however, research continues to explore captioning for remote sensing images. These could help describe the features on the map for accessibility purposes. Figure 1 shows an example of a few images from the RSICD dataset [1]. This dataset contains up to 5 unique captions for ~11k images.\n\nThe image captioning model consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder extracts out important features from the image. The decoder takes those features as inputs and uses them to generate the caption. Typically, we use ImageNet Pretrained networks like VGGNet or ResNet as the encoder for the image. The decoder is a language model that takes in current word and image features as an input and outputs the next word. The words are generated sequentially to complete the caption. The neural networks that are quite apt for this case are Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically Long Short Term Memory (LSTMs) or Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). Some research has also been done to incorporate recently transformers as the decoder [4].\n\nAttention Mechanism: The attention mechanism in image captioning attends to a portion of the image before generating the next word. So, the model can decide where to look in the image to generate the next word. This technique had been proposed in Show, Attend, and Tell paper [2]. A figure of this mechanism, along with complete architecture, is shown below.\n\nIn , we have used the architecture shown in Figure 2. It currently supports only the RSICD dataset [1] for image captioning due to the lack of remote sensing captioning data. Other datasets are available, i.e., UC Merced Captions [3] and Sydney Captions [3], but they are not readily accessible. The RSICD dataset size is pretty decent in size as well as diverse, allowing the image captioning model to learn reasonable captions.\n\nWe need to put the RSICD dataset in a specific format, i.e., a root folder containing a folder named \"images\" and the JSON file containing the annotations named \"annotations.json\". The specific format of the json can be seen here.\n\nWhen we have data in this specific format, we can call the function with , we can then use the data object and pass that into the class to train the model using the ArcGIS workflow. The class can be initialized as follows.\n\nAdvanced users can play with the internal architecture of the model by passing a keyword argument as show below.\n\nOnce the model object is created we can use that to train the model using the method.\n‚Ä¢ [2] Xu, K., Ba, J., Kiros, R., Cho, K., Courville, A., Salakhudinov, R., Zemel, R. and Bengio, Y., 2015, June.

        "document": "Technologies applied to turning the sequence of pixels depicted on the image into words with Artificial Intelligence aren‚Äôt as raw as five or more years ago. Better performance, accuracy, and reliability make smooth and efficient image captioning possible in different areas ‚Äì from social media to e-commerce. The automatic creation of tags corresponds with a downloaded photo. This technology could help blind people to discover the world around them.\n\nThis article covers use cases of image captioning technology, its basic structure, advantages, and disadvantages. Also, we deploy a model capable of creating a meaningful description of what is displayed on the input image.\n\nAs a vision-language objective, image captioning could be solved with the help of computer vision and NLP. The AI part onboards CNNs (convolutional neural networks) and RNNs (recurrent neural networks) or any other applicable model to reach the target.\n\nBefore moving forward to the technical details, let‚Äôs find out where image captioning stands.\n\n‚ÄúImage captioning is one of the core computer vision capabilities that can enable a broad range of services,‚Äù said Xuedong Huang, a Microsoft technical fellow and the CTO of Azure AI Cognitive Services in Redmond, Washington.\n\nHe definitely has a point as there is already the vast scope of areas for image captioning technology, namely:\n\nIn this case, the automatic creation of tags by photo is being carried out. For instance, it can simplify users‚Äô life when they upload an image to an online catalog. In this case, AI recognizes the image and generates attributes ‚Äì these can be signatures, categories, or descriptions. The technology could also determine the type of item, material, color, pattern, and fit of clothing for online stores.\n\nAt the same time, image captioning can be implemented by a photo-sharing service or any online catalog to create an automatic meaningful description of the picture for SEO or categorizing purposes. Moreover, captions allow checking whether the image suits the platform‚Äôs rules where it is going to be published. Here it serves as an alternative to CNN categorization and helps to increase traffic and revenue.\n\nNote: Creating descriptions for videos is a much more complicated task. Still, the current state of technology already makes it possible.\n\nTo develop such a solution, we need to convert the picture to text and then to voice. These are two well-known applications of Deep Learning technology.\n\nAn app called Seeing AI developed by Microsoft allows people with eye problems to see the world around them using smartphones. The program can read text when the camera is pointed at it and gives sound prompts. It can recognize both printed and handwritten text, as well as identify objects and people.\n\nGoogle also introduced a tool that can create a text description for the image, allowing blind people or those who have eyesight problems to understand the context of the image or graphic. This machine learning tool consists of several layers. The first model recognizes text and hand-written digits in the image. Then another model recognizes simple objects of the surrounding world‚Äìlike cars, trees, animals, etc. And a third layer is an advanced model capable of finding out the main idea in the full-fledged textual description.\n\nImage caption generated with the help of an AI-based tool is already available for Facebook and Instagram. In addition, the model becomes smarter all the time, learning to recognize new objects, actions, and patterns.\n\nFacebook created a system capable of creating Alt text descriptions nearly five years ago. Nowadays, it has become more accurate. Previously, it described an image using general words, but now this system can generate a detailed description.\n\nLogo identification with help of AI\n\n\n\nImage captioning technology is being used in AI app development with other AI technologies as well. For instance, DeepLogo is a neural network based on TensorFlow Object Detection API. And it can recognize logotypes. The name of the identified logotype appears as a caption on the image. Our research on the GAN-based logotype synthesis model could bring light to how GANs work.\n\nKeeping in mind possible use cases, we applied a model that creates a meaningful text description for pictures. For example, the caption can describe an action and objects that are the main objects on each image. For training, we used Microsoft COCO 2014 dataset.\n\nCOCO dataset is large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset. It contains about 1.5 million different objects divided into 80 categories. Each image is annotated with five human-generated captions.\n\nWe applied Andrej Karpathy‚Äôs training, validation, and test splits for dividing datasets to train, validate, and test parts. Also, we needed Metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, CIDEr, SPICE, to evaluate results.\n\nTypically, baseline architecture for image captioning encodes the input into a fixed form and decodes it, word by word, into a sequence.\n\nThe Encoder encodes the input image with three color channels into a smaller image with ‚Äúlearned‚Äù channels. This smaller encoded image is a summary representation of all that‚Äôs useful in the original image. For encoding, any CNN architecture can be applied. Also, we can use transfer learning for the encoder part.\n\nThe Decoder looks at the encoded image and generates a caption word by word. Then, each predicted word is used to generate the next word.\n\nBefore moving forward, take a look at what we have received as a result of the model creation and testing with the Meshed-Memory transformer model.\n\nAI-based image captioning is now always accurate\n\nWe also studied examples that led to errors. There are several reasons why errors appear. The most common errors are related to poor image quality, and the absence of certain elements in the initial dataset. The model was trained on a dataset with general pictures, so it makes mistakes in cases when it does not know the content, or is unable to identify it correctly. This is the same way the human brain works.\n\nHere is another case to illustrate how Neural Networks operate. There were no tigers in the dataset used for training the model, so it is unable to identify tigers. Instead, AI picked the closest object it knows ‚Äì it is quite the same, as our brain deals with the unknown.\n\nThis is the first model to compare. The Up-Down mechanism combines Bottom-Up and the Top-Down attention mechanism.\n\nFaster R-CNN is used to establish the connection between object detection and image captioning tasks. The Region proposal model is pre-trained on object detection datasets due to leveraging cross-domain knowledge. Moreover, unlike some other attention mechanisms, both models use one-pass attention with the Up-Down mechanism.\n\nFaster R-CNN (fig 5a) is used for image feature extraction. Faster R-CNN is an object detection model designed to identify objects belonging to certain classes and localize them with bounding boxes. Faster R-CNN detects objects in two stages.\n\nThe first stage, described as a Region Proposal Network (RPN), predicts object proposals. Using greedy non-maximum suppression with an intersection-over-union (IoU) threshold, the top box proposals are selected as input to the second stage.\n\nAt the second stage, region of interest (RoI) pooling is used to extract a small feature map (e.g. 14√ó14) for each box proposal. These feature maps are then batched together as input to the final layers of the CNN. Thus, the final model output consists of a softmax distribution over class labels and class-specific bounding box refinements for each box proposal. The scheme is taken from the official poster.\n\nThis is LSTM with an added up-down attention mechanism. Given a set of image features V, the proposed captioning model uses a ‚Äòsoft‚Äô top-down attention mechanism to weigh each feature during caption generation. At a high level, the captioning model is composed of two LSTM layers.\n\nAnother model that we took to solve the image captioning task is Meshed-Memory Transformer. It consists of encoder and decoder parts. Both of them are made of stacks of attentive layers. The encoder also includes feed-forward layers, and the decoder has a learnable mechanism with weighting.\n\nRegions of the image are encoded in a multi-level fashion. The model takes into account both low-level and high-level relations. Learned knowledge is encoded as memory vectors. Layers of encoder and decoder parts are connected in a mesh-like structure. The decoder reads from the output of each encoding layer and performs self-attention on words and cross attention over all encoding layers after that results being modulated and summed.\n\nSo, the model can use not only the visual content of the image but also a prior knowledge of the encoder. The schemes are taken from the official paper.\n\nComparison of Two Models for image captioning\n\nBased on our research, we‚Äôre able to compare the Up-down model and the M2transform model, as they were trained on the same data. The table below provides a summary of both models.\n\nBoth used models showed fairly good results. With their help, we can generate meaningful captions for most of the images from our dataset. Moreover, thanks to the feature pre-extracting with Faster-RCNN, pre-trained on the huge Visual Genome dataset, the model is able to recognize many objects and actions from people‚Äôs everyday life, and therefore describe them correctly.\n\nSo what is the difference?\n\nThe Updown model is faster and more lightweight than the M2Transformer. The reason is that the M2Transformer uses more techniques, like additional (‚Äúmeshed‚Äù) connections between encoder and decoder, and memory vectors for remembering the past experience. Also, these models use different mechanisms of attention.\n\nUpdown attention can be performed in a single pass, while multi-headed attention that is used in M2Transformer should be running in parallel several times. However, according to the obtained metrics, M2Transormer achieved better results. With its help, we can generate more correct and varied captions. M2Transformer predictions contain fewer inaccuracies in description both for pictures from the dataset and for some other related images. Therefore, it performs the main task better.\n\nWe compared two models, but there are also other approaches to the task of image captioning. It‚Äôs possible to change decoder and encoder, use various word vectors, combine datasets, and apply transfer learning.\n\nThe model could be improved to achieve better results suitable for the particular business, either as an application for people with vision problems or as additional tools embedded in e-commerce platforms. To achieve this goal, the model should be trained on relevant datasets. For example, for a system to correctly describe cloth, it is better to run training on datasets with clothes."

        "document": "This is the sixth and last article of this series! Thank you so much if you have been following this series & I hope you learned something from it. Do suggest a new series to me!\n\nDeploying a machine learning model is an essential step in bringing a model to production. It allows the model to be used in real-world applications, providing value to users and businesses. However, deploying a model can be complex and requires careful consideration of the application‚Äôs requirements and the best practices for deploying and monitoring models in production. This article will discuss the different types of model deployment and the best practices for deploying machine learning models.\n\nThere are several ways to deploy a machine learning model, depending on the requirements of the application. Here are some common types of model deployment:\n\nCloud deployment involves hosting the machine learning model on a cloud platform, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure. This allows the model to be accessed by remote applications and services. Cloud deployment is ideal for applications that require real-time predictions, as it will enable the model to be scaled up or down based on the demand.\n\nEdge deployment involves hosting the machine learning model on an edge device, such as a mobile phone, a Raspberry Pi, or an IoT device. This allows the model to be used in environments with limited or no internet connectivity. Edge deployment is ideal for applications that require offline predictions, such as an image or speech recognition.\n\nContainer deployment involves packaging the machine learning model in containers like Docker or Kubernetes. This allows the model to be easily deployed and scaled on any platform that supports containers. Container deployment is ideal for applications that require flexibility and portability, as it allows the model to be deployed on any platform that supports containers.\n\nOn-device deployment involves running the machine learning model directly on a device, such as a mobile phone or a smartwatch. This allows the model to be used in real-time applications without needing internet connectivity or cloud services. On-device deployment is ideal for applications that require real-time predictions, such as speech recognition or natural language processing.\n\nDeploying a machine learning model is a complex task that requires careful consideration of the application‚Äôs requirements and the best practices for deploying and monitoring models in production. This section will discuss the best practices for deploying machine learning models.\n\nChoosing the right platform is critical for the success of a machine-learning model in production. Each model deployment type has advantages and disadvantages, and choosing the right platform for your specific use case is essential. Cloud deployment is ideal for applications that require real-time predictions, as it allows the model to be scaled up or down based on the demand. Edge deployment is suitable for applications that require offline predictions, such as an image or speech recognition. Container deployment is ideal for applications that require flexibility and portability, as it allows the model to be deployed on any platform that supports containers. On-device deployment is suitable for applications that require real-time predictions, such as speech recognition or natural language processing.\n\nBefore deploying the model, it is essential to test it thoroughly to ensure that it is performing well and that there are no bugs or errors. This can be done using cross-validation, A/B testing, or simulation. Cross-validation involves splitting the data into training and validation sets and evaluating the model‚Äôs performance on the validation set. A/B testing compares the model‚Äôs performance against a baseline or a previous version of the model. Simulation involves creating data to test the model‚Äôs performance under different conditions.\n\nOnce the model is deployed, it is essential to monitor it regularly to ensure that it is still performing well and that there are no issues or errors. This can be done using various monitoring tools and techniques, such as logging, metrics, and alerts. Logging involves recording events and activities related to the model, such as input data, output data, and errors. Metrics involve tracking performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Alerts involve sending notifications when certain events or conditions occur, such as when the model‚Äôs performance drops below a certain threshold.\n\nVersion control is essential for maintaining a history of changes to the model and ensuring that the correct version is being used in production. This can be done using tools such as Git or Docker. Version control allows developers to track changes to the model over time, collaborate on changes, and revert to previous versions if necessary.\n\nSecurity is crucial to model deployment, as machine learning models can be vulnerable to attacks and potentially leak sensitive data. Implementing security measures such as access control, encryption, and secure communication protocols is essential. Access control involves limiting access to the model and its data to authorized users or applications. Encryption protects the model and its data by encrypting it using secure algorithms. Secure communication protocols involve using specific communication channels such as HTTPS or SSL/TLS.\n\nDocumentation is essential for ensuring that other developers or users can easily understand and use the model. This can include documentation on the model architecture, input and output formats, and usage examples. Documentation lets developers know how the model works, how to use it, and how to integrate it into their applications.\n\nCollaboration is essential for ensuring that the model is being used effectively and providing users value. This can include collaboration with other developers, stakeholders, or users. Collaboration allows developers to share knowledge, expertise, and feedback on the model and to ensure that the model meets the users‚Äô needs.\n\nDeploying machine learning models can be complex, requiring developers to carefully consider the application‚Äôs requirements and choose the right tools and platforms to deploy and monitor the models in production. This section will discuss some of the most popular devices and platforms for model deployment and how they can be used to deploy machine learning models.\n\nAmazon SageMaker is a fully-managed platform for building, training, and deploying machine learning models at scale on AWS. It provides various tools and features for building and deploying models, including pre-built algorithms and frameworks, custom algorithms, and managed services for training and deploying models. It also supports everyday machine learning tasks such as data labeling, processing, and model evaluation.\n\nHere is an example of how to deploy a machine-learning model using Amazon SageMaker:\n\nGoogle Cloud AI Platform builds, trains, and deploys machine learning models on GCP. It provides various tools and features for building and deploying models, including pre-built algorithms and frameworks, custom algorithms, and managed services for training and deploying models.

It provides various tools and features for helping models, including a flexible API for defining serving functions, support for different model formats and protocols, and built-in support for monitoring and logging.\n\nHere is an example of how to deploy a machine learning model using TensorFlow Serving:\n\nHeroku is a platform for deploying web applications and APIs, including machine learning models. It provides a range of tools and features for building and deploying web applications, such as language support for Python, Ruby, and Node.js, as well as add-ons for databases, caching, and email. Heroku also provides a range of machine learning add-ons, such as the PredictionIO add-on, which can deploy machine learning models as REST APIs.\n\nHere is an example of how to deploy a machine-learning model using Heroku:\n\nIn conclusion, several tools and platforms are available for deploying machine learning models, each with strengths and weaknesses. Choosing the right tool or platform for your project depends on several factors, including the application requirements, the model‚Äôs size and complexity, and the skill level of the development team. By following best practices for model deployment, such as testing the model before deployment, monitoring the model regularly, and using version control, developers can ensure that their models are deployed successfully and performing well in production. Ultimately, successful model deployment requires careful consideration of the specific needs and goals of the project."

And while ML development alternatives like AutoML are mentioned in Use recommended tools and products, this document focuses primarily on custom-trained models.\n\nBefore following the best practices in this document, we recommend that you read Introduction to Vertex AI.\n\nThis document assumes the following:\n‚Ä¢ You are primarily using Google Cloud services; hybrid and on-premises approaches are not addressed in this document.\n‚Ä¢ You plan to collect training data and store it in Google Cloud.\n‚Ä¢ You have an intermediate-level knowledge of ML, big data tools, and data preprocessing, as well as a familiarity with Cloud Storage, BigQuery, and Google Cloud fundamentals.\n\nIf you are new to ML, check out Google's ML Crash Course.\n\nThe following table lists recommended tools and products for each phase of the ML workflow as outlined in this document:\n\nGoogle offers AutoML, forecasting with Vertex AI, and BigQuery ML as prebuilt training routine alternatives to Vertex AI custom-trained model solutions. The following table provides recommendations about when to use these options for Vertex AI.\n\nWe recommend that you use the following best practices when you set up your ML environment:\n‚Ä¢ Use Vertex AI Workbench instances for experimentation and development.\n‚Ä¢ Store your ML resources and artifacts based on your corporate policy.\n\nUse Vertex AI Workbench instances for experimentation and development\n\nRegardless of your tooling, we recommend that you use Vertex AI Workbench instances for experimentation and development, including writing code, starting jobs, running queries, and checking status. Vertex AI Workbench instances let you access all of Google Cloud's data and AI services in a simple, reproducible way.\n\nVertex AI Workbench instances also give you a secure set of software and access patterns right out of the box. It is a common practice to customize Google Cloud properties like network and Identity and Access Management, and software (through a container) associated with a Vertex AI Workbench instance. For more information, see Introduction to Vertex AI and Introduction to Vertex AI Workbench instances.\n\nAlternatively, you can use Colab Enterprise, which is a collaborative managed notebook environment that uses the security and compliance capabilities of Google Cloud.\n\nCreate a Vertex AI Workbench instance for each member of your data science team. If a team member is involved in multiple projects, especially projects that have different dependencies, we recommend using multiple instances, treating each instance as a virtual workspace. Note that you can stop Vertex AI Workbench instances when they are not being used.\n\nStore your ML resources and artifacts based on your corporate policy\n\nThe simplest access control is to store both your raw and Vertex AI resources and artifacts, such as datasets and models, in the same Google Cloud project. More typically, your corporation has policies that control access. In cases where your resources and artifacts are stored across projects, you can configure your corporate cross-project access control with Identity and Access Management (IAM).\n\nUse Vertex AI SDK for Python, a Pythonic way to use Vertex AI for your end-to-end model building workflows, which works seamlessly with your favorite ML frameworks including PyTorch, TensorFlow, XGBoost, and scikit-learn.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the Google Cloud console, which supports the functionality of Vertex AI as a user interface through the browser.\n\nWe recommend the following best practices for ML development:\n\nML development addresses preparing the data, experimenting, and evaluating the model. When solving a ML problem, it is typically necessary to build and compare many different models to figure out what works best.\n\nTypically, data scientists train models using different architectures, input data sets, hyperparameters, and hardware. Data scientists evaluate the resulting models by looking at aggregate performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall on test datasets. Finally, data scientists evaluate the performance of the models against particular subsets of their data, different model versions, and different model architectures.\n\nThe data used to train a model can originate from any number of systems, for example, logs from an online service system, images from a local device, or documents scraped from the web.\n\nRegardless of your data's origin, extract data from the source systems and convert to the format and storage (separate from the operational source) optimized for ML training. For more information on preparing training data for use with Vertex AI, see Train and use your own models.\n\nIf you're working with structured or semi-structured data, we recommend that you store all data in BigQuery, following BigQuery's recommendation for project structure. In most cases, you can store intermediate, processed data in BigQuery as well. For maximum speed, it's better to store materialized data instead of using views or subqueries for training data.\n\nRead data out of BigQuery using the BigQuery Storage API. For artifact tracking, consider using a managed tabular dataset. The following table lists Google Cloud tools that make it easier to use the API:\n\nStore these data in large container formats on Cloud Storage. This applies to sharded TFRecord files if you're using TensorFlow, or Avro files if you're using any other framework.\n\nCombine many individual images, videos, or audio clips into large files, as this will improve your read and write throughput to Cloud Storage. Aim for files of at least 100mb, and between 100 and 10,000 shards.\n\nTo enable data management, use Cloud Storage buckets and directories to group the shards. For more information, see Product overview of Cloud Storage.\n\nUse data labeling services with the Google Cloud console\n\nYou can create and import training data through the Vertex AI page in the Google Cloud console. By using the prompt and tuning capabilities of Gemini, you can manage text data with customized classification, entity extraction, and sentiment analysis. There are also data labeling solutions on the Google Cloud console Marketplace, such as Labelbox and Snorkel Flow.\n\nYou can use Vertex AI Feature Store to create, maintain, share, and serve ML features in a central location. It's optimized to serve workloads that need low latency, and lets you store feature data in a BigQuery table or view. To use Vertex AI Feature Store, you must create an online store instance and define your feature views. BigQuery stores all the feature data, including historical feature data to allow you to work offline.\n\nUse Vertex AI TensorBoard and Vertex AI Experiments for analyzing experiments\n\nWhen developing models, use Vertex AI TensorBoard to visualize and compare specific experiments‚Äîfor example, based on hyperparameters. Vertex AI TensorBoard is an enterprise-ready managed service with a cost-effective, secure solution that lets data scientists and ML researchers collaborate by making it seamless to track, compare, and share their experiments. Vertex AI TensorBoard enables tracking experiment metrics like loss and accuracy over time, visualizing the model graph, projecting embeddings to a lower dimensional space, and much more.\n\nUse Vertex AI Experiments to integrate with Vertex ML Metadata and to log and build linkage across parameters, metrics, and dataset and model artifacts.\n\nTraining a model within the Vertex AI Workbench instance may be sufficient for small datasets, or subsets of a larger dataset. It may be helpful to use the training service for larger datasets or for distributed training. Using the Vertex AI training service is also recommended to productionize training even on small datasets if the training is carried out on a schedule or in response to the arrival of additional data.\n\nTo maximize your model's predictive accuracy use hyperparameter tuning, the automated model enhancer provided by the Vertex AI training service which takes advantage of the processing infrastructure of Google Cloud and Vertex AI Vizier to test different hyperparameter configurations when training your model. Hyperparameter tuning removes the need to manually adjust hyperparameters over the course of numerous training runs to arrive at the optimal values.\n\nTo learn more about hyperparameter tuning, see Overview of hyperparameter tuning and Create a hyperparameter tuning job.\n\nUse a Vertex AI Workbench instance to understand your models\n\nUse a Vertex AI Workbench instance to evaluate and understand your models. In addition to built-in common libraries like scikit-learn, Vertex AI Workbench instances include the What-if Tool (WIT) and Language Interpretability Tool (LIT). WIT lets you interactively analyze your models for bias using multiple techniques, while LIT helps you understand natural language processing model behavior through a visual, interactive, and extensible tool.\n\nUse feature attributions to gain insights into model predictions\n\nVertex Explainable AI is an integral part of the ML implementation process, offering feature attributions to provide insights into why models generate predictions. By detailing the importance of each feature that a model uses as input to make a prediction, Vertex Explainable AI helps you better understand your model's behavior and build trust in your models.\n\nFor more information about Vertex Explainable AI, see:\n\nWe recommend the following best practices for data preparation:\n\nThe recommended approach for processing your data depends on the framework and data types you're using. This section provides high-level recommendations for common scenarios.\n\nUse BigQuery to process structured and semi-structured data\n\nUse BigQuery for storing unprocessed structured or semi-structured data. If you're building your model using BigQuery ML, use the transformations built into BigQuery for preprocessing data. If you're using AutoML, use the transformations built into AutoML for preprocessing data. If you're building a custom model, using the BigQuery transformations may be the most cost-effective method.\n\nFor large datasets, consider using partitioning in BigQuery. This practice can improve query performance and cost efficiency.\n\nWith large volumes of data, consider using Dataflow, which uses the Apache Beam programming model. You can use Dataflow to convert the unstructured data into binary data formats like TFRecord, which can improve performance of data ingestion during the training process.\n\nAlternatively, if your organization has an investment in an Apache Spark codebase and skills, consider using Dataproc. Use one-off Python scripts for smaller datasets that fit into memory.\n\nIf you need to perform transformations that are not expressible in Cloud SQL or are for streaming, you can use a combination of Dataflow and the pandas library.\n\nAfter your data is pre-processed for ML, you may want to consider using a managed dataset in Vertex AI. Managed datasets enable you to create a clear link between your data and custom-trained models, and provide descriptive statistics and automatic or manual splitting into train, test, and validation sets.\n\nManaged datasets are not required; you may choose not to use them if you want more control over splitting your data in your training code, or if lineage between your data and model isn't critical to your application.\n\nFor more information, see Datasets and Using a managed dataset in a custom training application.\n\nWe recommend the following best practices for ML training:\n\nIn ML training, operationalized training refers to the process of making model training repeatable by tracking repetitions, and managing performance. Although Vertex AI Workbench instances are convenient for iterative development on small datasets, we recommend that you operationalize your code to make it reproducible and able to scale to large datasets. In this section, we discuss tooling and best practices for operationalizing your training routines.\n\nWe recommend that you run your code in either Vertex AI training service or orchestrate with Vertex AI Pipelines. Optionally, you can run your code directly in Deep Learning VM Images, Deep Learning Containers, or Compute Engine. However, we advise against this approach if you are using features of Vertex AI such as automatic scaling and burst capability.\n\nTo operationalize training job execution on Vertex AI, you can create training pipelines. A training pipeline, which is different from a general ML pipeline, encapsulates training jobs. To learn more about training pipelines, see Creating training pipelines and REST Resource: .\n\nUse training checkpoints to save the current state of your experiment\n\nThe ML workflow in this document assumes that you're not training interactively. If your model fails and isn't checkpointed, the training job or pipeline will finish and the data will be lost because the model isn't in memory. To prevent this scenario, make it a practice to always use training checkpoints to ensure you don't lose state.\n\nWe recommend that you save training checkpoints in Cloud Storage. Create a different folder for each experiment or training run.\n\nTo learn more about checkpoints, see Training checkpoints for TensorFlow Core, Saving and loading a General Checkpoint in PyTorch, and ML Design Patterns.\n\nFor custom-trained models or custom containers, store your model artifacts in a Cloud Storage bucket, where the bucket's region matches the regional endpoint you're using for production. See Bucket regions for more information.\n\nCloud Storage supports object versioning. To provide a mitigation against accidental data loss or corruption, enable object versioning in Cloud Storage.\n\nStore your Cloud Storage bucket in the same Google Cloud project. If your Cloud Storage bucket is in a different Google Cloud project, you need to grant Vertex AI access to read your model artifacts.\n\nIf you're using a Vertex AI prebuilt container, ensure that your model artifacts have filenames that exactly match these examples:\n\nTo learn how to save your model in the form of one or more model artifacts, see Exporting model artifacts for prediction.\n\nOften, a model will use a subset of features sourced from Vertex AI Feature Store. The features in Vertex AI Feature Store will already be ready for online serving. For any new features created by data scientist by sourcing data from the data lake, we recommend scheduling the corresponding data processing and feature engineering jobs (or ideally Dataflow) to regularly compute the new feature values at the required cadence, depending upon feature freshness needs, and ingesting them into Vertex AI Feature Store for online or batch serving.\n\nWe recommend the following best practices for model deployment and serving:\n\nModel deployment and serving refers to putting a model into production. The output of the training job is one or more model artifacts stored on Cloud Storage, which you can upload to Model Registry so the file can be used for prediction serving. There are two types of prediction serving: batch prediction is used to score batches of data at a regular cadence, and online prediction is used for near real-time scoring of data for live applications. Both approaches let you obtain predictions from trained models by passing input data to a cloud-hosted ML model and getting inferences for each data instance.To learn more, see Getting batch predictions and Get online predictions from custom-trained models.\n\nTo lower latency for peer-to-peer requests between the client and the model server, use Vertex AI private endpoints. Private endpoints are particularly useful if your application that makes the prediction requests and the serving binary are within the same local network. You can avoid the overhead of internet routing and make a peer-to-peer connection using Virtual Private Cloud.\n\nSpecify the number and types of machines you need\n\nTo deploy your model for prediction, choose hardware that is appropriate for your model, like different central processing unit (CPU) virtual machine (VM) types or graphics processing unit (GPU) types. For more information, see Specifying machine types or scale tiers.\n\nIn addition to deploying the model, you'll need to determine how you're going to pass inputs to the model. If you're using batch prediction you can fetch data from the data lake, or from the Vertex AI Feature Store batch serving API. If you are using online prediction, you can send input instances to the service and it returns your predictions in the response. For more information, see Response body details.\n\nIf you are deploying your model for online prediction, you need a low latency, scalable way to serve the inputs or features that need to be passed to the model's endpoint. You can either do this by using one of the many Database services on Google Cloud, or you can use Vertex AI Feature Store's online serving API. The clients calling the online prediction endpoint can first call the feature serving solution to fetch the feature inputs, and then call the prediction endpoint with those inputs. You can serve multiple models to the same endpoint, for example, to gradually replace the model. Alternatively, you can deploy models to multiple endpoints,for example, in testing and production, by sharing resources across deployments.\n\nStreaming ingestion lets you make real-time updates to feature values. This method is useful when having the latest available data for online serving is a priority. For example, you can ingest streaming event data and, within a few seconds, Vertex AI Feature Store streaming ingestion makes that data available for online serving scenarios.\n\nYou can additionally customize the input (request) and output (response) handling and format to and from your model server by using custom prediction routines.\n\nIf you use the online prediction service, in most cases we recommend that you turn on automatic scaling by setting minimum and maximum nodes. For more information, see Get predictions for a custom trained model. To ensure a high availability service level agreement (SLA), set automatic scaling with a minimum of two nodes.\n\nTo learn more about scaling options, see Scaling ML predictions.\n\nWe recommend the following best practices for ML workflow orchestration:\n\nVertex AI provides ML workflow orchestration to automate the ML workflow with Vertex AI Pipelines, a fully managed service that lets you retrain your models as often as necessary. While retraining enables your models to adapt to changes and maintain performance over time, consider how much your data will change when choosing the optimal model retraining cadence.\n\nML orchestration workflows work best for customers who have already designed and built their model, put it into production, and want to determine what is and isn't working in the ML model. The code you use for experimentation will likely be useful for the rest of the ML workflow with some modification. To work with automated ML workflows, you need to be fluent in Python, understand basic infrastructure like containers, and have ML and data science knowledge.\n\nUse Vertex AI Pipelines to orchestrate the ML workflow\n\nWhile you can manually start each data process, training, evaluation, test, and deployment, we recommend that you use Vertex AI Pipelines to orchestrate the flow. For detailed information, see MLOps level 1: ML pipeline automation.\n\nWe recommend Kubeflow Pipelines SDK for most users who want to author managed pipelines. Kubeflow Pipelines is flexible, letting you use code to construct pipelines. It also provides Google Cloud pipeline components, which lets you include Vertex AI functionality like AutoML in your pipeline. To learn more about Kubeflow Pipelines, see Kubeflow Pipelines and Vertex AI Pipelines.\n\nUse Ray on Vertex AI for distributed ML workflows\n\nRay provides a general and unified distributed framework to scale machine learning workflows through a Python open-source, scalable, and distributed computing framework. This framework can help to solve the challenges that come from having a variety of distributed frameworks in your ML ecosystem, such as having to deal with multiple modes of task parallelism, scheduling, and resource management. You can use Ray on Vertex AI to develop applications on Vertex AI.\n\nWe recommend that you use the following best practices to organize your artifacts:\n\nArtifacts are outputs resulting from each step in the ML workflow. It's a best practice to organize them in a standardized way.\n\nStore your artifacts in these locations:\n\nUse a source control repository for pipeline definitions and training code\n\nYou can use source control to version control your ML pipelines and the custom components you build for those pipelines. Use Artifact Registry to store, manage, and secure your Docker container images without making them publicly visible.\n\nOnce you deploy your model into production, you need to monitor performance to ensure that the model is performing as expected. Vertex AI provides two ways to monitor your ML models:\n‚Ä¢ Skew detection: This approach looks for the degree of distortion between your model training and production data\n‚Ä¢ Drift detection: In this type of monitoring, you're looking for drift in your production data. Drift occurs when the statistical properties of the inputs and the target, which the model is trying to predict, change over time in unforeseen ways. This causes problems because the predictions could become less accurate as time passes.\n\nModel monitoring works for structured data, like numerical and categorical features, but not for unstructured data, like images. For more information, see Monitoring models for feature skew or drift.\n\nAs much as possible, use skew detection because knowing that your production data has deviated from your training data is a strong indicator that your model isn't performing as expected in production. For skew detection, set up the model monitoring job by providing a pointer to the training data that you used to train your model.\n\nIf you don't have access to the training data, turn on drift detection so that you'll know when the inputs change over time.\n\nUse drift detection to monitor whether your production data is deviating over time. For drift detection, enable the features you want to monitor and the corresponding thresholds to trigger an alert.\n\nTune the thresholds used for alerting so you know when skew or drift occurs in your data. Alert thresholds are determined by the use case, the user's domain expertise, and by initial model monitoring metrics. To learn how to use monitoring to create dashboards or configure alerts based on the metrics, see Cloud monitoring metrics.\n\nUse feature attributions to detect data drift or skew\n\nYou can use feature attributions in Vertex Explainable AI to detect data drift or skew as an early indicator that model performance may be degrading. For example, if your model originally relied on five features to make predictions in your training and test data, but the model began to rely on entirely different features when it went into production, feature attributions would help you detect this degradation in model performance.\n\nThis is particularly useful for complex feature types, like embeddings and time series, which are difficult to compare using traditional skew and drift methods. With Vertex Explainable AI, feature attributions can indicate when model performance is degrading.\n\nBigQuery ML model monitoring is a set of tools and functionalities that helps you track and evaluate the performance of your ML models over time. Model monitoring is essential for maintaining model accuracy and reliability in real-world applications. We recommend that you monitor for the following issues:\n‚Ä¢ Data skew: This issue happens when feature value distributions differ between training and serving data. Training statistics, which are saved during model training, enable skew detection without needing the original data.\n‚Ä¢ Data drift: Real-world data often changes over time. Model monitoring helps you identify when the input data that your model sees in production (serving data) starts to differ significantly from the data that it was trained on (training data). This drift can lead to degraded performance.\n‚Ä¢ Advanced data skew or drift: When you want fine-grained skew or drift statistics, monitor for advanced data skew or drift.\n‚Ä¢ Practitioners guide to Machine Learning Operations (MLOps): A framework for continuous delivery and automation of ML\n‚Ä¢ For an overview of architectual principles and recommendations that are specific to AI and ML workloads in Google Cloud, see the AI and ML perspective in the Well-Architected Framework.\n‚Ä¢ For more reference architectures, diagrams, and best practices, explore the Cloud Architecture Center."

        "document": "Deploying machine learning (ML) models into production can feel like navigating a labyrinth.\n\nYou've spent weeks‚Äîor even months‚Äîdeveloping a model that seems flawless in the lab, but when it comes time to deploy, unexpected obstacles arise. These challenges often deter data science teams and stall innovative projects.\n\nBut it doesn't have to be this way. By understanding the common hurdles and planning strategically, you can smooth the path from development to deployment. Let's explore the key aspects that can make or break the success of your ML model in production.\n\nDeploying machine learning models into production presents unique challenges that hinder their widespread adoption. Many data science models never reach production due to the complexities involved in the deployment process and the silos between data science and engineering teams.\n\nDeployment requires a different skill set compared to model development, necessitating expertise in infrastructure, software engineering, and DevOps. This gap often leads to a discrepancy between the number of initiated data science projects and those successfully deployed.\n\nBridging the gap between data scientists and engineers is crucial for successful machine learning deployment. Effective collaboration and communication between these teams can help overcome the technical and organizational barriers that impede the transition from development to production.\n\nDeploying ML models also involves addressing challenges such as scalability, integration with existing systems, and ongoing monitoring and maintenance. Organizations need to invest in the right tools, foster a data-driven culture, and develop robust infrastructure to support the deployment process.\n\nContinuous learning and iteration are essential for maintaining model performance post-deployment. Setting up continuous integration systems allows for seamless updates and testing of new models without disrupting operations, ensuring long-term success.\n\nComprehensive planning is crucial for the successful deployment of machine learning models. Address key areas such as data storage, tooling, and feedback mechanisms from the outset. Careful consideration of these factors helps ensure a smooth transition from development to production.\n\nSelecting the right frameworks and tools is essential for compatibility and efficiency in production environments. Choose tools that align with your target platforms and have strong community support. Popular options include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.\n\nCross-functional collaboration between data scientists, software engineers, and DevOps teams is vital. Fostering open communication and knowledge sharing helps bridge gaps and reduces delays. Applying Agile and DevOps principles creates efficient workflows and improves deployment outcomes.\n\nEstablishing a continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline streamlines the deployment process. Automating testing, validation, and deployment steps ensures consistency and enables rapid iterations. Tools like Jenkins and GitLab can help you build robust CI/CD pipelines for your machine learning projects.\n\nMonitoring and maintenance are ongoing tasks after deploying ML models. Set up systems to track model performance, detect anomalies, and gather user feedback. Regular updates and retraining help maintain model accuracy and relevance. Containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes simplify scalability and management.\n\nMachine learning deployment involves various strategies to suit application needs. Batch deployment is ideal for non-time-sensitive predictions, while real-time deployment handles immediate requests. Streaming deployment processes continuous data flows, and edge deployment runs models on devices for low-latency predictions.\n\nContainerization using Docker and Kubernetes ensures consistent and scalable deployments across environments. Containers package models and dependencies, making them portable and reproducible. Kubernetes orchestrates containers, enabling automatic scaling and management.\n\nTo safely introduce and evaluate new models, implement patterns like shadow models and A/B testing. Shadow models run alongside production models, comparing outputs without affecting users. A/B testing directs traffic to different model versions, measuring performance metrics to determine the best model.\n\nMonitoring and feedback loops are crucial for maintaining deployed models. Continuously collect data on model inputs, outputs, and decisions to detect performance degradation or bias. Retrain models regularly with new data to adapt to changing patterns and ensure optimal performance.\n\nBy selecting the appropriate deployment strategy, leveraging containerization, and implementing safe evaluation patterns, you can effectively deploy ML models in production. Continuous monitoring and iteration will help you maintain model performance and deliver value to your applications.\n\nBest practices for maintaining models in production\n\nContinuous monitoring is crucial for detecting issues like model drift and performance degradation. Set up automated systems to track key metrics and alert you when thresholds are breached. This allows you to proactively address problems before they significantly impact your business.\n\nEstablishing feedback loops and iteration processes is essential for refining models based on real-world data. Collect user feedback, monitor predictions, and regularly update your models with new training data. This ensures your deployment remains accurate and relevant over time.\n\nAddress ethical considerations by ensuring your models do not perpetuate biases or discriminate against certain groups. Regularly audit your models for fairness and compliance with legal and ethical standards. Transparency and accountability are key in maintaining trust in your deployments.\n\nVersion control is essential for managing model iterations and rollbacks. Use tools like Git to track changes, collaborate with team members, and maintain a clear history of your model's evolution. This facilitates reproducibility and helps you quickly revert to a previous version if needed.\n\nAutomation is a critical component of successful deployment. Streamline your workflow by automating tasks like data preprocessing, model training, and deployment. This reduces manual errors, saves time, and allows you to focus on higher-level tasks like model optimization and experimentation.\n\nDeploying machine learning models to production doesn't have to be a daunting task. By understanding the challenges, planning meticulously, and following best practices, you can bridge the gap between development and deployment. Embracing collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement will help you maintain model performance and derive real value from your ML initiatives."
