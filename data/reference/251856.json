        "document": "While C-style string literals are fine to use, C-style string variables behave oddly, are hard to work with (e.g. you can’t use assignment to assign a C-style string variable a new value), and are dangerous (e.g. if you copy a larger C-style string into the space allocated for a shorter C-style string, undefined behavior will result). In modern C++, C-style string variables are best avoided.\n\nFortunately, C++ has introduced two additional string types into the language that are much easier and safer to work with: and (C++17). Unlike the types we’ve introduced previously, and aren’t fundamental types (they’re class types, which we’ll cover in the future). However, basic usage of each is straightforward and useful enough that we’ll introduce them here.\n\nThe easiest way to work with strings and string objects in C++ is via the type, which lives in the <string> header.\n\nWe can create objects of type just like other objects:\n\nJust like normal variables, you can initialize or assign values to std::string objects as you would expect:\n\nNote that strings can be composed of numeric characters as well:\n\nIn string form, numbers are treated as text, not as numbers, and thus they can not be manipulated as numbers (e.g. you can’t multiply them). C++ will not automatically convert strings to integer or floating point values or vice-versa (though there are ways to do so that we’ll cover in a future lesson).\n\nobjects can be output as expected using :\n\ncan handle strings of different lengths\n\nOne of the neatest things that can do is store strings of different lengths:\n\nIn the above example, is initialized with the string , which contains five characters (four explicit characters and a null-terminator). We then set to a larger string, and then a smaller string. has no problem handling this! You can even store really long strings in a .\n\nThis is one of the reasons that is so powerful.\n\nUsing with may yield some surprises! Consider the following example:\n\nHere’s the results from a sample run of this program:\n\nHmmm, that isn’t right! What happened? It turns out that when using to extract a string from , only returns characters up to the first whitespace it encounters. Any other characters are left inside , waiting for the next extraction.\n\nSo when we used to extract input into variable , only was extracted, leaving inside . When we then used to get extract input into variable , it extracted instead of waiting for us to input an color. Then the program ends.\n\nTo read a full line of input into a string, you’re better off using the function instead. requires two arguments: the first is , and the second is your string variable.\n\nHere’s the same program as above using :\n\nNow our program works as expected:\n\nWhat the heck is ?\n\nIn lesson 4.8 -- Floating point numbers, we discussed output manipulators, which allow us to alter the way output is displayed. In that lesson, we used the output manipulator function to change the number of digits of precision that displayed.\n\nC++ also supports input manipulators, which alter the way that input is accepted. The input manipulator tells to ignore any leading whitespace before extraction. Leading whitespace is any whitespace character (spaces, tabs, newlines) that occur at the start of the string.\n\nLet’s explore why this is useful. Consider the following program:\n\nHere’s some output from this program:\n\nThis program first asks you to enter 1 or 2, and waits for you to do so. All good so far. Then it will ask you to enter your name. However, it won’t actually wait for you to enter your name! Instead, it prints the “Hello” string, and then exits.\n\nWhen you enter a value using , not only captures the value, it also captures the newline character ( ) that occurs when you hit the enter key. So when we type and then hit enter, captures the string as input. It then extracts the value to variable , leaving the newline character behind for later. Then, when goes to extract text to , it sees is already waiting in , and figures we must have previously entered an empty string! Definitely not what was intended.\n\nWe can amend the above program to use the input manipulator, to tell to ignore any leading whitespace characters:\n\nNow this program will function as intended.\n\nIf we want to know how many characters are in a , we can ask a object for its length. The syntax for doing this is different than you’ve seen before, but is pretty straightforward:\n\nAlthough is required to be null-terminated (as of C++11), the returned length of a does not include the implicit null-terminator character.\n\nNote that instead of asking for the string length as , we say . The function isn’t a normal standalone function -- it’s a special type of function that is nested within called a member function. Because the member function is declared inside of , it is sometimes written as in documentation.\n\nWe’ll cover member functions, including how to write your own, in more detail later.\n\nAlso note that returns an unsigned integral value (most likely of type ). If you want to assign the length to an variable, you should it to avoid compiler warnings about signed/unsigned conversions:\n\nWhenever a std::string is initialized, a copy of the string used to initialize it is made. Making copies of strings is expensive, so care should be taken to minimize the number of copies made.\n\nDo not pass by value\n\nWhen a is passed to a function by value, the function parameter must be instantiated and initialized with the argument. This results in an expensive copy. We’ll discuss what to do instead (use ) in lesson 5.8 -- Introduction to std::string_view.\n\nWhen a function returns by value to the caller, the return value is normally copied from the function back to the caller. So you might expect that you should not return by value, as doing so would return an expensive copy of a .\n\nHowever, as a rule of thumb, it is okay to return a by value when the expression of the return statement resolves to any of the following:\n• A that has been returned by value from another function call or operator.\n• A temporary that is created as part of the return statement.\n\nIn most other cases, prefer to avoid returning a by value, as doing so will make an expensive copy.\n\nDouble-quoted string literals (like “Hello, world!”) are C-style strings by default (and thus, have a strange type).\n\nWe can create string literals with type by using a suffix after the double-quoted string literal. The must be lower case.\n\nYou probably won’t need to use literals very often (as it’s fine to initialize a object with a C-style string literal), but we’ll see a few cases in future lessons (involving type deduction) where using literals instead of C-style string literals makes things easier (see 10.8 -- Type deduction for objects using the auto keyword for an example).\n\nIf you try to define a , your compiler will probably generate an error:\n\nThis happens because isn’t supported at all in C++17 or earlier, and only works in very limited cases in C++20/23. If you need constexpr strings, use instead (discussed in lesson 5.8 -- Introduction to std::string_view).\n\nis complex, leveraging many language features that we haven’t covered yet. Fortunately, you don’t need to understand these complexities to use for simple tasks, like basic string input and output. We encourage you to start experimenting with strings now, and we’ll cover additional string capabilities later.\n\nWrite a program that asks the user to enter their full name and their age. As output, tell the user the sum of their age and the number of characters in their name (use the member function to get the length of the string). For simplicity, count any spaces in the name as a character.\n\nReminder: We need to be careful not to mix signed and unsigned values. returns an unsigned value. If you’re C++20 capable, use to get the length as a signed value. Otherwise, static_cast the return value of to an int."

        "document": "Strings are essential components in any programming language, and C++ is no exception.\n\nWhether you want to store text, manipulate it, or accept keyboard inputs and outputs, understanding what strings are and how to effectively use them is extremely important.\n\nThis article will teach everything you need to know about handling and working with strings in C++.\n\nStrings, at their core, are essentially collections of characters. Some examples include \"Hello World\", \"My name is Jason\", and so on. They're enclosed in double quotes .\n\nIn C++, we have two types of strings:\n• s (from the C++ Standard string class)\n\nYou can very easily create your own string class with their own little functions, but it's not something we're going to get into in this article.\n\nThese are strings derived from the C programming language and they continue to be supported in C++. These \"collections of characters\" are stored in the form of arrays of type that are null-terminated (the null character).\n\nHere, is a array of length (the extra character comes from the null character that's added by the compiler).\n\nHere are some other ways of defining C-style strings in C++:\n\nHow to pass C-style strings to a function\n\nHow to use C-style string functions in C++\n\nThe C Standard Library came with a couple of handy functions that you can use to manipulate strings. While they're not widely recommended to use (see below), you can still use them in C++ code by including the header:\n\nC-style strings are relatively unsafe – if the string/char array is not null-terminated, it can lead to a whole host of potential bugs.\n\nFor example, buffer overflows among a whole host of other drawbacks are some reasons why the use of C-style strings are not recommended in the C++ developer community.\n\nThe class that's provided by the C++ Standard Library is a much safer alternative. Here's how you use it:\n\nThe most obvious difference to note between C-style strings and s is the length of the string. If you ever need the length of a C-style string, you'll need to compute it each time using the function like so:\n\nIf you don't store this in a variable and require it in multiple parts of your program, you can quickly observe how expensive this option is.\n\nOn the other hand, a string already has an in-built length property. To access it, you use the property as follows:\n\nBut accessing the length property isn't the only benefit to using s. Here are a few more examples:\n\nHow to pass an to a function\n\nWhen would you use a C-style string over ?\n\nBy now, you should be convinced of the numerous advantages that s have over C-style strings (most notably automatic memory management). But there are times when you'd want to use C-style strings instead:\n• If you're from a C background, you might be comfortable working with C-style strings.\n• A , despite its benefits, is enormously complex. Like the rest of the language, if you don't know what you're doing, it can get real complicated very quickly. Plus, it uses a ton of memory that may not be ideal for the purposes of your programs.\n• If you're careful to manage your program's memory during runtime (by freeing an object's memory when you're done using it), there is a performance benefit to using C-style strings considering how small and lightweight they are.\n\nI hope this article served as an introduction to strings in C++. There's so much more to learn about this wonderful abstraction, and I hope to write more articles delving into the more advanced concepts of strings and C++.\n\nBe sure to follow me on Twitter for updates on my C++ learning journey.

They are also used to store data, such as numbers and other types of information in the form of text. Strings are provided by <string> header file in the form of std::string class.\n\nCreating a string means creating an instance of std::string class as shown:\n\nwhere str_name is the name of the string.\n\nInitializing means assigning some initial value to the string. This can be done by using assignment operator and the text enclosed inside “” double quotes.\n\nThe text inside “” is called string literal and it is the value that is assigned to the string variables. It doesn’t need to have any meaning. It can be any text that is the sequence of characters from the ASCII charset.\n\nA string can be referred using its name anywhere in the scope once it is declared. For example, the below example prints string using cout:\n\nThe individual characters of the strings can also be accessed using their position (or index) like arrays with [] square brackets. The index in C++ starts from 0 and goes till size – 1, so be careful not go outside this limit.\n\nThe string variable can be updated store a new string literal in a similar way it is initialized.\n\nA single character can also be changed by first accessing the character and then using assignment operator to assign value.\n\nThe following operations aims to improve your understanding of the strings in C++ and introduce you to some of the most commonly used operations provided by C++:\n\nThe string can be passed to a function in the same was as any other type of variable.\n\nC++ is a superset of C language, so it also inherits the way in which we used to create strings in C. In C, strings were nothing, but an array of characters terminated by a NULL character ‘\\0’. They were created as:\n\nDue to being array, there were limitations on C strings:\n• Fixed Size : Once declared, the size of the C string cannot be changed.\n• Lack of Easy String Operations: No high-level operations like concatenation or substring extraction. Moreover, updating was also complex.\n\nC++ strings resolve this issue by providing a lot of operations that are easy to perform. Internally, these strings are still implemented as dynamic array of characters (or more precisely vectors) Thats why we can access a single character by its index. But the std::string class act as a wrapper and provides lot of built-in functionality for easier and more efficient handling of strings.\n\nC++ String vs C Strings\n\nThe main difference between a string and a character array is that strings are immutable, while character arrays are not.\n\nKnow more about the difference between strings and character arrays in C++\n\nC++ provides some inbuilt functions which are used for string manipulation, such as the strcpy() and strcat() functions for copying and concatenating strings. Some of them are:\n\nThis function returns the length of the string. This function is used to swap the values of 2 strings. Used to find the size of string This function is used to resize the length of the string up to the given number of characters. Used to find the string which is passed in parameters This function is used to push the passed character at the end of the string This function is used to pop the last character from the string This function is used to remove all the elements of the string. This function compares at most the first num bytes of both passed strings. This function is similar to strcpy() function, except that at most n bytes of src are copied This function locates the last occurrence of a character in the string. This function appends a copy of the source string to the end of the destination string This function is used to search for a certain substring inside a string and returns the position of the first character of the substring. This function is used to replace each element in the range [first, last) that is equal to old value with new value. This function is used to create a substring from a given string. This function is used to compare two strings and returns the result in the form of an integer. This function is used to remove a certain part of a string. This function is used to find the string’s last occurrence.\n\nThese functions are discussed in this article in more detail – String Function in C++"

C++ includes the std::string class that is used to represent strings. It is one of the most fundamental datatypes in C++ and it comes with a huge set of inbuilt functions. In this article, will look at the functions of string computations.\n\nCommonly Used String Functions in C++\n\nThe std::string class contains functions to provide some common string operations. The below table contains some of the most commonly used functions in C++:\n\nWe can find the length of the string (number of characters) using either length() or size() function of the std::string class.\n• This function does not take any parameter.\n• This function returns the number of characters in the string object.\n\nIt will return the length of the string text which is 13.\n\nGenerally, we can access the character of a string using the [] array subscript operator and indexing. But std::string also has a function named at() which can be used to access the characters of the string.\n• index: It represents the position of the character in the string.\n• This function returns the character present at the index.\n\nThe std::cout will print K on the console as it is the character present at index 3.\n\nWe can concatenate string in C++ using two methods:\n\nThe + operator is overloaded in the std::string class to perform string concatenation.\n\n+ operator is used to concatenate two strings. The string fullName will be \"GeeksforGeeks\".\n\nThe append() function is another member function to concatenate two strings.\n• string2: This function takes the string to be appended as a parameter. It can be both C or C++ Style string.\n\nThe append() function adds one string to the end of another.\n\nJust like the concatenation, we can do the string comparison using two methods:\n\nThe equality operator can be used to compare the two strings as it is overloaded for this operation in the std::string class.\n\nThis will return true if both the strings are equal, otherwise returns false.\n\nHere, \"Strings are not equal\" will be printed as the == operator will return false.\n\nThe compare() function is a member function of std::string class which can be used to compare two strings.\n• str2: It is the string to be compared. It can be both C or C++ style string.\n• If the strings are equal, return zero.\n• If str1 is greater than str2, return value >0\n• If str2 is greater than str1, return value <0\n\nThe result will contain a value less than zero as str2 is greater than str1.\n\nWe can also compare the substring of str2 using the compare function():\n• position: position of the first character substring.\n\nWe can use the find() function of the std::string class to check whether a given character or a substring is present in the string or a part of string.\n• var: It can be a C style string, C++ style string, or a character that is to be searched in the string.\n• It returns the pointer to the first occurrence of the character or a substring in the string.\n\nThe position variable will contain 4 which is the start of the first occurrence of the string \"Programming\" in string text.\n\nWe can use the substr() function to generate a part of the string as a new string object. It is a member function of the std::string class.\n\nSyntax of substr() in C\n• start: Starting position of the substring to be generated.\n• end: Ending of the substring to be generated.\n\nIn the above example. the sub string will contain the \"World\".\n\nThe following function allows us to modify the current string.\n\nThe insert() function not only allows us to add a string but also allows us to add it at the specified position. It is also a member function of the std::string class.\n• index: position of where to insert the new string\n\nThe replace() function replaces the part of the string with the given other string. Unlike insert, the characters in the part where the new string is to be inserted are removed.\n• index: Index of where to start replacing the new string.\n• size: length of the part of the string that is to be replaced.\n• str2: new string that is to be inserted.\n\nThe erase() function is a member function of std::string class that is used to remove a character or a part of the string.\n\nThe c_str() function is a member function that is used to convert the C++ style string i.e. std::string objects to C style string i.e. array of characters.\n• This function does not take any parameter.\n• Pointer to the equivalent array of characters.\n\nExample of String Functions in C++\n\nThe below code demonstrate the use of the above specified string functions:"
