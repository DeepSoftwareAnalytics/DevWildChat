        "document": "The cmake executable is the command-line interface of the cross-platform buildsystem generator CMake. The above Synopsis lists various actions the tool can perform as described in sections below. To build a software project with CMake, Generate a Project Buildsystem. Optionally use cmake to Build a Project, Install a Project or just run the corresponding build tool (e.g. ) directly. cmake can also be used to View Help. The other actions are meant for use by software developers writing scripts in the to support their builds. For graphical user interfaces that may be used in place of cmake, see and . For command-line interfaces to the CMake testing and packaging facilities, see and . For more information on CMake at large, see also the links at the end of this manual.\n\nA buildsystem describes how to build a project's executables and libraries from its source code using a build tool to automate the process. For example, a buildsystem may be a for use with a command-line tool or a project file for an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). In order to avoid maintaining multiple such buildsystems, a project may specify its buildsystem abstractly using files written in the . From these files CMake generates a preferred buildsystem locally for each user through a backend called a generator. To generate a buildsystem with CMake, the following must be selected: The top-level directory containing source files provided by the project. The project specifies its buildsystem using files as described in the manual, starting with a top-level file named . These files specify build targets and their dependencies as described in the manual. The top-level directory in which buildsystem files and build output artifacts (e.g. executables and libraries) are to be stored. CMake will write a file to identify the directory as a build tree and store persistent information such as buildsystem configuration options. To maintain a pristine source tree, perform an out-of-source build by using a separate dedicated build tree. An in-source build in which the build tree is placed in the same directory as the source tree is also supported, but discouraged. This chooses the kind of buildsystem to generate. See the manual for documentation of all generators. Run to see a list of generators available locally. Optionally use the option below to specify a generator, or simply accept the default CMake chooses for the current platform. When using one of the Command-Line Build Tool Generators CMake expects that the environment needed by the compiler toolchain is already configured in the shell. When using one of the IDE Build Tool Generators, no particular environment is needed.\n\nRun CMake with one of the following command signatures to specify the source and build trees and generate a buildsystem: Uses as the build tree and as the source tree. The specified paths may be absolute or relative to the current working directory. The source tree must contain a file. The build tree will be created automatically if it does not already exist. For example: Uses the current working directory as the build tree, and as the source tree. The specified path may be absolute or relative to the current working directory. The source tree must contain a file and must not contain a file because the latter identifies an existing build tree. For example: Uses as the build tree, and loads the path to the source tree from its file, which must have already been generated by a previous run of CMake. The specified path may be absolute or relative to the current working directory. For example: In all cases the may be zero or more of the Options below. The above styles for specifying the source and build trees may be mixed. Paths specified with or are always classified as source or build trees, respectively. Paths specified with plain arguments are classified based on their content and the types of paths given earlier. If only one type of path is given, the current working directory (cwd) is used for the other. For example: Changed in version 3.23: CMake warns when multiple source paths are specified. This has never been officially documented or supported, but older versions accidentally accepted multiple source paths and used the last path specified. Avoid passing multiple source path arguments. After generating a buildsystem one may use the corresponding native build tool to build the project. For example, after using the generator one may run directly: Alternatively, one may use cmake to Build a Project by automatically choosing and invoking the appropriate native build tool. Path to root directory of the CMake project to build. Path to directory which CMake will use as the root of build directory. If the directory doesn't already exist CMake will make it. When CMake is first run in an empty build tree, it creates a file and populates it with customizable settings for the project. This option may be used to specify a file from which to load cache entries before the first pass through the project's CMake listfiles. The loaded entries take priority over the project's default values. The given file should be a CMake script containing commands that use the option, not a cache-format file. References to and within the script evaluate to the top-level source and build tree. When CMake is first run in an empty build tree, it creates a file and populates it with customizable settings for the project. This option may be used to specify a setting that takes priority over the project's default value. The option may be repeated for as many entries as desired. If the portion is given it must be one of the types specified by the command documentation for its signature. If the portion is omitted the entry will be created with no type if it does not exist with a type already. If a command in the project sets the type to or then the will be converted to an absolute path. This option may also be given as a single argument: or . It's important to note that the order of and arguments is significant. They will be carried out in the order they are listed, with the last argument taking precedence over the previous ones. For example, if you specify , followed by a argument with a file that calls: then the argument will take precedence, and will be set to . However, if the argument comes after the argument, it will be set to . If a call in the file does not use , and a argument sets the same variable, the argument will take precedence regardless of order because of the nature of non- calls. This option may be used to remove one or more variables from the file, globbing expressions using and are supported. The option may be repeated for as many entries as desired. Use with care, you can make your non-working. CMake may support multiple native build systems on certain platforms. A generator is responsible for generating a particular build system. Possible generator names are specified in the manual. If not specified, CMake checks the environment variable and otherwise falls back to a builtin default selection. Toolset specification for the generator, if supported. Some CMake generators support a toolset specification to tell the native build system how to choose a compiler. See the variable for details. Specify platform name if supported by generator. Some CMake generators support a platform name to be given to the native build system to choose a compiler or SDK. See the variable for details. Specify the cross compiling toolchain file, equivalent to setting variable. Relative paths are interpreted as relative to the build directory, and if not found, relative to the source directory. Specify the installation directory, used by the variable. Must be an absolute path. Specify an alternate project file name. This determines the top-level file processed by CMake when configuring a project, and the file processed by . By default, this is . If set to anything else, will be used as a fallback whenever the specified file cannot be found within a project subdirectory. This feature is intended for temporary use by developers during an incremental transition and not for publication of a final product. CMake will always emit a warning when the project file is anything other than . Suppress warnings that are meant for the author of the files. By default this will also turn off deprecation warnings. Enable warnings that are meant for the author of the files. By default this will also turn on deprecation warnings. Enable warnings for usage of deprecated functionality, that are meant for the author of the files. Suppress warnings for usage of deprecated functionality, that are meant for the author of the files. Treat CMake warnings as errors. must be one of the following: Make warnings that are meant for the author of the files errors. By default this will also turn on deprecated warnings as errors. Make warnings for usage of deprecated macros and functions, that are meant for the author of the files, errors. Do not treat CMake warnings as errors. must be one of the following: Make warnings that are meant for the author of the files not errors. By default this will also turn off deprecated warnings as errors. Make warnings for usage of deprecated macros and functions, that are meant for the author of the files, not errors. Perform a fresh configuration of the build tree. This removes any existing file and associated directory, and recreates them from scratch. Changed in version 3.30: For dependencies previously populated by with the setting for policy , their stamp and script files from any previous run will be removed. The download, update, and patch steps will therefore be forced to re-execute. List variables will run CMake and list all the variables from the CMake that are not marked as or . This will effectively display current CMake settings, which can then be changed with option. Changing some of the variables may result in more variables being created. If is specified, then it will display also advanced variables. If is specified, it will also display help for each variable. Show non- nor variables from the CMake that match the given regex. If is specified, then it will also show advanced variables. If is specified, it will also display help for each variable. Only load the cache. Do not actually run configure and generate steps. Generate graphviz of dependencies, see for more. Generate a graphviz input file that will contain all the library and executable dependencies in the project. See the documentation for for more details. Dump a wide range of information about the current system. If run from the top of a binary tree for a CMake project it will dump additional information such as the cache, log files etc. See for more details. The command will only output messages of the specified log level or higher. The valid log levels are , , , (default), , , or . To make a log level persist between CMake runs, set as a cache variable instead. If both the command line option and the variable are given, the command line option takes precedence. For backward compatibility reasons, is also accepted as a synonym for this option. Added in version 3.25: See the command for a way to query the current message logging level. Enable the command outputting context attached to each message. This option turns on showing context for the current CMake run only. To make showing the context persistent for all subsequent CMake runs, set as a cache variable instead. When this command line option is given, is ignored. Enable logging of diagnostic messages produced by CMake in the SARIF format. Write diagnostic messages to a SARIF file at the path specified. Projects can also set to to enable this feature for a build tree. Do not delete the files and directories created for / calls. This is useful in debugging failed checks. Note that some uses of may use the same build tree, which will limit the usefulness of this option if a project executes more than one . For example, such uses may change results as artifacts from a previous try-compile may cause a different test to either pass or fail incorrectly. This option is best used only when debugging. Added in version 3.25: When this option is enabled, every try-compile check prints a log message reporting the directory in which the check is performed. Print extra information during the cmake run like stack traces with calls. Print extra find call information during the cmake run to standard error. Output is designed for human consumption and not for parsing. See also the variable for debugging a more local part of the project. Put cmake find commands in a debug mode when running under calls to , where is an entry in the given comma-separated list of case-sensitive package names. Like , but limiting scope to the specified packages. Put cmake find commands in a debug mode when called with as the result variable, where is an entry in the given comma-separated list. Like , but limiting scope to the specified variable names. Print a trace of all calls made and from where. Like , but with variables expanded. Put cmake in trace mode and sets the trace output format. can be one of the following values. Prints each trace line in a human-readable format. This is the default format. Prints each line as a separate JSON document. Each document is separated by a newline ( ). It is guaranteed that no newline characters will be present inside a JSON document. The full path to the CMake source file where the function was called. The line in where the function call begins. If the function call spans multiple lines, this field will be set to the line where the function call ends. If the function calls spans a single line, this field will be unset. This field was added in minor version 2 of the format. Optional member that is present when the function call was deferred by . If present, its value is a string containing the deferred call . The name of the function that was called. Timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the function call. Stack frame depth of the function that was called, within the context of the being processed currently. Stack frame depth of the function that was called, tracked globally across all files involved in the trace. This field was added in minor version 2 of the format. Additionally, the first JSON document outputted contains the key for the current major and minor version of the Indicates the version of the JSON format. The version has a major and minor components following semantic version conventions. Put cmake in trace mode, but output only lines of a specified file. Put cmake in trace mode and redirect trace output to a file instead of stderr. Print a warning when an uninitialized variable is used. Does nothing. In CMake versions 3.2 and below this enabled warnings about unused variables. In CMake versions 3.3 through 3.18 the option was broken. In CMake 3.19 and above the option has been removed. Don't find variables that are declared on the command line, but not used. Normally, unused and uninitialized variables are searched for only in and . This flag tells CMake to warn about other files as well. Ignore target property and variable , preventing warnings from being treated as errors on compile. Ignore target property and variable , preventing warnings from being treated as errors on link. Used in conjunction with to output to a given path. Enable the output of profiling data of CMake script in the given format. This can aid performance analysis of CMake scripts executed. Third party applications should be used to process the output into human readable format. Currently supported values are: Outputs in Google Trace Format, which can be parsed by the about:tracing tab of Google Chrome or using a plugin for a tool like Trace Compass. Reads a from and files, which must be located in the same directory as the top level file. The preset may specify the generator, the build directory, a list of variables, and other arguments to pass to CMake. At least one of or must be present. The also recognizes and supports and files. For full details on these files, see . The presets are read before all other command line options, although the option can be used to specify the source directory containing the and files. If is not given, the current directory is assumed to be the top level source directory and must contain the presets files. The options specified by the chosen preset (variables, generator, etc.) can all be overridden by manually specifying them on the command line. For example, if the preset sets a variable called to , but the user sets it to with a argument, the value is preferred. Lists the available presets of the specified . Valid values for are , , , , or . If is omitted, is assumed. The current working directory must contain CMake preset files unless the option is used to specify a different top level source directory. Enables interactive debugging of the CMake language. CMake exposes a debugging interface on the pipe named by that conforms to the Debug Adapter Protocol specification with the following modifications. The response includes an additional field named which specifies the version of CMake being debugged. An integer specifying the major version number. An integer specifying the minor version number. An integer specifying the patch version number. Name of the pipe (on Windows) or domain socket (on Unix) to use for debugger communication. Logs all debugger communication to the specified file.\n\nCMake provides builtin command-line tools through the signature Run or for a summary of commands. Report cmake capabilities in JSON format. The output is a JSON object with the following keys: The full version string as displayed by cmake . A bool that is set if the cmake build is from a dirty tree. A list available generators. Each generator is a JSON object with the following keys: A string containing the name of the generator. if the generator supports toolsets and otherwise. if the generator supports platforms and otherwise. Optional member that may be present when the generator supports platform specification via ( ). The value is a list of platforms known to be supported. A list of strings with all the Extra Generators compatible with the generator. Optional member that is present when the is available. The value is a JSON object with one member: A JSON array containing zero or more supported file-api requests. Each request is a JSON object with members: Specifies one of the supported Object Kinds. A JSON array whose elements are each a JSON object containing and members specifying non-negative integer version components. if cmake supports server-mode and otherwise. Always false since CMake 3.20. if TLS support is enabled and otherwise. if the mode is supported and otherwise. Concatenate files and print on the standard output. Added support for the double dash argument . This basic implementation of does not support any options, so using a option starting with will result in an error. Use to indicate the end of options, in case a file starts with . Added in version 3.29: can now print the standard input by passing the argument. Check if is same as . If files are the same, then returns , if not it returns . In case of invalid arguments, it returns 2. Copy files to (either file or directory). If multiple files are specified, or if is specified, the must be directory and it must exist. If is not specified, the last argument is assumed to be the . Wildcards are not supported. does follow symlinks. That means it does not copy symlinks, but the files or directories it point to. Copy content of directories to directory. If directory does not exist it will be created. does follow symlinks. Added in version 3.15: The command now fails when the source directory does not exist. Previously it succeeded by creating an empty destination directory. Copy changed content of directories to directory. If directory does not exist it will be created. does follow symlinks. The command fails when the source directory does not exist. Copy files to (either file or directory) if they have changed. If multiple files are specified, the must be directory and it must exist. does follow symlinks. Added in version 3.13: Support for creating symlinks on Windows. Path to where symbolic link will be created has to exist beforehand. Path to where hard link will be created has to exist beforehand. has to exist beforehand. Displays arguments as text but no new line. Replaces the current value of with . Unsets the current value of . The and options are equivalent to and , respectively. Note that resets to the value it had when cmake launched (or unsets it), not to the most recent option. Added support for the double dash argument . Use to stop interpreting options/environment variables and treat the next argument as the command, even if it start with or contains a . Do nothing, with an exit code of 1. Create directories. If necessary, create parent directories too. If a directory already exists it will be silently ignored. Remove the file(s). The planned behavior was that if any of the listed files already do not exist, the command returns a non-zero exit code, but no message is logged. The option changes the behavior to return a zero exit code (i.e. success) in such situations instead. does not follow symlinks. That means it remove only symlinks and not files it point to. The implementation was buggy and always returned 0. It cannot be fixed without breaking backwards compatibility. Use instead. Remove directories and their contents. If a directory does not exist it will be silently ignored. Use instead. Added in version 3.16: If is a symlink to a directory, just the symlink will be removed. Rename a file or directory (on one volume). If file with the name already exists, then it will be silently replaced. Remove the files or directories . Use or to remove directories and their contents recursively. If any of the listed files/directories do not exist, the command returns a non-zero exit code, but no message is logged. The option changes the behavior to return a zero exit code (i.e. success) in such situations instead. Use to stop interpreting options and treat all remaining arguments as paths, even if they start with . Sleep for seconds. may be a floating point number. A practical minimum is about 0.1 seconds due to overhead in starting/stopping CMake executable. This can be useful in a CMake script to insert a delay: Create or extract a tar or zip archive. Options are: Create a new archive containing the specified files. If used, the argument is mandatory. Extract to disk from the archive. Added in version 3.15: The argument could be used to extract only selected files or directories. When extracting selected files or directories, you must provide their exact names including the path, as printed by list ( ). Added in version 3.15: The argument could be used to list only selected files or directories. Read file names from the given file, one per line. Blank lines are ignored. Lines may not start in except for to add files whose names start in . Specify the format of the archive to be created. Supported formats are: , , , (restricted pax, default), and . Use current local timestamp instead of extracting file timestamps from the archive. Stop interpreting options and treat all remaining arguments as file names, even if they start with . Added in version 3.15: The command now continues adding files to an archive even if some of the files are not readable. This behavior is more consistent with the classic tool. The command now also parses all flags, and if an invalid flag was provided, a warning is issued. Added in version 3.5: The command now properly passes arguments with spaces or special characters through to the child process. This may break scripts that worked around the bug with their own extra quoting or escaping. Creates if file do not exist. If exists, it is changing access and modification times. Touch a file if it exists but do not create it. If a file does not exist it will be silently ignored. Do nothing, with an exit code of 0.\n\nTo print selected pages from the CMake documentation, use with one of the following options: Show program name/version banner and exit.

        "document": "Where a software package supplies a CMake-based buildsystem with the source of their software, the consumer of the software is required to run a CMake user interaction tool in order to build it. Well-behaved CMake-based buildsystems do not create any output in the source directory, so typically, the user performs an out-of-source build and performs the build there. First, CMake must be instructed to generate a suitable buildsystem, then the user invokes a build tool to process that generated buildsystem. The generated buildsystem is specific to the machine used to generate it and is not redistributable. Each consumer of a provided source software package is required to use CMake to generate a buildsystem specific to their system. Generated buildsystems should generally be treated as read-only. The CMake files as a primary artifact should completely specify the buildsystem and there should be no reason to populate properties manually in an IDE for example after generating the buildsystem. CMake will periodically rewrite the generated buildsystem, so modifications by users will be overwritten. The features and user interfaces described in this manual are available for all CMake-based build systems by virtue of providing CMake files. The CMake tooling may report errors to the user when processing provided CMake files, such as reporting that the compiler is not supported, or the compiler does not support a required compile option, or a dependency can not be found. These errors must be resolved by the user by choosing a different compiler, , or instructing CMake where to find them, etc. A simple but typical use of with a fresh copy of software source code is to create a build directory and invoke cmake there: It is recommended to build in a separate directory to the source because that keeps the source directory pristine, allows for building a single source with multiple toolchains, and allows easy clearing of build artifacts by simply deleting the build directory. The CMake tooling may report warnings which are intended for the provider of the software, not intended for the consumer of the software. Such warnings end with \"This warning is for project developers\". Users may disable such warnings by passing the flag to . Users more accustomed to GUI interfaces may use the tool to invoke CMake and generate a buildsystem. The source and binary directories must first be populated. It is always advised to use different directories for the source and the build.\n\nThere are several user interface tools which may be used to generate a buildsystem from CMake files. The and tools guide the user through setting the various necessary options. The tool can be invoked to specify options on the command line. This manual describes options which may be set using any of the user interface tools, though the mode of setting an option is different for each tool. When invoking with a command line buildsystem such as or , it is necessary to use the correct build environment to ensure that build tools are available. CMake must be able to find the appropriate , compiler, linker and other tools as needed. On Linux systems, the appropriate tools are often provided in system-wide locations and may be readily installed through the system package manager. Other toolchains provided by the user or installed in non-default locations can also be used. When cross-compiling, some platforms may require environment variables to be set or may provide scripts to set the environment. Visual Studio ships multiple command prompts and scripts for setting up the correct environments for command line buildsystems. While not strictly necessary to use a corresponding command line environment when using a Visual Studio generator, doing so has no disadvantages. When using Xcode, there can be more than one Xcode version installed. Which one to use can be selected in a number of different ways, but the most common methods are:\n• None Setting the default version in the preferences of the Xcode IDE.\n• None Setting the default version via the command line tool.\n• None Overriding the default version by setting the environment variable when running CMake and the build tool. For convenience, provides an environment variable editor. CMake chooses a generator by default based on the platform. Usually, the default generator is sufficient to allow the user to proceed to build the software. The user may override the default generator with the option: The output of includes a list of available for the user to choose from. Note that generator names are case sensitive. On Unix-like systems (including Mac OS X), the generator is used by default. A variant of that generator can also be used on Windows in various environments, such as the and generator. These generators generate a variant which can be executed with , , or similar tools. See the individual generator documentation for more information on targeted environments and tools. The generator is available on all major platforms. is a build tool similar in use-cases to , but with a focus on performance and efficiency. On Windows, can be used to generate solutions for the Visual Studio IDE. Visual Studio versions may be specified by the product name of the IDE, which includes a four-digit year. Aliases are provided for other means by which Visual Studio versions are sometimes referred to, such as two digits which correspond to the product version of the VisualC++ compiler, or a combination of the two: Visual Studio generators can target different architectures. One can specify the target architecture using the option: On Apple, the generator may be used to generate project files for the Xcode IDE. Some IDEs such as KDevelop4, QtCreator and CLion have native support for CMake-based buildsystems. Those IDEs provide user interface for selecting an underlying generator to use, typically a choice between a or a based generator. Note that it is not possible to change the generator with after the first invocation of CMake. To change the generator, the build directory must be deleted and the build must be started from scratch. When generating Visual Studio project and solutions files several other options are available to use when initially running . The Visual Studio toolset can be specified with the option: Whereas the option specifies the _target_ architecture, the option can be used to specify details of the toolchain used. For example, can be given to select the 64-bit version of the host tools. The following demonstrates how to use 64-bit tools and also build for a 64-bit target architecture: The \"Configure\" button triggers a new dialog to select the CMake generator to use. All generators available on the command line are also available in . When choosing a Visual Studio generator, further options are available to set an architecture to generate for.\n\nSoftware projects often require variables to be set on the command line when invoking CMake. Some of the most commonly used CMake variables are listed in the table below: Build configuration, such as or , determining debug/optimization flags. This is only relevant for single-configuration buildsystems such as and . Multi-configuration buildsystems such as those for Visual Studio and Xcode ignore this setting. Location to install the software to with the build target File containing cross-compiling data such as . Whether to build shared instead of static libraries for commands used without a type Generate a file for use with clang-based tools Generate a file for use with clang-based tools Other project-specific variables may be available to control builds, such as enabling or disabling components of the project. There is no convention provided by CMake for how such variables are named between different provided buildsystems, except that variables with the prefix usually refer to options provided by CMake itself and should not be used in third-party options, which should use their own prefix instead. The tool can display options in groups defined by their prefix, so it makes sense for third parties to ensure that they use a self-consistent prefix. CMake variables can be set on the command line either when creating the initial build: or later on a subsequent invocation of : The flag may be used to unset variables on the command line: A CMake buildsystem which was initially created on the command line can be modified using the and vice-versa. The tool allows specifying a file to use to populate the initial cache using the option. This can be useful to simplify commands and scripts which repeatedly require the same cache entries. Variables may be set in the cmake-gui using the \"Add Entry\" button. This triggers a new dialog to set the value of the variable. The main view of the user interface can be used to edit existing variables. When CMake is executed, it needs to find the locations of compilers, tools and dependencies. It also needs to be able to consistently re-generate a buildsystem to use the same compile/link flags and paths to dependencies. Such parameters are also required to be configurable by the user because they are paths and options specific to the users system. When it is first executed, CMake generates a file in the build directory containing key-value pairs for such artifacts. The cache file can be viewed or edited by the user by running the or tool. The tools provide an interactive interface for re-configuring the provided software and re-generating the buildsystem, as is needed after editing cached values. Each cache entry may have an associated short help text which is displayed in the user interface tools. The cache entries may also have a type to signify how it should be presented in the user interface. For example, a cache entry of type can be edited by a checkbox in a user interface, a can be edited in a text field, and a while similar to a should also provide a way to locate filesystem paths using a file dialog. An entry of type may provide a restricted list of allowed values which are then provided in a drop-down menu in the user interface (see the cache property). The CMake files shipped with a software package may also define boolean toggle options using the command. The command creates a cache entry which has a help text and a default value. Such cache entries are typically specific to the provided software and affect the configuration of the build, such as whether tests and examples are built, whether to build with exceptions enabled etc.\n\nCMake understands a file, , and its user-specific counterpart, , for saving presets for commonly-used configure settings. These presets can set the build directory, generator, cache variables, environment variables, and other command-line options. All of these options can be overridden by the user. The full details of the format are listed in the manual. Using presets on the command-line¶ When using the command line tool, a preset can be invoked by using the option. If is specified, the generator and build directory are not required, but can be specified to override them. For example, if you have the following file: and you run the following: This will generate a build directory in with the generator, and with set to . If you want to see the list of available presets, you can run: This will list the presets available in and without generating a build tree. If a project has presets available, either through or , the list of presets will appear in a drop-down menu in between the source directory and the binary directory. Choosing a preset sets the binary directory, generator, environment variables, and cache variables, but all of these options can be overridden after a preset is selected.\n\nAfter generating the buildsystem, the software can be built by invoking the particular build tool. In the case of the IDE generators, this can involve loading the generated project file into the IDE to invoke the build. CMake is aware of the specific build tool needed to invoke a build so in general, to build a buildsystem or project from the command line after generating, the following command may be invoked in the build directory: The flag enables a particular mode of operation for the tool. It invokes the command associated with the , or the build tool configured by the user. The mode also accepts the parameter to specify a particular target to build, for example a particular library, executable or custom target, or a particular special target like : The mode also accepts a parameter in the case of multi-config generators to specify which particular configuration to build: The option has no effect if the generator generates a buildsystem specific to a configuration which is chosen when invoking cmake with the variable. Some buildsystems omit details of command lines invoked during the build. The flag can be used to cause those command lines to be shown: The mode can also pass particular command line options to the underlying build tool by listing them after . This can be useful to specify options to the build tool, such as to continue the build after a failed job, where CMake does not provide a high-level user interface. For all generators, it is possible to run the underlying build tool after invoking CMake. For example, may be executed after generating with the generator to invoke the build, or after generating with the generator etc. The IDE buildsystems usually provide command line tooling for building a project which can also be invoked. Each executable and library described in the CMake files is a build target, and the buildsystem may describe custom targets, either for internal use, or for user consumption, for example to create documentation. CMake provides some built-in targets for all buildsystems providing CMake files. The default target used by and generators. Builds all targets in the buildsystem, except those which are excluded by their target property or directory property. The name is used for this purpose for the Xcode and Visual Studio generators. Lists the targets available for build. This target is available when using the or generator, and the exact output is tool-specific. Delete built object files and other output files. The based generators create a target per directory, so that an individual directory can be cleaned. The tool provides its own granular system. Runs tests. This target is only automatically available if the CMake files provide CTest-based tests. See also Running Tests. Installs the software. This target is only automatically available if the software defines install rules with the command. See also Software Installation. Creates a binary package. This target is only automatically available if the CMake files provide CPack-based packages. Creates a source package. This target is only automatically available if the CMake files provide CPack-based packages. For based systems, variants of binary build targets are provided. The variants are used to build the specified target without regard for its dependencies. The dependencies are not checked and are not rebuilt if out of date. The generator is sufficiently fast at dependency checking that such targets are not provided for that generator. based systems also provide build-targets to preprocess, assemble and compile individual files in a particular directory. The file extension is built into the name of the target because another file with the same name but a different extension may exist. However, build-targets without the file extension are also provided. In buildsystems which contain and , building the target will preprocess both files. The program invoked by the mode is determined by the variable. For most generators, the particular program does not need to be configured. The tool is capable of reading makefiles of the flavor and building in parallel, while the tool always builds serially. After generating with the generator a user can run instead of . The mode would also use if the was set to while using the generator, and as a convenience, the generator is provided to find in the normal way and use it as the . For completeness, is an alternative tool which can process the output of the generator, but doing so would be a pessimization.\n\nThe variable can be set in the CMake cache to specify where to install the provided software. If the provided software has install rules, specified using the command, they will install artifacts into that prefix. On Windows, the default installation location corresponds to the system directory which may be architecture specific. On Unix hosts, is the default installation location. The variable always refers to the installation prefix on the target filesystem. In cross-compiling or packaging scenarios where the sysroot is read-only or where the sysroot should otherwise remain pristine, the variable can be set to a location to actually install the files. result in files being installed to paths such as on the host machine. The location on the host machine is not affected. Some provided software may specify rules, but CMake does not generate such rules by default itself.\n\nThe tool is shipped with the CMake distribution to execute provided tests and report results. The build-target is provided to run all available tests, but the tool allows granular control over which tests to run, how to run them, and how to report results. Executing in the build directory is equivalent to running the target: A regular expression can be passed to run only tests which match the expression. To run only tests with in their name: Tests can be excluded by regular expression too. To run only tests without in their name: Tests can be run in parallel by passing arguments to : The environment variable can alternatively be set to avoid the need to pass . By default does not print the output from the tests. The command line argument (or ) enables verbose mode to print the output from all tests. The option prints the test output for failing tests only. The environment variable can be set to as an alternative to passing the option to ."

        "document": "The \"cmake\" executable is the CMake command-line interface. It may be used to configure projects in scripts. Project configuration settings may be specified on the command line with the -D option. The -i option will cause cmake to interactively prompt for such settings.\n\nCMake is a cross-platform build system generator. Projects specify their build process with platform-independent CMake listfiles included in each directory of a source tree with the name CMakeLists.txt. Users build a project by using CMake to generate a build system for a native tool on their platform.\n• : Pre-load a script to populate the cache.\n\n When cmake is first run in an empty build tree, it creates a CMakeCache.txt file and populates it with customizable settings for the project. This option may be used to specify a file from which to load cache entries before the first pass through the project's cmake listfiles. The loaded entries take priority over the project's default values. The given file should be a CMake script containing SET commands that use the CACHE option, not a cache-format file.\n• : Create a cmake cache entry.\n\n When cmake is first run in an empty build tree, it creates a CMakeCache.txt file and populates it with customizable settings for the project. This option may be used to specify a setting that takes priority over the project's default value. The option may be repeated for as many cache entries as desired.\n• : Remove matching entries from CMake cache.\n\n This option may be used to remove one or more variables from the CMakeCache.txt file, globbing expressions using * and ? are supported. The option may be repeated for as many cache entries as desired.\n\n Use with care, you can make your CMakeCache.txt non-working.\n• : Specify a makefile generator.\n\n CMake may support multiple native build systems on certain platforms. A makefile generator is responsible for generating a particular build system. Possible generator names are specified in the Generators section.\n• : Suppress developer warnings.\n\n Suppress warnings that are meant for the author of the CMakeLists.txt files.\n• : Enable developer warnings.\n\n Enable warnings that are meant for the author of the CMakeLists.txt files.\n• : CMake command mode.\n\n For true platform independence, CMake provides a list of commands that can be used on all systems. Run with -E help for the usage information. Commands available are: chdir, copy, copy_if_different copy_directory, compare_files, echo, echo_append, environment, make_directory, md5sum, remove_directory, remove, tar, time, touch, touch_nocreate, write_regv, delete_regv, comspec, create_symlink.\n• : Run in wizard mode.\n\n Wizard mode runs cmake interactively without a GUI. The user is prompted to answer questions about the project configuration. The answers are used to set cmake cache values.\n• : List non-advanced cached variables.\n\n List cache variables will run CMake and list all the variables from the CMake cache that are not marked as INTERNAL or ADVANCED. This will effectively display current CMake settings, which can be then changed with -D option. Changing some of the variable may result in more variables being created. If A is specified, then it will display also advanced variables. If H is specified, it will also display help for each variable.\n• : Build a CMake-generated project binary tree.\n\n This abstracts a native build tool's command-line interface with the following options:\n\n <dir> = Project binary directory to be built.\n\n --target <tgt> = Build <tgt> instead of default targets.\n\n --config <cfg> = For multi-configuration tools, choose <cfg>.\n\n --clean-first = Build target 'clean' first, then build.\n\n (To clean only, use --target 'clean'.)\n\n -- = Pass remaining options to the native tool.\n\n Run cmake --build with no options for quick help.\n• : View mode only.\n\n Only load the cache. Do not actually run configure and generate steps.\n• : Process script mode.\n\n Process the given cmake file as a script written in the CMake language. No configure or generate step is performed and the cache is not modified. If variables are defined using -D, this must be done before the -P argument.\n• : Generate graphviz of dependencies.\n\n Generate a graphviz input file that will contain all the library and executable dependencies in the project.\n• : Dump information about this system.\n\n Dump a wide range of information about the current system. If run from the top of a binary tree for a CMake project it will dump additional information such as the cache, log files etc.\n• : Do not delete the try compile directories..\n\n Do not delete the files and directories created for try_compile calls. This is useful in debugging failed try_compiles. It may however change the results of the try-compiles as old junk from a previous try-compile may cause a different test to either pass or fail incorrectly. This option is best used for one try-compile at a time, and only when debugging.\n• : Put cmake in a debug mode.\n\n Print extra stuff during the cmake run like stack traces with message(send_error ) calls.\n• : Put cmake in trace mode.\n\n Print a trace of all calls made and from where with message(send_error ) calls.\n• : Print help for a single command and exit.\n\n Full documentation specific to the given command is displayed.

If a file is specified, the help is written into it.\n• : Show program name/version banner and exit.\n\n If a file is specified, the version is written into it.\n\nThe following generators are available on this platform:\n• : Generates MSYS makefiles.\n\n The makefiles use /bin/sh as the shell. They require msys to be installed on the machine.\n• : Generates a make file for use with mingw32-make.\n\n The makefiles generated use cmd.exe as the shell. They do not require msys or a unix shell.\n• : Generates standard UNIX makefiles.\n\n A hierarchy of UNIX makefiles is generated into the build tree. Any standard UNIX-style make program can build the project through the default make target. A \"make install\" target is also provided.\n• : Generates CodeBlocks project files.\n\n Project files for CodeBlocks will be created in the top directory and in every subdirectory which features a CMakeLists.txt file containing a PROJECT() call. Additionally a hierarchy of makefiles is generated into the build tree. The appropriate make program can build the project through the default make target. A \"make install\" target is also provided.\n• : Generates CodeBlocks project files.\n\n Project files for CodeBlocks will be created in the top directory and in every subdirectory which features a CMakeLists.txt file containing a PROJECT() call. Additionally a hierarchy of makefiles is generated into the build tree. The appropriate make program can build the project through the default make target. A \"make install\" target is also provided.\n• : Generates CodeBlocks project files.\n\n Project files for CodeBlocks will be created in the top directory and in every subdirectory which features a CMakeLists.txt file containing a PROJECT() call. Additionally a hierarchy of makefiles is generated into the build tree. The appropriate make program can build the project through the default make target. A \"make install\" target is also provided.\n• : Generates Eclipse CDT 4.0 project files.\n\n Project files for Eclipse will be created in the top directory. In out of source builds, a linked resource to the top level source directory will be created.Additionally a hierarchy of makefiles is generated into the build tree. The appropriate make program can build the project through the default make target. A \"make install\" target is also provided.\n• : Generates Eclipse CDT 4.0 project files.\n\n Project files for Eclipse will be created in the top directory. In out of source builds, a linked resource to the top level source directory will be created.Additionally a hierarchy of makefiles is generated into the build tree. The appropriate make program can build the project through the default make target. A \"make install\" target is also provided.\n• : Generates Eclipse CDT 4.0 project files.\n\n Project files for Eclipse will be created in the top directory. In out of source builds, a linked resource to the top level source directory will be created.Additionally a hierarchy of makefiles is generated into the build tree. The appropriate make program can build the project through the default make target. A \"make install\" target is also provided.\n• : Add a custom build rule to the generated build system.\n\n There are two main signatures for add_custom_command The first signature is for adding a custom command to produce an output.\n\n This defines a command to generate specified OUTPUT file(s). A target created in the same directory (CMakeLists.txt file) that specifies any output of the custom command as a source file is given a rule to generate the file using the command at build time. If an output name is a relative path it will be interpreted relative to the build tree directory corresponding to the current source directory. Note that MAIN_DEPENDENCY is completely optional and is used as a suggestion to visual studio about where to hang the custom command. In makefile terms this creates a new target in the following form:\n\n If more than one command is specified they will be executed in order. The optional ARGS argument is for backward compatibility and will be ignored.\n\n The second signature adds a custom command to a target such as a library or executable. This is useful for performing an operation before or after building the target. The command becomes part of the target and will only execute when the target itself is built. If the target is already built, the command will not execute.\n\n This defines a new command that will be associated with building the specified target. When the command will happen is determined by which of the following is specified:\n\n PRE_BUILD - run before all other dependencies\n\n PRE_LINK - run after other dependencies\n\n POST_BUILD - run after the target has been built\n\n Note that the PRE_BUILD option is only supported on Visual Studio 7 or later. For all other generators PRE_BUILD will be treated as PRE_LINK.\n\n If WORKING_DIRECTORY is specified the command will be executed in the directory given. If COMMENT is set, the value will be displayed as a message before the commands are executed at build time. If APPEND is specified the COMMAND and DEPENDS option values are appended to the custom command for the first output specified. There must have already been a previous call to this command with the same output. The COMMENT, WORKING_DIRECTORY, and MAIN_DEPENDENCY options are currently ignored when APPEND is given, but may be used in the future.\n\n If VERBATIM is given then all arguments to the commands will be escaped properly for the build tool so that the invoked command receives each argument unchanged. Note that one level of escapes is still used by the CMake language processor before add_custom_command even sees the arguments. Use of VERBATIM is recommended as it enables correct behavior. When VERBATIM is not given the behavior is platform specific because there is no protection of tool-specific special characters.\n\n If the output of the custom command is not actually created as a file on disk it should be marked as SYMBOLIC with SET_SOURCE_FILES_PROPERTIES.\n\n The IMPLICIT_DEPENDS option requests scanning of implicit dependencies of an input file. The language given specifies the programming language whose corresponding dependency scanner should be used. Currently only C and CXX language scanners are supported. Dependencies discovered from the scanning are added to those of the custom command at build time. Note that the IMPLICIT_DEPENDS option is currently supported only for Makefile generators and will be ignored by other generators.\n\n If COMMAND specifies an executable target (created by ADD_EXECUTABLE) it will automatically be replaced by the location of the executable created at build time. Additionally a target-level dependency will be added so that the executable target will be built before any target using this custom command. However this does NOT add a file-level dependency that would cause the custom command to re-run whenever the executable is recompiled.\n\n The DEPENDS option specifies files on which the command depends. If any dependency is an OUTPUT of another custom command in the same directory (CMakeLists.txt file) CMake automatically brings the other custom command into the target in which this command is built. If DEPENDS specifies any target (created by an ADD_* command) a target-level dependency is created to make sure the target is built before any target using this custom command. Additionally, if the target is an executable or library a file-level dependency is created to cause the custom command to re-run whenever the target is recompiled.\n• : Add a target with no output so it will always be built.\n\n Adds a target with the given name that executes the given commands. The target has no output file and is ALWAYS CONSIDERED OUT OF DATE even if the commands try to create a file with the name of the target. Use ADD_CUSTOM_COMMAND to generate a file with dependencies. By default nothing depends on the custom target. Use ADD_DEPENDENCIES to add dependencies to or from other targets. If the ALL option is specified it indicates that this target should be added to the default build target so that it will be run every time (the command cannot be called ALL). The command and arguments are optional and if not specified an empty target will be created. If WORKING_DIRECTORY is set, then the command will be run in that directory. If COMMENT is set, the value will be displayed as a message before the commands are executed at build time. Dependencies listed with the DEPENDS argument may reference files and outputs of custom commands created with add_custom_command() in the same directory (CMakeLists.txt file).\n\n If VERBATIM is given then all arguments to the commands will be escaped properly for the build tool so that the invoked command receives each argument unchanged. Note that one level of escapes is still used by the CMake language processor before add_custom_target even sees the arguments. Use of VERBATIM is recommended as it enables correct behavior. When VERBATIM is not given the behavior is platform specific because there is no protection of tool-specific special characters.\n\n The SOURCES option specifies additional source files to be included in the custom target. Specified source files will be added to IDE project files for convenience in editing even if they have not build rules.\n• : Adds -D define flags to the compilation of source files.\n\n Adds flags to the compiler command line for sources in the current directory and below. This command can be used to add any flags, but it was originally intended to add preprocessor definitions. Flags beginning in -D or /D that look like preprocessor definitions are automatically added to the COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property for the current directory. Definitions with non-trival values may be left in the set of flags instead of being converted for reasons of backwards compatibility. See documentation of the directory, target, and source file COMPILE_DEFINITIONS properties for details on adding preprocessor definitions to specific scopes and configurations.\n• : Add a dependency between top-level targets.\n\n Make a top-level target depend on other top-level targets. A top-level target is one created by ADD_EXECUTABLE, ADD_LIBRARY, or ADD_CUSTOM_TARGET. Adding dependencies with this command can be used to make sure one target is built before another target. See the DEPENDS option of ADD_CUSTOM_TARGET and ADD_CUSTOM_COMMAND for adding file-level dependencies in custom rules. See the OBJECT_DEPENDS option in SET_SOURCE_FILES_PROPERTIES to add file-level dependencies to object files.\n• : Add an executable to the project using the specified source files.\n\n Adds an executable target called <name> to be built from the source files listed in the command invocation. The <name> corresponds to the logical target name and must be globally unique within a project. The actual file name of the executable built is constructed based on conventions of the native platform (such as <name>.exe or just <name>). \n\n By default the executable file will be created in the build tree directory corresponding to the source tree directory in which the command was invoked. See documentation of the RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY target property to change this location. See documentation of the OUTPUT_NAME target property to change the <name> part of the final file name. \n\n If WIN32 is given the property WIN32_EXECUTABLE will be set on the target created. See documentation of that target property for details.\n\n If MACOSX_BUNDLE is given the corresponding property will be set on the created target. See documentation of the MACOSX_BUNDLE target property for details.\n\n If EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL is given the corresponding property will be set on the created target. See documentation of the EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL target property for details.\n\n The add_executable command can also create IMPORTED executable targets using this signature:\n\n An IMPORTED executable target references an executable file located outside the project. No rules are generated to build it. The target name has scope in the directory in which it is created and below. It may be referenced like any target built within the project. IMPORTED executables are useful for convenient reference from commands like add_custom_command. Details about the imported executable are specified by setting properties whose names begin in \"IMPORTED_\". The most important such property is IMPORTED_LOCATION (and its per-configuration version IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>) which specifies the location of the main executable file on disk. See documentation of the IMPORTED_* properties for more information.\n• : Add a library to the project using the specified source files.\n\n Adds a library target called <name> to be built from the source files listed in the command invocation. The <name> corresponds to the logical target name and must be globally unique within a project. The actual file name of the library built is constructed based on conventions of the native platform (such as lib<name>.a or <name>.lib).\n\n STATIC, SHARED, or MODULE may be given to specify the type of library to be created. STATIC libraries are archives of object files for use when linking other targets. SHARED libraries are linked dynamically and loaded at runtime. MODULE libraries are plugins that are not linked into other targets but may be loaded dynamically at runtime using dlopen-like functionality. If no type is given explicitly the type is STATIC or SHARED based on whether the current value of the variable BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is true.\n\n By default the library file will be created in the build tree directory corresponding to the source tree directory in which the command was invoked. See documentation of the ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, and RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY target properties to change this location. See documentation of the OUTPUT_NAME target property to change the <name> part of the final file name. \n\n If EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL is given the corresponding property will be set on the created target. See documentation of the EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL target property for details.\n\n The add_library command can also create IMPORTED library targets using this signature:\n\n An IMPORTED library target references a library file located outside the project. No rules are generated to build it. The target name has scope in the directory in which it is created and below. It may be referenced like any target built within the project. IMPORTED libraries are useful for convenient reference from commands like target_link_libraries. Details about the imported library are specified by setting properties whose names begin in \"IMPORTED_\". The most important such property is IMPORTED_LOCATION (and its per-configuration version IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>) which specifies the location of the main library file on disk. See documentation of the IMPORTED_* properties for more information.\n• : Add a subdirectory to the build.\n\n Add a subdirectory to the build. The source_dir specifies the directory in which the source CmakeLists.txt and code files are located. If it is a relative path it will be evaluated with respect to the current directory (the typical usage), but it may also be an absolute path. The binary_dir specifies the directory in which to place the output files. If it is a relative path it will be evaluated with respect to the current output directory, but it may also be an absolute path. If binary_dir is not specified, the value of source_dir, before expanding any relative path, will be used (the typical usage). The CMakeLists.txt file in the specified source directory will be processed immediately by CMake before processing in the current input file continues beyond this command.\n\n If the EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL argument is provided then targets in the subdirectory will not be included in the ALL target of the parent directory by default, and will be excluded from IDE project files. Users must explicitly build targets in the subdirectory. This is meant for use when the subdirectory contains a separate part of the project that is useful but not necessary, such as a set of examples. Typically the subdirectory should contain its own project() command invocation so that a full build system will be generated in the subdirectory (such as a VS IDE solution file). Note that inter-target dependencies supercede this exclusion. If a target built by the parent project depends on a target in the subdirectory, the dependee target will be included in the parent project build system to satisfy the dependency.\n• : Add a test to the project with the specified arguments.\n\n If the ENABLE_TESTING command has been run, this command adds a test target to the current directory. If ENABLE_TESTING has not been run, this command does nothing. The tests are run by the testing subsystem by executing Exename with the specified arguments. Exename can be either an executable built by this project or an arbitrary executable on the system (like tclsh). The test will be run with the current working directory set to the CMakeList.txt files corresponding directory in the binary tree.\n\n If COMMAND specifies an executable target (created by add_executable) it will automatically be replaced by the location of the executable created at build time. If a CONFIGURATIONS option is given then the test will be executed only when testing under one of the named configurations.\n\n Arguments after COMMAND may use \"generator expressions\" with the syntax \"$<...>\". These expressions are evaluted during build system generation and produce information specific to each generated build configuration. Valid expressions are:\n\n $<CONFIGURATION> = configuration name\n\n $<TARGET_FILE:tgt> = main file (.exe, .so.1.2, .a)\n\n $<TARGET_LINKER_FILE:tgt> = file used to link (.a, .lib, .so)\n\n $<TARGET_SONAME_FILE:tgt> = file with soname (.so.3)\n\n where \"tgt\" is the name of a target. Target file expressions produce a full path, but _DIR and _NAME versions can produce the directory and file name components:\n\n This creates a test \"mytest\" whose command runs a testDriver tool passing the configuration name and the full path to the executable file produced by target \"myexe\".\n• : Find all source files in a directory.\n\n Collects the names of all the source files in the specified directory and stores the list in the <variable> provided. This command is intended to be used by projects that use explicit template instantiation. Template instantiation files can be stored in a \"Templates\" subdirectory and collected automatically using this command to avoid manually listing all instantiations.\n\n It is tempting to use this command to avoid writing the list of source files for a library or executable target. While this seems to work, there is no way for CMake to generate a build system that knows when a new source file has been added. Normally the generated build system knows when it needs to rerun CMake because the CMakeLists.txt file is modified to add a new source. When the source is just added to the directory without modifying this file, one would have to manually rerun CMake to generate a build system incorporating the new file.\n• : Break from an enclosing foreach or while loop.\n\n Breaks from an enclosing foreach loop or while loop\n• : Get the command line to build this project.\n\n Sets the given <variable> to a string containing the command line for building one configuration of a target in a project using the build tool appropriate for the current CMAKE_GENERATOR.\n\n If CONFIGURATION is omitted, CMake chooses a reasonable default value for multi-configuration generators. CONFIGURATION is ignored for single-configuration generators.\n\n If PROJECT_NAME is omitted, the resulting command line will build the top level PROJECT in the current build tree.\n\n If TARGET is omitted, the resulting command line will build everything, effectively using build target 'all' or 'ALL_BUILD'.\n\n This second signature is deprecated, but still available for backwards compatibility. Use the first signature instead.\n\n Sets the given <cachevariable> to a string containing the command to build this project from the root of the build tree using the build tool given by <makecommand>. <makecommand> should be the full path to msdev, devenv, nmake, make or one of the end user build tools.\n• : Set the minimum required version of cmake for a project.\n\n If the current version of CMake is lower than that required it will stop processing the project and report an error. When a version higher than 2.4 is specified the command implicitly invokes\n\n which sets the cmake policy version level to the version specified. When version 2.4 or lower is given the command implicitly invokes\n\n which enables compatibility features for CMake 2.4 and lower.\n\n The FATAL_ERROR option is accepted but ignored by CMake 2.6 and higher. It should be specified so CMake versions 2.4 and lower fail with an error instead of just a warning.\n• : Manage CMake Policy settings.\n\n As CMake evolves it is sometimes necessary to change existing behavior in order to fix bugs or improve implementations of existing features. The CMake Policy mechanism is designed to help keep existing projects building as new versions of CMake introduce changes in behavior. Each new policy (behavioral change) is given an identifier of the form \"CMP<NNNN>\" where \"<NNNN>\" is an integer index. Documentation associated with each policy describes the OLD and NEW behavior and the reason the policy was introduced. Projects may set each policy to select the desired behavior. When CMake needs to know which behavior to use it checks for a setting specified by the project. If no setting is available the OLD behavior is assumed and a warning is produced requesting that the policy be set.\n\n The cmake_policy command is used to set policies to OLD or NEW behavior. While setting policies individually is supported, we encourage projects to set policies based on CMake versions.\n\n Specify that the current CMake list file is written for the given version of CMake. All policies introduced in the specified version or earlier will be set to use NEW behavior. All policies introduced after the specified version will be unset. This effectively requests behavior preferred as of a given CMake version and tells newer CMake versions to warn about their new policies. The policy version specified must be at least 2.4 or the command will report an error. In order to get compatibility features supporting versions earlier than 2.4 see documentation of policy CMP0001.\n\n Tell CMake to use the OLD or NEW behavior for a given policy. Projects depending on the old behavior of a given policy may silence a policy warning by setting the policy state to OLD. Alternatively one may fix the project to work with the new behavior and set the policy state to NEW.\n\n Check whether a given policy is set to OLD or NEW behavior. The output variable value will be \"OLD\" or \"NEW\" if the policy is set, and empty otherwise.\n\n CMake keeps policy settings on a stack, so changes made by the cmake_policy command affect only the top of the stack. A new entry on the policy stack is managed automatically for each subdirectory to protect its parents and siblings. CMake also manages a new entry for scripts loaded by include() and find_package() commands except when invoked with the NO_POLICY_SCOPE option (see also policy CMP0011). The cmake_policy command provides an interface to manage custom entries on the policy stack:\n\n Each PUSH must have a matching POP to erase any changes. This is useful to make temporary changes to policy settings.\n\n Functions and macros record policy settings when they are created and use the pre-record policies when they are invoked. If the function or macro implementation sets policies, the changes automatically propagate up through callers until they reach the closest nested policy stack entry.\n• : Copy a file to another location and modify its contents.\n\n Copies a file <input> to file <output> and substitutes variable values referenced in the file content. If <input> is a relative path it is evaluated with respect to the current source directory. The <input> must be a file, not a directory. If <output> is a relative path it is evaluated with respect to the current binary directory. If <output> names an existing directory the input file is placed in that directory with its original name. \n\n This command replaces any variables in the input file referenced as ${VAR} or @VAR@ with their values as determined by CMake. If a variable is not defined, it will be replaced with nothing. If COPYONLY is specified, then no variable expansion will take place. If ESCAPE_QUOTES is specified then any substituted quotes will be C-style escaped. The file will be configured with the current values of CMake variables. If @ONLY is specified, only variables of the form @VAR@ will be replaces and ${VAR} will be ignored. This is useful for configuring scripts that use ${VAR}. Any occurrences of #cmakedefine VAR will be replaced with either #define VAR or /* #undef VAR */ depending on the setting of VAR in CMake. Any occurrences of #cmakedefine01 VAR will be replaced with either #define VAR 1 or #define VAR 0 depending on whether VAR evaluates to TRUE or FALSE in CMake\n• : Create a test driver and source list for building test programs.\n\n A test driver is a program that links together many small tests into a single executable. This is useful when building static executables with large libraries to shrink the total required size. The list of source files needed to build the test driver will be in sourceListName. DriverName is the name of the test driver program. The rest of the arguments consist of a list of test source files, can be semicolon separated. Each test source file should have a function in it that is the same name as the file with no extension (foo.cxx should have int foo(int, char*[]);) DriverName will be able to call each of the tests by name on the command line. If EXTRA_INCLUDE is specified, then the next argument is included into the generated file. If FUNCTION is specified, then the next argument is taken as a function name that is passed a pointer to ac and av. This can be used to add extra command line processing to each test. The cmake variable CMAKE_TESTDRIVER_BEFORE_TESTMAIN can be set to have code that will be placed directly before calling the test main function. CMAKE_TESTDRIVER_AFTER_TESTMAIN can be set to have code that will be placed directly after the call to the test main function.\n• : Define and document custom properties.\n\n Define one property in a scope for use with the set_property and get_property commands. This is primarily useful to associate documentation with property names that may be retrieved with the get_property command. The first argument determines the kind of scope in which the property should be used. It must be one of the following:\n\n GLOBAL = associated with the global namespace\n\n DIRECTORY = associated with one directory\n\n TARGET = associated with one target\n\n SOURCE = associated with one source file\n\n TEST = associated with a test named with add_test\n\n VARIABLE = documents a CMake language variable\n\n CACHED_VARIABLE = documents a CMake cache variable\n\n Note that unlike set_property and get_property no actual scope needs to be given; only the kind of scope is important.\n\n The required PROPERTY option is immediately followed by the name of the property being defined.\n\n If the INHERITED option then the get_property command will chain up to the next higher scope when the requested property is not set in the scope given to the command. DIRECTORY scope chains to GLOBAL. TARGET, SOURCE, and TEST chain to DIRECTORY.\n\n The BRIEF_DOCS and FULL_DOCS options are followed by strings to be associated with the property as its brief and full documentation. Corresponding options to the get_property command will retrieve the documentation.\n• : Starts the else portion of an if block.\n\n See the if command.\n• : Starts the elseif portion of an if block.\n\n See the if command.\n• : Enable a language (CXX/C/Fortran/etc)\n\n This command enables support for the named language in CMake. This is the same as the project command but does not create any of the extra variables that are created by the project command. Example languages are CXX, C, Fortran. If OPTIONAL is used, use the CMAKE_<languageName>_COMPILER_WORKS variable to check whether the language has been enabled successfully.\n• : Enable testing for current directory and below.\n\n Enables testing for this directory and below. See also the add_test command. Note that ctest expects to find a test file in the build directory root. Therefore, this command should be in the source directory root.\n• : Ends a list of commands in an if block.\n\n See the if command.\n• : Ends a list of commands in a while block.\n\n See the while command.\n• : Execute one or more child processes.\n\n Runs the given sequence of one or more commands with the standard output of each process piped to the standard input of the next. A single standard error pipe is used for all processes. If WORKING_DIRECTORY is given the named directory will be set as the current working directory of the child processes. If TIMEOUT is given the child processes will be terminated if they do not finish in the specified number of seconds (fractions are allowed). If RESULT_VARIABLE is given the variable will be set to contain the result of running the processes. This will be an integer return code from the last child or a string describing an error condition. If OUTPUT_VARIABLE or ERROR_VARIABLE are given the variable named will be set with the contents of the standard output and standard error pipes respectively. If the same variable is named for both pipes their output will be merged in the order produced. If INPUT_FILE, OUTPUT_FILE, or ERROR_FILE is given the file named will be attached to the standard input of the first process, standard output of the last process, or standard error of all processes respectively. If OUTPUT_QUIET or ERROR_QUIET is given then the standard output or standard error results will be quietly ignored. If more than one OUTPUT_* or ERROR_* option is given for the same pipe the precedence is not specified. If no OUTPUT_* or ERROR_* options are given the output will be shared with the corresponding pipes of the CMake process itself.\n\n The execute_process command is a newer more powerful version of exec_program, but the old command has been kept for compatibility.\n• : Export targets from the build tree for use by outside projects.\n\n Create a file <filename> that may be included by outside projects to import targets from the current project's build tree. This is useful during cross-compiling to build utility executables that can run on the host platform in one project and then import them into another project being compiled for the target platform. If the NAMESPACE option is given the <namespace> string will be prepended to all target names written to the file. If the APPEND option is given the generated code will be appended to the file instead of overwriting it. If a library target is included in the export but a target to which it links is not included the behavior is unspecified.\n\n The file created by this command is specific to the build tree and should never be installed. See the install(EXPORT) command to export targets from an installation tree.\n\n Store the current build directory in the CMake user package registry for package <name>. The find_package command may consider the directory while searching for package <name>. This helps dependent projects find and use a package from the current project's build tree without help from the user. Note that the entry in the package registry that this command creates works only in conjunction with a package configuration file (<name>Config.cmake) that works with the build tree.\n• : File manipulation command.\n\n WRITE will write a message into a file called 'filename'. It overwrites the file if it already exists, and creates the file if it does not exist.\n\n APPEND will write a message into a file same as WRITE, except it will append it to the end of the file\n\n READ will read the content of a file and store it into the variable. It will start at the given offset and read up to numBytes. If the argument HEX is given, the binary data will be converted to hexadecimal representation and this will be stored in the variable.\n\n STRINGS will parse a list of ASCII strings from a file and store it in a variable. Binary data in the file are ignored. Carriage return (CR) characters are ignored. It works also for Intel Hex and Motorola S-record files, which are automatically converted to binary format when reading them. Disable this using NO_HEX_CONVERSION.\n\n LIMIT_COUNT sets the maximum number of strings to return. LIMIT_INPUT sets the maximum number of bytes to read from the input file. LIMIT_OUTPUT sets the maximum number of bytes to store in the output variable. LENGTH_MINIMUM sets the minimum length of a string to return. Shorter strings are ignored. LENGTH_MAXIMUM sets the maximum length of a string to return. Longer strings are split into strings no longer than the maximum length. NEWLINE_CONSUME allows newlines to be included in strings instead of terminating them.\n\n REGEX specifies a regular expression that a string must match to be returned. Typical usage \n\n stores a list in the variable \"myfile\" in which each item is a line from the input file.\n\n GLOB will generate a list of all files that match the globbing expressions and store it into the variable. Globbing expressions are similar to regular expressions, but much simpler. If RELATIVE flag is specified for an expression, the results will be returned as a relative path to the given path.\n\n *.cxx - match all files with extension cxx\n\n *.vt? - match all files with extension vta,...,vtz\n\n f[3-5].txt - match files f3.txt, f4.txt, f5.txt\n\n GLOB_RECURSE will generate a list similar to the regular GLOB, except it will traverse all the subdirectories of the matched directory and match the files. Subdirectories that are symlinks are only traversed if FOLLOW_SYMLINKS is given or cmake policy CMP0009 is not set to NEW. See cmake --help-policy CMP0009 for more information.\n\n /dir/*.py - match all python files in /dir and subdirectories\n\n MAKE_DIRECTORY will create the given directories, also if their parent directories don't exist yet\n\n RENAME moves a file or directory within a filesystem, replacing the destination atomically.\n\n REMOVE will remove the given files, also in subdirectories\n\n REMOVE_RECURSE will remove the given files and directories, also non-empty directories\n\n RELATIVE_PATH will determine relative path from directory to the given file.\n\n TO_CMAKE_PATH will convert path into a cmake style path with unix /. The input can be a single path or a system path like \"$ENV{PATH}\". Note the double quotes around the ENV call TO_CMAKE_PATH only takes one argument.\n\n TO_NATIVE_PATH works just like TO_CMAKE_PATH, but will convert from a cmake style path into the native path style \\ for windows and / for UNIX.\n\n DOWNLOAD will download the given URL to the given file. If LOG var is specified a log of the download will be put in var. If STATUS var is specified the status of the operation will be put in var. The status is returned in a list of length 2. The first element is the numeric return value for the operation, and the second element is a string value for the error. A 0 numeric error means no error in the operation. If TIMEOUT time is specified, the operation will timeout after time seconds, time should be specified as an integer.\n\n The file() command also provides COPY and INSTALL signatures:\n\n The COPY signature copies files, directories, and symlinks to a destination folder. Relative input paths are evaluated with respect to the current source directory, and a relative destination is evaluated with respect to the current build directory. Copying preserves input file timestamps, and optimizes out a file if it exists at the destination with the same timestamp. Copying preserves input permissions unless explicit permissions or NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS are given (default is USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS). See the install(DIRECTORY) command for documentation of permissions, PATTERN, REGEX, and EXCLUDE options. \n\n The INSTALL signature differs slightly from COPY: it prints status messages, and NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS is default. Installation scripts generated by the install() command use this signature (with some undocumented options for internal use).\n• : Find the full path to a file.\n\n This is the short-hand signature for the command that is sufficient in many cases. It is the same as find_file(<VAR> name1 [PATHS path1 path2 ...])\n\n This command is used to find a full path to named file. A cache entry named by <VAR> is created to store the result of this command. If the full path to a file is found the result is stored in the variable and the search will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared. If nothing is found, the result will be <VAR>-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted again the next time find_file is invoked with the same variable. The name of the full path to a file that is searched for is specified by the names listed after the NAMES argument. Additional search locations can be specified after the PATHS argument. If ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section the environment variable var will be read and converted from a system environment variable to a cmake style list of paths. For example ENV PATH would be a way to list the system path variable. The argument after DOC will be used for the documentation string in the cache. PATH_SUFFIXES specifies additional subdirectories to check below each search path.\n\n If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional paths are added to the search. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not specified, the search process is as follows:\n\n 1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache variables. These are intended to be used on the command line with a -DVAR=value. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is passed.\n\n <prefix>/include for each <prefix> in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH\n\n CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH\n\n CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH\n\n 2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables. These are intended to be set in the user's shell configuration. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.\n\n <prefix>/include for each <prefix> in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH\n\n CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH\n\n CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH\n\n 3. Search the paths specified by the HINTS option. These should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a hint provided by the location of another item already found. Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the PATHS option.\n\n 4. Search the standard system environment variables. This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an argument.\n\n 5. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files for the current system. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is passed.\n\n <prefix>/include for each <prefix> in CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH\n\n CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH\n\n CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH\n\n 6. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option or in the short-hand version of the command. These are typically hard-coded guesses.\n\n On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or one of the following:\n\n \"FIRST\" - Try to find frameworks before standard\n\n libraries or headers. This is the default on Darwin.\n\n \"LAST\" - Try to find frameworks after standard\n\n libraries or headers.\n\n \"ONLY\" - Only try to find frameworks.\n\n \"NEVER\" - Never try to find frameworks.\n\n On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set to empty or one of the following:\n\n \"FIRST\" - Try to find application bundles before standard\n\n programs. This is the default on Darwin.\n\n \"LAST\" - Try to find application bundles after standard\n\n programs.\n\n \"ONLY\" - Only try to find application bundles.\n\n \"NEVER\" - Never try to find application bundles.\n\n The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or more directories to be prepended to all other search directories. This effectively \"re-roots\" the entire search under given locations. By default it is empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake will search there too. By default at first the directories listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted directories will be searched. The default behavior can be adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE. This behavior can be manually overridden on a per-call basis. By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted directories will be searched.\n\n The default search order is designed to be most-specific to least-specific for common use cases. Projects may override the order by simply calling the command multiple times and using the NO_* options:\n\n Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search again.\n• : Find a library.\n\n This is the short-hand signature for the command that is sufficient in many cases. It is the same as find_library(<VAR> name1 [PATHS path1 path2 ...])\n\n This command is used to find a library. A cache entry named by <VAR> is created to store the result of this command. If the library is found the result is stored in the variable and the search will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared. If nothing is found, the result will be <VAR>-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted again the next time find_library is invoked with the same variable. The name of the library that is searched for is specified by the names listed after the NAMES argument. Additional search locations can be specified after the PATHS argument. If ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section the environment variable var will be read and converted from a system environment variable to a cmake style list of paths. For example ENV PATH would be a way to list the system path variable. The argument after DOC will be used for the documentation string in the cache. PATH_SUFFIXES specifies additional subdirectories to check below each search path.\n\n If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional paths are added to the search. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not specified, the search process is as follows:\n\n 1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache variables. These are intended to be used on the command line with a -DVAR=value. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is passed.\n\n <prefix>/lib for each <prefix> in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH\n\n CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH\n\n CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH\n\n 2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables. These are intended to be set in the user's shell configuration. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.\n\n <prefix>/lib for each <prefix> in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH\n\n CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH\n\n CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH\n\n 3. Search the paths specified by the HINTS option. These should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a hint provided by the location of another item already found. Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the PATHS option.\n\n 4. Search the standard system environment variables. This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an argument.\n\n 5. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files for the current system. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is passed.\n\n <prefix>/lib for each <prefix> in CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH\n\n CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH\n\n CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH\n\n 6. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option or in the short-hand version of the command. These are typically hard-coded guesses.\n\n On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or one of the following:\n\n \"FIRST\" - Try to find frameworks before standard\n\n libraries or headers. This is the default on Darwin.\n\n \"LAST\" - Try to find frameworks after standard\n\n libraries or headers.\n\n \"ONLY\" - Only try to find frameworks.\n\n \"NEVER\" - Never try to find frameworks.\n\n On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set to empty or one of the following:\n\n \"FIRST\" - Try to find application bundles before standard\n\n programs. This is the default on Darwin.\n\n \"LAST\" - Try to find application bundles after standard\n\n programs.\n\n \"ONLY\" - Only try to find application bundles.\n\n \"NEVER\" - Never try to find application bundles.\n\n The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or more directories to be prepended to all other search directories. This effectively \"re-roots\" the entire search under given locations. By default it is empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake will search there too. By default at first the directories listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted directories will be searched. The default behavior can be adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY. This behavior can be manually overridden on a per-call basis. By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted directories will be searched.\n\n The default search order is designed to be most-specific to least-specific for common use cases. Projects may override the order by simply calling the command multiple times and using the NO_* options:\n\n Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search again.\n\n If the library found is a framework, then VAR will be set to the full path to the framework <fullPath>/A.framework. When a full path to a framework is used as a library, CMake will use a -framework A, and a -F<fullPath> to link the framework to the target.\n• : Load settings for an external project.\n\n Finds and loads settings from an external project. <package>_FOUND will be set to indicate whether the package was found. When the package is found package-specific information is provided through variables documented by the package itself. The QUIET option disables messages if the package cannot be found. The REQUIRED option stops processing with an error message if the package cannot be found. A package-specific list of components may be listed after the REQUIRED option or after the COMPONENTS option if no REQUIRED option is given. The [version] argument requests a version with which the package found should be compatible (format is major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]). The EXACT option requests that the version be matched exactly. If no [version] is given to a recursive invocation inside a find-module, the [version] and EXACT arguments are forwarded automatically from the outer call. Version support is currently provided only on a package-by-package basis (details below).\n\n User code should generally look for packages using the above simple signature. The remainder of this command documentation specifies the full command signature and details of the search process. Project maintainers wishing to provide a package to be found by this command are encouraged to read on.\n\n The command has two modes by which it searches for packages: \"Module\" mode and \"Config\" mode. Module mode is available when the command is invoked with the above reduced signature. CMake searches for a file called \"Find<package>.cmake\" in the CMAKE_MODULE_PATH followed by the CMake installation. If the file is found, it is read and processed by CMake. It is responsible for finding the package, checking the version, and producing any needed messages. Many find-modules provide limited or no support for versioning; check the module documentation. If no module is found the command proceeds to Config mode.\n\n The NO_MODULE option may be used to skip Module mode explicitly. It is also implied by use of options not specified in the reduced signature. \n\n Config mode attempts to locate a configuration file provided by the package to be found. A cache entry called <package>_DIR is created to hold the directory containing the file. By default the command searches for a package with the name <package>. If the NAMES option is given the names following it are used instead of <package>. The command searches for a file called \"<name>Config.cmake\" or \"<lower-case-name>-config.cmake\" for each name specified. A replacement set of possible configuration file names may be given using the CONFIGS option. The search procedure is specified below. Once found, the configuration file is read and processed by CMake. Since the file is provided by the package it already knows the location of package contents. The full path to the configuration file is stored in the cmake variable <package>_CONFIG.\n\n If the package configuration file cannot be found CMake will generate an error describing the problem unless the QUIET argument is specified. If REQUIRED is specified and the package is not found a fatal error is generated and the configure step stops executing. If <package>_DIR has been set to a directory not containing a configuration file CMake will ignore it and search from scratch.\n\n When the [version] argument is given Config mode will only find a version of the package that claims compatibility with the requested version (format is major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]). If the EXACT option is given only a version of the package claiming an exact match of the requested version may be found. CMake does not establish any convention for the meaning of version numbers. Package version numbers are checked by \"version\" files provided by the packages themselves. For a candidate package configuration file \"<config-file>.cmake\" the corresponding version file is located next to it and named either \"<config-file>-version.cmake\" or \"<config-file>Version.cmake\". If no such version file is available then the configuration file is assumed to not be compatible with any requested version. When a version file is found it is loaded to check the requested version number. The version file is loaded in a nested scope in which the following variables have been defined:\n\n PACKAGE_FIND_NAME = the <package> name\n\n PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION = full requested version string\n\n PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MAJOR = major version if requested, else 0\n\n PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if requested, else 0\n\n PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_PATCH = patch version if requested, else 0\n\n PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_TWEAK = tweak version if requested, else 0\n\n PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_COUNT = number of version components, 0 to 4\n\n The version file checks whether it satisfies the requested version and sets these variables:\n\n PACKAGE_VERSION = full provided version string\n\n PACKAGE_VERSION_EXACT = true if version is exact match\n\n PACKAGE_VERSION_COMPATIBLE = true if version is compatible\n\n PACKAGE_VERSION_UNSUITABLE = true if unsuitable as any version\n\n These variables are checked by the find_package command to determine whether the configuration file provides an acceptable version. They are not available after the find_package call returns. If the version is acceptable the following variables are set:\n\n <package>_VERSION = full provided version string\n\n <package>_VERSION_MAJOR = major version if provided, else 0\n\n <package>_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if provided, else 0\n\n <package>_VERSION_PATCH = patch version if provided, else 0\n\n <package>_VERSION_TWEAK = tweak version if provided, else 0\n\n <package>_VERSION_COUNT = number of version components, 0 to 4\n\n and the corresponding package configuration file is loaded. When multiple package configuration files are available whose version files claim compatibility with the version requested it is unspecified which one is chosen. No attempt is made to choose a highest or closest version number.\n\n Config mode provides an elaborate interface and search procedure. Much of the interface is provided for completeness and for use internally by find-modules loaded by Module mode. Most user code should simply call\n\n in order to find a package. Package maintainers providing CMake package configuration files are encouraged to name and install them such that the procedure outlined below will find them without requiring use of additional options.\n\n CMake constructs a set of possible installation prefixes for the package. Under each prefix several directories are searched for a configuration file. The tables below show the directories searched. Each entry is meant for installation trees following Windows (W), UNIX (U), or Apple (A) conventions.\n\n On systems supporting OS X Frameworks and Application Bundles the following directories are searched for frameworks or bundles containing a configuration file:\n\n <prefix>/<name>.framework/Resources/ (A)\n\n <prefix>/<name>.framework/Resources/CMake/ (A)\n\n <prefix>/<name>.framework/Versions/*/Resources/ (A)\n\n <prefix>/<name>.framework/Versions/*/Resources/CMake/ (A)\n\n <prefix>/<name>.app/Contents/Resources/ (A)\n\n <prefix>/<name>.app/Contents/Resources/CMake/ (A)\n\n In all cases the <name> is treated as case-insensitive and corresponds to any of the names specified (<package> or names given by NAMES). If PATH_SUFFIXES is specified the suffixes are appended to each (W) or (U) directory entry one-by-one.\n\n This set of directories is intended to work in cooperation with projects that provide configuration files in their installation trees. Directories above marked with (W) are intended for installations on Windows where the prefix may point at the top of an application's installation directory. Those marked with (U) are intended for installations on UNIX platforms where the prefix is shared by multiple packages. This is merely a convention, so all (W) and (U) directories are still searched on all platforms. Directories marked with (A) are intended for installations on Apple platforms. The cmake variables CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK and CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE determine the order of preference as specified below.\n\n The set of installation prefixes is constructed using the following steps. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified all NO_* options are enabled.\n\n 1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache variables. These are intended to be used on the command line with a -DVAR=value. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is passed.\n\n 2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables. These are intended to be set in the user's shell configuration. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.\n\n 3. Search paths specified by the HINTS option. These should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a hint provided by the location of another item already found. Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the PATHS option.\n\n 4. Search the standard system environment variables. This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed. Path entries ending in \"/bin\" or \"/sbin\" are automatically converted to their parent directories.\n\n 5. Search project build trees recently configured in a CMake GUI. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_BUILDS_PATH is passed. It is intended for the case when a user is building multiple dependent projects one after another.\n\n 6. Search paths stored in the CMake user package registry. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY is passed. Paths are stored in the registry when CMake configures a project that invokes export(PACKAGE <name>). See the export(PACKAGE) command documentation for more details.\n\n 7. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files for the current system. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is passed.\n\n 8. Search paths specified by the PATHS option. These are typically hard-coded guesses.\n\n On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or one of the following:\n\n \"FIRST\" - Try to find frameworks before standard\n\n libraries or headers. This is the default on Darwin.\n\n \"LAST\" - Try to find frameworks after standard\n\n libraries or headers.\n\n \"ONLY\" - Only try to find frameworks.\n\n \"NEVER\" - Never try to find frameworks.\n\n On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set to empty or one of the following:\n\n \"FIRST\" - Try to find application bundles before standard\n\n programs. This is the default on Darwin.\n\n \"LAST\" - Try to find application bundles after standard\n\n programs.\n\n \"ONLY\" - Only try to find application bundles.\n\n \"NEVER\" - Never try to find application bundles.\n\n The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or more directories to be prepended to all other search directories. This effectively \"re-roots\" the entire search under given locations. By default it is empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake will search there too. By default at first the directories listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted directories will be searched. The default behavior can be adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE. This behavior can be manually overridden on a per-call basis. By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted directories will be searched.\n\n The default search order is designed to be most-specific to least-specific for common use cases. Projects may override the order by simply calling the command multiple times and using the NO_* options:\n\n Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search again.\n\n See the cmake_policy() command documentation for discussion of the NO_POLICY_SCOPE option.\n• : Find the directory containing a file.\n\n This is the short-hand signature for the command that is sufficient in many cases. It is the same as find_path(<VAR> name1 [PATHS path1 path2 ...])\n\n This command is used to find a directory containing the named file. A cache entry named by <VAR> is created to store the result of this command. If the file in a directory is found the result is stored in the variable and the search will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared. If nothing is found, the result will be <VAR>-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted again the next time find_path is invoked with the same variable. The name of the file in a directory that is searched for is specified by the names listed after the NAMES argument. Additional search locations can be specified after the PATHS argument. If ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section the environment variable var will be read and converted from a system environment variable to a cmake style list of paths. For example ENV PATH would be a way to list the system path variable. The argument after DOC will be used for the documentation string in the cache. PATH_SUFFIXES specifies additional subdirectories to check below each search path.\n\n If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional paths are added to the search. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not specified, the search process is as follows:\n\n 1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache variables. These are intended to be used on the command line with a -DVAR=value. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is passed.\n\n <prefix>/include for each <prefix> in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH\n\n CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH\n\n CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH\n\n 2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables. These are intended to be set in the user's shell configuration. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.\n\n <prefix>/include for each <prefix> in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH\n\n CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH\n\n CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH\n\n 3. Search the paths specified by the HINTS option. These should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a hint provided by the location of another item already found. Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the PATHS option.\n\n 4. Search the standard system environment variables. This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an argument.\n\n 5. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files for the current system. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is passed.\n\n <prefix>/include for each <prefix> in CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH\n\n CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH\n\n CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH\n\n 6. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option or in the short-hand version of the command. These are typically hard-coded guesses.\n\n On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or one of the following:\n\n \"FIRST\" - Try to find frameworks before standard\n\n libraries or headers. This is the default on Darwin.\n\n \"LAST\" - Try to find frameworks after standard\n\n libraries or headers.\n\n \"ONLY\" - Only try to find frameworks.\n\n \"NEVER\" - Never try to find frameworks.\n\n On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set to empty or one of the following:\n\n \"FIRST\" - Try to find application bundles before standard\n\n programs. This is the default on Darwin.\n\n \"LAST\" - Try to find application bundles after standard\n\n programs.\n\n \"ONLY\" - Only try to find application bundles.\n\n \"NEVER\" - Never try to find application bundles.\n\n The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or more directories to be prepended to all other search directories.

It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake will search there too. By default at first the directories listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted directories will be searched. The default behavior can be adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE. This behavior can be manually overridden on a per-call basis. By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used.

Projects may override the order by simply calling the command multiple times and using the NO_* options:\n\n Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search again.\n\n When searching for frameworks, if the file is specified as A/b.h, then the framework search will look for A.framework/Headers/b.h. If that is found the path will be set to the path to the framework. CMake will convert this to the correct -F option to include the file.\n• : Find an executable program.\n\n This is the short-hand signature for the command that is sufficient in many cases. It is the same as find_program(<VAR> name1 [PATHS path1 path2 ...])\n\n This command is used to find a program. A cache entry named by <VAR> is created to store the result of this command. If the program is found the result is stored in the variable and the search will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared. If nothing is found, the result will be <VAR>-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted again the next time find_program is invoked with the same variable. The name of the program that is searched for is specified by the names listed after the NAMES argument. Additional search locations can be specified after the PATHS argument. If ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section the environment variable var will be read and converted from a system environment variable to a cmake style list of paths. For example ENV PATH would be a way to list the system path variable. The argument after DOC will be used for the documentation string in the cache. PATH_SUFFIXES specifies additional subdirectories to check below each search path.\n\n If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional paths are added to the search. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not specified, the search process is as follows:\n\n 1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache variables. These are intended to be used on the command line with a -DVAR=value. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is passed.\n\n <prefix>/[s]bin for each <prefix> in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH\n\n CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH\n\n CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH\n\n 2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables. These are intended to be set in the user's shell configuration. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.\n\n <prefix>/[s]bin for each <prefix> in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH\n\n CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH\n\n CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH\n\n 3. Search the paths specified by the HINTS option. These should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a hint provided by the location of another item already found. Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the PATHS option.\n\n 4. Search the standard system environment variables. This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an argument.\n\n 5. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files for the current system. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is passed.\n\n <prefix>/[s]bin for each <prefix> in CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH\n\n CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH\n\n CMAKE_SYSTEM_APPBUNDLE_PATH\n\n 6. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option or in the short-hand version of the command. These are typically hard-coded guesses.\n\n On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or one of the following:\n\n \"FIRST\" - Try to find frameworks before standard\n\n libraries or headers. This is the default on Darwin.\n\n \"LAST\" - Try to find frameworks after standard\n\n libraries or headers.\n\n \"ONLY\" - Only try to find frameworks.\n\n \"NEVER\" - Never try to find frameworks.\n\n On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set to empty or one of the following:\n\n \"FIRST\" - Try to find application bundles before standard\n\n programs. This is the default on Darwin.\n\n \"LAST\" - Try to find application bundles after standard\n\n programs.\n\n \"ONLY\" - Only try to find application bundles.\n\n \"NEVER\" - Never try to find application bundles.\n\n The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or more directories to be prepended to all other search directories. This effectively \"re-roots\" the entire search under given locations. By default it is empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake will search there too.

Projects may override the order by simply calling the command multiple times and using the NO_* options:\n\n Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search again.\n• : Create FLTK user interfaces Wrappers.\n\n Produce .h and .cxx files for all the .fl and .fld files listed. The resulting .h and .cxx files will be added to a variable named resultingLibraryName_FLTK_UI_SRCS which should be added to your library.\n• : Evaluate a group of commands for each value in a list.\n\n All commands between foreach and the matching endforeach are recorded without being invoked. Once the endforeach is evaluated, the recorded list of commands is invoked once for each argument listed in the original foreach command. Before each iteration of the loop \"${loop_var}\" will be set as a variable with the current value in the list.\n\n Foreach can also iterate over a generated range of numbers. There are three types of this iteration:\n\n * When specifying single number, the range will have elements 0 to \"total\".\n\n * When specifying two numbers, the range will have elements from the first number to the second number.\n\n * The third optional number is the increment used to iterate from the first number to the second number.\n\n Iterates over a precise list of items. The LISTS option names list-valued variables to be traversed, including empty elements (an empty string is a zero-length list). The ITEMS option ends argument parsing and includes all arguments following it in the iteration.\n• : Start recording a function for later invocation as a command.\n\n Define a function named <name> that takes arguments named arg1 arg2 arg3 (...). Commands listed after function, but before the matching endfunction, are not invoked until the function is invoked. When it is invoked, the commands recorded in the function are first modified by replacing formal parameters (${arg1}) with the arguments passed, and then invoked as normal commands. In addition to referencing the formal parameters you can reference the variable ARGC which will be set to the number of arguments passed into the function as well as ARGV0 ARGV1 ARGV2 ... which will have the actual values of the arguments passed in. This facilitates creating functions with optional arguments. Additionally ARGV holds the list of all arguments given to the function and ARGN holds the list of argument past the last expected argument.\n\n See the cmake_policy() command documentation for the behavior of policies inside functions.\n• : Get a property of the CMake instance.\n\n Get a property from the CMake instance. The value of the property is stored in the variable VAR. If the property is not found, CMake will report an error. Some supported properties include: VARIABLES, CACHE_VARIABLES, COMMANDS, MACROS, and COMPONENTS.\n• : Get a property of DIRECTORY scope.\n\n Store a property of directory scope in the named variable. If the property is not defined the empty-string is returned. The DIRECTORY argument specifies another directory from which to retrieve the property value. The specified directory must have already been traversed by CMake.\n\n Get a variable definition from a directory. This form is useful to get a variable definition from another directory.\n• : Get a specific component of a full filename.\n\n Set VarName to be the path (PATH), file name (NAME), file extension (EXT), file name without extension (NAME_WE) of FileName, the full path (ABSOLUTE), or the full path with all symlinks resolved (REALPATH). Note that the path is converted to Unix slashes format and has no trailing slashes. The longest file extension is always considered. If the optional CACHE argument is specified, the result variable is added to the cache.\n\n The program in FileName will be found in the system search path or left as a full path. If PROGRAM_ARGS is present with PROGRAM, then any command-line arguments present in the FileName string are split from the program name and stored in ArgVar. This is used to separate a program name from its arguments in a command line string.\n• : Get a property.\n\n Get one property from one object in a scope. The first argument specifies the variable in which to store the result. The second argument determines the scope from which to get the property. It must be one of the following:\n\n GLOBAL scope is unique and does not accept a name.\n\n DIRECTORY scope defaults to the current directory but another directory (already processed by CMake) may be named by full or relative path.\n\n TARGET scope must name one existing target.\n\n SOURCE scope must name one source file.\n\n TEST scope must name one existing test.\n\n CACHE scope must name one cache entry.\n\n VARIABLE scope is unique and does not accept a name.\n\n The required PROPERTY option is immediately followed by the name of the property to get. If the property is not set an empty value is returned. If the SET option is given the variable is set to a boolean value indicating whether the property has been set. If the DEFINED option is given the variable is set to a boolean value indicating whether the property has been defined such as with define_property. If BRIEF_DOCS or FULL_DOCS is given then the variable is set to a string containing documentation for the requested property. If documentation is requested for a property that has not been defined NOTFOUND is returned.\n• : Get a property for a source file.\n\n Get a property from a source file. The value of the property is stored in the variable VAR. If the property is not found, VAR will be set to \"NOTFOUND\". Use set_source_files_properties to set property values. Source file properties usually control how the file is built. One property that is always there is LOCATION\n• : Get a property from a target.\n\n Get a property from a target. The value of the property is stored in the variable VAR. If the property is not found, VAR will be set to \"NOTFOUND\". Use set_target_properties to set property values. Properties are usually used to control how a target is built, but some query the target instead. This command can get properties for any target so far created. The targets do not need to be in the current CMakeLists.txt file.\n• : Get a property of the test.\n\n Get a property from the Test. The value of the property is stored in the variable VAR. If the property is not found, CMake will report an error. For a list of standard properties you can type cmake --help-property-list\n• : Conditionally execute a group of commands.\n\n Evaluates the given expression. If the result is true, the commands in the THEN section are invoked. Otherwise, the commands in the else section are invoked. The elseif and else sections are optional. You may have multiple elseif clauses. Note that the expression in the else and endif clause is optional. Long expressions can be used and there is a traditional order of precedence. Parenthetical expressions are evaluated first followed by unary operators such as EXISTS, COMMAND, and DEFINED. Then any EQUAL, LESS, GREATER, STRLESS, STRGREATER, STREQUAL, MATCHES will be evaluated. Then NOT operators and finally AND, OR operators will be evaluated. Possible expressions are:\n\n True if the constant is 1, ON, YES, TRUE, Y, or a non-zero number. False if the constant is 0, OFF, NO, FALSE, N, IGNORE, \"\", or ends in the suffix '-NOTFOUND'. Named boolean constants are case-insensitive.\n\n True if the variable's value is not a false constant.\n\n True if the expression is not true.\n\n True if both expressions would be considered true individually.\n\n True if either expression would be considered true individually.\n\n True if the given name is a command, macro or function that can be invoked.\n\n True if the given name is an existing policy (of the form CMP<NNNN>).\n\n True if the given name is an existing target, built or imported.\n\n True if the named file or directory exists. Behavior is well-defined only for full paths.\n\n True if file1 is newer than file2 or if one of the two files doesn't exist. Behavior is well-defined only for full paths.\n\n True if the given name is a directory. Behavior is well-defined only for full paths.\n\n True if the given name is a symbolic link. Behavior is well-defined only for full paths.\n\n True if the given path is an absolute path.\n\n True if the given string or variable's value matches the given regular expression.\n\n True if the given string or variable's value is a valid number and the inequality or equality is true.\n\n True if the given string or variable's value is lexicographically less (or greater, or equal) than the string or variable on the right.\n\n True if the given variable is defined. It does not matter if the variable is true or false just if it has been set.\n\n The expressions inside the parenthesis are evaluated first and then the remaining expression is evaluated as in the previous examples. Where there are nested parenthesis the innermost are evaluated as part of evaluating the expression that contains them.\n\n The if statement was written fairly early in CMake's history and it has some convenience features that are worth covering. The if statement reduces operations until there is a single remaining value, at that point if the case insensitive value is: ON, 1, YES, TRUE, Y it returns true, if it is OFF, 0, NO, FALSE, N, NOTFOUND, *-NOTFOUND, IGNORE it will return false. \n\n This is fairly reasonable. The convenience feature that sometimes throws new authors is how CMake handles values that do not match the true or false list. Those values are treated as variables and are dereferenced even though they do not have the required ${} syntax. This means that if you write\n\n CMake will treat it as if you wrote \n\n CMake will conveniently treat it as \n\n The later is really the correct way to write it, but the former will work as well. Only some operations in the if statement have this special handling of arguments. The specific details follow: \n\n 1) The left hand argument to MATCHES is first checked to see if it is a defined variable, if so the variable's value is used, otherwise the original value is used. \n\n 2) If the left hand argument to MATCHES is missing it returns false without error \n\n 3) Both left and right hand arguments to LESS GREATER EQUAL are independently tested to see if they are defined variables, if so their defined values are used otherwise the original value is used. \n\n 4) Both left and right hand arguments to STRLESS STREQUAL STRGREATER are independently tested to see if they are defined variables, if so their defined values are used otherwise the original value is used. \n\n 5) Both left and right hand argumemnts to VERSION_LESS VERSION_EQUAL VERSION_GREATER are independently tested to see if they are defined variables, if so their defined values are used otherwise the original value is used. \n\n 6) The right hand argument to NOT is tested to see if it is a boolean constant, if so the value is used, otherwise it is assumed to be a variable and it is dereferenced. \n\n 7) The left and right hand arguments to AND OR are independently tested to see if they are boolean constants, if so they are used as such, otherwise they are assumed to be variables and are dereferenced.\n• : Read CMake listfile code from the given file.\n\n Reads CMake listfile code from the given file. Commands in the file are processed immediately as if they were written in place of the include command. If OPTIONAL is present, then no error is raised if the file does not exist. If RESULT_VARIABLE is given the variable will be set to the full filename which has been included or NOTFOUND if it failed.\n\n If a module is specified instead of a file, the file with name <modulename>.cmake is searched in the CMAKE_MODULE_PATH.\n\n See the cmake_policy() command documentation for discussion of the NO_POLICY_SCOPE option.\n• : Add include directories to the build.\n\n Add the given directories to those searched by the compiler for include files. By default the directories are appended onto the current list of directories. This default behavior can be changed by setting CMAKE_include_directories_BEFORE to ON. By using BEFORE or AFTER you can select between appending and prepending, independent from the default. If the SYSTEM option is given the compiler will be told that the directories are meant as system include directories on some platforms.\n• : Include an external Microsoft project file in a workspace.\n\n Includes an external Microsoft project in the generated workspace file. Currently does nothing on UNIX. This will create a target named INCLUDE_EXTERNAL_MSPROJECT_[projectname]. This can be used in the add_dependencies command to make things depend on the external project.\n• : Set the regular expression used for dependency checking.\n\n Set the regular expressions used in dependency checking. Only files matching regex_match will be traced as dependencies. Only files matching regex_complain will generate warnings if they cannot be found (standard header paths are not searched). The defaults are:\n• : Specify rules to run at install time.\n\n This command generates installation rules for a project. Rules specified by calls to this command within a source directory are executed in order during installation. The order across directories is not defined.\n\n There are multiple signatures for this command. Some of them define installation properties for files and targets. Properties common to multiple signatures are covered here but they are valid only for signatures that specify them.\n\n DESTINATION arguments specify the directory on disk to which a file will be installed. If a full path (with a leading slash or drive letter) is given it is used directly. If a relative path is given it is interpreted relative to the value of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.\n\n PERMISSIONS arguments specify permissions for installed files. Valid permissions are OWNER_READ, OWNER_WRITE, OWNER_EXECUTE, GROUP_READ, GROUP_WRITE, GROUP_EXECUTE, WORLD_READ, WORLD_WRITE, WORLD_EXECUTE, SETUID, and SETGID. Permissions that do not make sense on certain platforms are ignored on those platforms.\n\n The CONFIGURATIONS argument specifies a list of build configurations for which the install rule applies (Debug, Release, etc.).\n\n The COMPONENT argument specifies an installation component name with which the install rule is associated, such as \"runtime\" or \"development\". During component-specific installation only install rules associated with the given component name will be executed. During a full installation all components are installed.\n\n The RENAME argument specifies a name for an installed file that may be different from the original file. Renaming is allowed only when a single file is installed by the command.\n\n The OPTIONAL argument specifies that it is not an error if the file to be installed does not exist. \n\n The TARGETS form specifies rules for installing targets from a project. There are five kinds of target files that may be installed: ARCHIVE, LIBRARY, RUNTIME, FRAMEWORK, and BUNDLE. Executables are treated as RUNTIME targets, except that those marked with the MACOSX_BUNDLE property are treated as BUNDLE targets on OS X. Static libraries are always treated as ARCHIVE targets. Module libraries are always treated as LIBRARY targets. For non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as LIBRARY targets, except that those marked with the FRAMEWORK property are treated as FRAMEWORK targets on OS X. For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is treated as a RUNTIME target and the corresponding import library is treated as an ARCHIVE target. All Windows-based systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms. The ARCHIVE, LIBRARY, RUNTIME, and FRAMEWORK arguments change the type of target to which the subsequent properties apply. If none is given the installation properties apply to all target types. If only one is given then only targets of that type will be installed (which can be used to install just a DLL or just an import library).\n\n The PRIVATE_HEADER, PUBLIC_HEADER, and RESOURCE arguments cause subsequent properties to be applied to installing a FRAMEWORK shared library target's associated files on non-Apple platforms. Rules defined by these arguments are ignored on Apple platforms because the associated files are installed into the appropriate locations inside the framework folder. See documentation of the PRIVATE_HEADER, PUBLIC_HEADER, and RESOURCE target properties for details.\n\n Either NAMELINK_ONLY or NAMELINK_SKIP may be specified as a LIBRARY option. On some platforms a versioned shared library has a symbolic link such as\n\n where \"lib<name>.so.1\" is the soname of the library and \"lib<name>.so\" is a \"namelink\" allowing linkers to find the library when given \"-l<name>\". The NAMELINK_ONLY option causes installation of only the namelink when a library target is installed. The NAMELINK_SKIP option causes installation of library files other than the namelink when a library target is installed. When neither option is given both portions are installed. On platforms where versioned shared libraries do not have namelinks or when a library is not versioned the NAMELINK_SKIP option installs the library and the NAMELINK_ONLY option installs nothing. See the VERSION and SOVERSION target properties for details on creating versioned shared libraries.\n\n One or more groups of properties may be specified in a single call to the TARGETS form of this command. A target may be installed more than once to different locations. Consider hypothetical targets \"myExe\", \"mySharedLib\", and \"myStaticLib\". The code\n\n will install myExe to <prefix>/bin and myStaticLib to <prefix>/lib/static. On non-DLL platforms mySharedLib will be installed to <prefix>/lib and /some/full/path. On DLL platforms the mySharedLib DLL will be installed to <prefix>/bin and /some/full/path and its import library will be installed to <prefix>/lib/static and /some/full/path. On non-DLL platforms mySharedLib will be installed to <prefix>/lib and /some/full/path.\n\n The EXPORT option associates the installed target files with an export called <export-name>. It must appear before any RUNTIME, LIBRARY, or ARCHIVE options. See documentation of the install(EXPORT ...) signature below for details.\n\n Installing a target with EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL set to true has undefined behavior.\n\n The FILES form specifies rules for installing files for a project. File names given as relative paths are interpreted with respect to the current source directory. Files installed by this form are by default given permissions OWNER_WRITE, OWNER_READ, GROUP_READ, and WORLD_READ if no PERMISSIONS argument is given.\n\n The PROGRAMS form is identical to the FILES form except that the default permissions for the installed file also include OWNER_EXECUTE, GROUP_EXECUTE, and WORLD_EXECUTE. This form is intended to install programs that are not targets, such as shell scripts. Use the TARGETS form to install targets built within the project.\n\n The DIRECTORY form installs contents of one or more directories to a given destination. The directory structure is copied verbatim to the destination. The last component of each directory name is appended to the destination directory but a trailing slash may be used to avoid this because it leaves the last component empty. Directory names given as relative paths are interpreted with respect to the current source directory. If no input directory names are given the destination directory will be created but nothing will be installed into it. The FILE_PERMISSIONS and DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS options specify permissions given to files and directories in the destination. If USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS is specified and FILE_PERMISSIONS is not, file permissions will be copied from the source directory structure. If no permissions are specified files will be given the default permissions specified in the FILES form of the command, and the directories will be given the default permissions specified in the PROGRAMS form of the command.\n\n Installation of directories may be controlled with fine granularity using the PATTERN or REGEX options. These \"match\" options specify a globbing pattern or regular expression to match directories or files encountered within input directories. They may be used to apply certain options (see below) to a subset of the files and directories encountered. The full path to each input file or directory (with forward slashes) is matched against the expression. A PATTERN will match only complete file names: the portion of the full path matching the pattern must occur at the end of the file name and be preceded by a slash. A REGEX will match any portion of the full path but it may use '/' and '$' to simulate the PATTERN behavior. By default all files and directories are installed whether or not they are matched. The FILES_MATCHING option may be given before the first match option to disable installation of files (but not directories) not matched by any expression. For example, the code\n\n will extract and install header files from a source tree.\n\n Some options may follow a PATTERN or REGEX expression and are applied only to files or directories matching them. The EXCLUDE option will skip the matched file or directory. The PERMISSIONS option overrides the permissions setting for the matched file or directory. For example the code\n\n will install the icons directory to share/myproj/icons and the scripts directory to share/myproj. The icons will get default file permissions, the scripts will be given specific permissions, and any CVS directories will be excluded.\n\n The SCRIPT form will invoke the given CMake script files during installation. If the script file name is a relative path it will be interpreted with respect to the current source directory. The CODE form will invoke the given CMake code during installation. Code is specified as a single argument inside a double-quoted string. For example, the code\n\n The EXPORT form generates and installs a CMake file containing code to import targets from the installation tree into another project. Target installations are associated with the export <export-name> using the EXPORT option of the install(TARGETS ...) signature documented above. The NAMESPACE option will prepend <namespace> to the target names as they are written to the import file. By default the generated file will be called <export-name>.cmake but the FILE option may be used to specify a different name. The value given to the FILE option must be a file name with the \".cmake\" extension. If a CONFIGURATIONS option is given then the file will only be installed when one of the named configurations is installed. Additionally, the generated import file will reference only the matching target configurations. If a COMPONENT option is specified that does not match that given to the targets associated with <export-name> the behavior is undefined. If a library target is included in the export but a target to which it links is not included the behavior is unspecified.\n\n The EXPORT form is useful to help outside projects use targets built and installed by the current project. For example, the code\n\n will install the executable myexe to <prefix>/bin and code to import it in the file \"<prefix>/lib/myproj/myproj.cmake\". An outside project may load this file with the include command and reference the myexe executable from the installation tree using the imported target name mp_myexe as if the target were built in its own tree.\n\n NOTE: This command supercedes the INSTALL_TARGETS command and the target properties PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT. It also replaces the FILES forms of the INSTALL_FILES and INSTALL_PROGRAMS commands. The processing order of these install rules relative to those generated by INSTALL_TARGETS, INSTALL_FILES, and INSTALL_PROGRAMS commands is not defined.\n• : Specify directories in which the linker will look for libraries.\n\n Specify the paths in which the linker should search for libraries. The command will apply only to targets created after it is called. For historical reasons, relative paths given to this command are passed to the linker unchanged (unlike many CMake commands which interpret them relative to the current source directory).\n• : List operations.\n\n list(LENGTH <list> <output variable>)\n\n list(GET <list> <element index> [<element index> ...]\n\n <output variable>)\n\n list(APPEND <list> <element> [<element> ...])\n\n list(FIND <list> <value> <output variable>)\n\n list(INSERT <list> <element_index> <element> [<element> ...])\n\n list(REMOVE_ITEM <list> <value> [<value> ...])\n\n list(REMOVE_AT <list> <index> [<index> ...])\n\n list(REMOVE_DUPLICATES <list>)\n\n list(REVERSE <list>)\n\n list(SORT <list>)\n\n GET will return list of elements specified by indices from the list.\n\n APPEND will append elements to the list.\n\n FIND will return the index of the element specified in the list or -1 if it wasn't found.\n\n INSERT will insert elements to the list to the specified location.\n\n REMOVE_AT and REMOVE_ITEM will remove items from the list. The difference is that REMOVE_ITEM will remove the given items, while REMOVE_AT will remove the items at the given indices.\n\n REMOVE_DUPLICATES will remove duplicated items in the list.\n\n REVERSE reverses the contents of the list in-place.\n\n NOTES: A list in cmake is a ; separated group of strings. To create a list the set command can be used. For example, set(var a b c d e) creates a list with a;b;c;d;e, and set(var \"a b c d e\") creates a string or a list with one item in it.\n\n When specifying index values, if <element index> is 0 or greater, it is indexed from the beginning of the list, with 0 representing the first list element. If <element index> is -1 or lesser, it is indexed from the end of the list, with -1 representing the last list element. Be careful when counting with negative indices: they do not start from 0. -0 is equivalent to 0, the first list element.\n• : Load in the values from another project's CMake cache.\n\n Read the cache and store the requested entries in variables with their name prefixed with the given prefix. This only reads the values, and does not create entries in the local project's cache.\n\n Load in the values from another cache and store them in the local project's cache as internal entries. This is useful for a project that depends on another project built in a different tree. EXCLUDE option can be used to provide a list of entries to be excluded. INCLUDE_INTERNALS can be used to provide a list of internal entries to be included. Normally, no internal entries are brought in. Use of this form of the command is strongly discouraged, but it is provided for backward compatibility.\n• : Load a command into a running CMake.\n\n The given locations are searched for a library whose name is cmCOMMAND_NAME. If found, it is loaded as a module and the command is added to the set of available CMake commands. Usually, TRY_COMPILE is used before this command to compile the module. If the command is successfully loaded a variable named\n\n will be set to the full path of the module that was loaded. Otherwise the variable will not be set.\n• : Start recording a macro for later invocation as a command.\n\n Define a macro named <name> that takes arguments named arg1 arg2 arg3 (...). Commands listed after macro, but before the matching endmacro, are not invoked until the macro is invoked. When it is invoked, the commands recorded in the macro are first modified by replacing formal parameters (${arg1}) with the arguments passed, and then invoked as normal commands. In addition to referencing the formal parameters you can reference the values ${ARGC} which will be set to the number of arguments passed into the function as well as ${ARGV0} ${ARGV1} ${ARGV2} ... which will have the actual values of the arguments passed in. This facilitates creating macros with optional arguments. Additionally ${ARGV} holds the list of all arguments given to the macro and ${ARGN} holds the list of argument past the last expected argument. Note that the parameters to a macro and values such as ARGN are not variables in the usual CMake sense. They are string replacements much like the c preprocessor would do with a macro. If you want true CMake variables you should look at the function command.\n\n See the cmake_policy() command documentation for the behavior of policies inside macros.\n• : Mark cmake cached variables as advanced.\n\n Mark the named cached variables as advanced. An advanced variable will not be displayed in any of the cmake GUIs unless the show advanced option is on. If CLEAR is the first argument advanced variables are changed back to unadvanced. If FORCE is the first argument, then the variable is made advanced. If neither FORCE nor CLEAR is specified, new values will be marked as advanced, but if the variable already has an advanced/non-advanced state, it will not be changed.\n\n It does nothing in script mode.\n• : Mathematical expressions.\n\n EXPR evaluates mathematical expression and return result in the output variable. Example mathematical expression is '5 * ( 10 + 13 )'. Supported operators are + - * / % | & ^ ~ << >> * / %. They have the same meaning as they do in c code.\n• : Display a message to the user.\n\n The optional keyword determines the type of message:\n\n (none) = Important information\n\n STATUS = Incidental information\n\n WARNING = CMake Warning, continue processing\n\n AUTHOR_WARNING = CMake Warning (dev), continue processing\n\n SEND_ERROR = CMake Error, continue but skip generation\n\n FATAL_ERROR = CMake Error, stop all processing\n\n The CMake command-line tool displays STATUS messages on stdout and all other message types on stderr. The CMake GUI displays all messages in its log area. The interactive dialogs (ccmake and CMakeSetup) show STATUS messages one at a time on a status line and other messages in interactive pop-up boxes.\n\n CMake Warning and Error message text displays using a simple markup language. Non-indented text is formatted in line-wrapped paragraphs delimited by newlines. Indented text is considered pre-formatted.\n• : Provides an option that the user can optionally select.\n\n Provide an option for the user to select as ON or OFF. If no initial value is provided, OFF is used.\n• : Output a list of required source files for a specified source file.\n\n Outputs a list of all the source files that are required by the specified srcfile. This list is written into outputfile. This is similar to writing out the dependencies for srcfile except that it jumps from .h files into .cxx, .c and .cpp files if possible.\n• : Set a name for the entire project.\n\n Sets the name of the project. Additionally this sets the variables <projectName>_BINARY_DIR and <projectName>_SOURCE_DIR to the respective values.\n\n Optionally you can specify which languages your project supports. Example languages are CXX (i.e. C++), C, Fortran, etc. By default C and CXX are enabled. E.g. if you do not have a C++ compiler, you can disable the check for it by explicitely listing the languages you want to support, e.g. C. By using the special language \"NONE\" all checks for any language can be disabled.\n• : Create Qt Wrappers.\n\n Produce moc files for all the .h files listed in the SourceLists. The moc files will be added to the library using the DestName source list.\n• : Create Qt user interfaces Wrappers.\n\n Produce .h and .cxx files for all the .ui files listed in the SourceLists. The .h files will be added to the library using the HeadersDestNamesource list. The .cxx files will be added to the library using the SourcesDestNamesource list.\n• : Removes -D define flags added by add_definitions.\n\n Removes flags (added by add_definitions) from the compiler command line for sources in the current directory and below.\n• : Return from a file, directory or function.\n\n Returns from a file, directory or function. When this command is encountered in an included file (via include() or find_package()), it causes processing of the current file to stop and control is returned to the including file. If it is encountered in a file which is not included by another file, e.g. a CMakeLists.txt, control is returned to the parent directory if there is one. If return is called in a function, control is returned to the caller of the function. Note that a macro is not a function and does not handle return like a function does.\n• : Parse space-separated arguments into a semicolon-separated list.\n\n Parses a unix- or windows-style command-line string \"<args>\" and stores a semicolon-separated list of the arguments in <var>. The entire command line must be given in one \"<args>\" argument.\n\n The UNIX_COMMAND mode separates arguments by unquoted whitespace. It recognizes both single-quote and double-quote pairs. A backslash escapes the next literal character (\\\" is \"); there are no special escapes (\n\n is just n).\n\n The WINDOWS_COMMAND mode parses a windows command-line using the same syntax the runtime library uses to construct argv at startup. It separates arguments by whitespace that is not double-quoted. Backslashes are literal unless they precede double-quotes. See the MSDN article \"Parsing C Command-Line Arguments\" for details.\n\n Convert the value of VARIABLE to a semi-colon separated list. All spaces are replaced with ';'. This helps with generating command lines.\n• : Set a CMAKE variable to a given value.\n\n Within CMake sets <variable> to the value <value>. <value> is expanded before <variable> is set to it. If CACHE is present, then the <variable> is put in the cache. <type> and <docstring> are then required. <type> is used by the CMake GUI to choose a widget with which the user sets a value. The value for <type> may be one of\n\n FILEPATH = File chooser dialog.\n\n PATH = Directory chooser dialog.\n\n STRING = Arbitrary string.\n\n BOOL = Boolean ON/OFF checkbox.\n\n INTERNAL = No GUI entry (used for persistent variables).\n\n If <type> is INTERNAL, then the <value> is always written into the cache, replacing any values existing in the cache. If it is not a cache variable, then this always writes into the current makefile. The FORCE option will overwrite the cache value removing any changes by the user.\n\n If PARENT_SCOPE is present, the variable will be set in the scope above the current scope. Each new directory or function creates a new scope. This command will set the value of a variable into the parent directory or calling function (whichever is applicable to the case at hand).\n\n If <value> is not specified then the variable is removed instead of set. See also: the unset() command.\n\n In this case <variable> is set to a semicolon separated list of values.\n\n <variable> can be an environment variable such as:\n\n in which case the environment variable will be set.\n• : Set a property of the directory.\n\n Set a property for the current directory and subdirectories. If the property is not found, CMake will report an error. The properties include: INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, LINK_DIRECTORIES, INCLUDE_REGULAR_EXPRESSION, and ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES. ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES is a list of files that will be cleaned as a part of \"make clean\" stage.\n• : Set a named property in a given scope.\n\n Set one property on zero or more objects of a scope. The first argument determines the scope in which the property is set. It must be one of the following:\n\n GLOBAL scope is unique and does not accept a name.\n\n DIRECTORY scope defaults to the current directory but another directory (already processed by CMake) may be named by full or relative path.\n\n TARGET scope may name zero or more existing targets.\n\n SOURCE scope may name zero or more source files.\n\n TEST scope may name zero or more existing tests.\n\n CACHE scope must name zero or more cache existing entries.\n\n The required PROPERTY option is immediately followed by the name of the property to set. Remaining arguments are used to compose the property value in the form of a semicolon-separated list. If the APPEND option is given the list is appended to any existing property value.\n• : Source files can have properties that affect how they are built.\n\n Set properties on a file. The syntax for the command is to list all the files you want to change, and then provide the values you want to set next. You can make up your own properties as well. The following are used by CMake. The ABSTRACT flag (boolean) is used by some class wrapping commands. If WRAP_EXCLUDE (boolean) is true then many wrapping commands will ignore this file. If GENERATED (boolean) is true then it is not an error if this source file does not exist when it is added to a target. Obviously, it must be created (presumably by a custom command) before the target is built. If the HEADER_FILE_ONLY (boolean) property is true then the file is not compiled. This is useful if you want to add extra non build files to an IDE. OBJECT_DEPENDS (string) adds dependencies to the object file. COMPILE_FLAGS (string) is passed to the compiler as additional command line arguments when the source file is compiled. LANGUAGE (string) CXX|C will change the default compiler used to compile the source file. The languages used need to be enabled in the PROJECT command. If SYMBOLIC (boolean) is set to true the build system will be informed that the source file is not actually created on disk but instead used as a symbolic name for a build rule.\n• : Targets can have properties that affect how they are built.\n\n Set properties on a target. The syntax for the command is to list all the files you want to change, and then provide the values you want to set next. You can use any prop value pair you want and extract it later with the GET_TARGET_PROPERTY command.\n\n Properties that affect the name of a target's output file are as follows. The PREFIX and SUFFIX properties override the default target name prefix (such as \"lib\") and suffix (such as \".so\"). IMPORT_PREFIX and IMPORT_SUFFIX are the equivalent properties for the import library corresponding to a DLL (for SHARED library targets). OUTPUT_NAME sets the real name of a target when it is built and can be used to help create two targets of the same name even though CMake requires unique logical target names. There is also a <CONFIG>_OUTPUT_NAME that can set the output name on a per-configuration basis. <CONFIG>_POSTFIX sets a postfix for the real name of the target when it is built under the configuration named by <CONFIG> (in upper-case, such as \"DEBUG_POSTFIX\"). The value of this property is initialized when the target is created to the value of the variable CMAKE_<CONFIG>_POSTFIX (except for executable targets because earlier CMake versions which did not use this variable for executables).\n\n The LINK_FLAGS property can be used to add extra flags to the link step of a target. LINK_FLAGS_<CONFIG> will add to the configuration <CONFIG>, for example, DEBUG, RELEASE, MINSIZEREL, RELWITHDEBINFO. DEFINE_SYMBOL sets the name of the preprocessor symbol defined when compiling sources in a shared library. If not set here then it is set to target_EXPORTS by default (with some substitutions if the target is not a valid C identifier). This is useful for headers to know whether they are being included from inside their library our outside to properly setup dllexport/dllimport decorations. The COMPILE_FLAGS property sets additional compiler flags used to build sources within the target. It may also be used to pass additional preprocessor definitions.\n\n The LINKER_LANGUAGE property is used to change the tool used to link an executable or shared library. The default is set the language to match the files in the library. CXX and C are common values for this property.\n\n For shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used to specify the build version and api version respectively. When building or installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports symlinks and the linker supports so-names. If only one of both is specified the missing is assumed to have the same version number. For executables VERSION can be used to specify the build version. When building or installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports symlinks. For shared libraries and executables on Windows the VERSION attribute is parsed to extract a \"major.minor\" version number. These numbers are used as the image version of the binary. \n\n There are a few properties used to specify RPATH rules. INSTALL_RPATH is a semicolon-separated list specifying the rpath to use in installed targets (for platforms that support it). INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH is a boolean that if set to true will append directories in the linker search path and outside the project to the INSTALL_RPATH. SKIP_BUILD_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to skip automatic generation of an rpath allowing the target to run from the build tree. BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to link the target in the build tree with the INSTALL_RPATH. This takes precedence over SKIP_BUILD_RPATH and avoids the need for relinking before installation. INSTALL_NAME_DIR is a string specifying the directory portion of the \"install_name\" field of shared libraries on Mac OSX to use in the installed targets. When the target is created the values of the variables CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH, CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH, CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH, CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH, and CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR are used to initialize these properties.\n\n PROJECT_LABEL can be used to change the name of the target in an IDE like visual studio. VS_KEYWORD can be set to change the visual studio keyword, for example QT integration works better if this is set to Qt4VSv1.0.\n\n VS_SCC_PROJECTNAME, VS_SCC_LOCALPATH, VS_SCC_PROVIDER can be set to add support for source control bindings in a Visual Studio project file.\n\n The PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT properties are the old way to specify CMake scripts to run before and after installing a target. They are used only when the old INSTALL_TARGETS command is used to install the target. Use the INSTALL command instead.\n\n The EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD property is used by the visual studio generators. If it is set to 1 the target will not be part of the default build when you select \"Build Solution\".\n• : Set a property of the tests.\n\n Set a property for the tests. If the property is not found, CMake will report an error. The properties include:\n\n WILL_FAIL: If set to true, this will invert the pass/fail flag of the test.\n\n PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION: If set, the test output will be checked against the specified regular expressions and at least one of the regular expressions has to match, otherwise the test will fail.\n\n FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION: If set, if the output will match to one of specified regular expressions, the test will fail.\n\n Both PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION and FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION expect a list of regular expressions.\n\n TIMEOUT: Setting this will limit the test runtime to the number of seconds specified.\n• : Set the given variable to the name of the computer.\n• : Define a grouping for sources in the makefile.\n\n Defines a group into which sources will be placed in project files. This is mainly used to setup file tabs in Visual Studio. Any file whose name is listed or matches the regular expression will be placed in this group. If a file matches multiple groups, the LAST group that explicitly lists the file will be favored, if any. If no group explicitly lists the file, the LAST group whose regular expression matches the file will be favored.\n\n The name of the group may contain backslashes to specify subgroups:\n\n For backwards compatibility, this command is also supports the format:\n• : String operations.\n\n REGEX MATCH will match the regular expression once and store the match in the output variable.\n\n REGEX MATCHALL will match the regular expression as many times as possible and store the matches in the output variable as a list.\n\n REGEX REPLACE will match the regular expression as many times as possible and substitute the replacement expression for the match in the output. The replace expression may refer to paren-delimited subexpressions of the match using \\1, \\2, ..., \\9. Note that two backslashes (\\\\1) are required in CMake code to get a backslash through argument parsing.\n\n REPLACE will replace all occurrences of match_string in the input with replace_string and store the result in the output.\n\n COMPARE EQUAL/NOTEQUAL/LESS/GREATER will compare the strings and store true or false in the output variable.\n\n ASCII will convert all numbers into corresponding ASCII characters.\n\n SUBSTRING will return a substring of a given string.\n\n STRIP will return a substring of a given string with leading and trailing spaces removed.\n\n RANDOM will return a random string of given length consisting of characters from the given alphabet. Default length is 5 characters and default alphabet is all numbers and upper and lower case letters. If an integer RANDOM_SEED is given, its value will be used to seed the random number generator.\n\n The following characters have special meaning in regular expressions:\n\n ^ Matches at beginning of a line\n\n $ Matches at end of a line\n\n . Matches any single character\n\n [ ] Matches any character(s) inside the brackets\n\n [^ ] Matches any character(s) not inside the brackets\n\n - Matches any character in range on either side of a dash\n\n * Matches preceding pattern zero or more times\n\n + Matches preceding pattern one or more times\n\n ? Matches preceding pattern zero or once only\n\n | Matches a pattern on either side of the |\n\n () Saves a matched subexpression, which can be referenced \n\n in the REGEX REPLACE operation. Additionally it is saved\n\n by all regular expression-related commands, including \n\n e.g. if( MATCHES ), in the variables CMAKE_MATCH_(0..9).\n• : Link a target to given libraries.\n\n Specify libraries or flags to use when linking a given target. If a library name matches that of another target in the project a dependency will automatically be added in the build system to make sure the library being linked is up-to-date before the target links. Item names starting with '-', but not '-l' or '-framework', are treated as linker flags.\n\n A \"debug\", \"optimized\", or \"general\" keyword indicates that the library immediately following it is to be used only for the corresponding build configuration. The \"debug\" keyword corresponds to the Debug configuration (or to configurations named in the DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS global property if it is set). The \"optimized\" keyword corresponds to all other configurations. The \"general\" keyword corresponds to all configurations, and is purely optional (assumed if omitted). Higher granularity may be achieved for per-configuration rules by creating and linking to IMPORTED library targets. See the IMPORTED mode of the add_library command for more information. \n\n Library dependencies are transitive by default. When this target is linked into another target then the libraries linked to this target will appear on the link line for the other target too. See the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES target property to override the set of transitive link dependencies for a target.\n\n The LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES mode appends the libraries to the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES and its per-configuration equivalent target properties instead of using them for linking. Libraries specified as \"debug\" are appended to the the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_DEBUG property (or to the properties corresponding to configurations listed in the DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS global property if it is set). Libraries specified as \"optimized\" are appended to the the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES property. Libraries specified as \"general\" (or without any keyword) are treated as if specified for both \"debug\" and \"optimized\".\n\n The library dependency graph is normally acyclic (a DAG), but in the case of mutually-dependent STATIC libraries CMake allows the graph to contain cycles (strongly connected components). When another target links to one of the libraries CMake repeats the entire connected component. For example, the code\n\n links 'main' to 'A B A B'. (While one repetition is usually sufficient, pathological object file and symbol arrangements can require more. One may handle such cases by manually repeating the component in the last target_link_libraries call. However, if two archives are really so interdependent they should probably be combined into a single archive.)\n• : Try compiling some code.\n\n Try compiling a program. In this form, srcdir should contain a complete CMake project with a CMakeLists.txt file and all sources. The bindir and srcdir will not be deleted after this command is run. If <target name> is specified then build just that target otherwise the all or ALL_BUILD target is built.\n\n Try compiling a srcfile. In this case, the user need only supply a source file. CMake will create the appropriate CMakeLists.txt file to build the source. If COPY_FILE is used, the compiled file will be copied to the given file.\n\n In this version all files in bindir/CMakeFiles/CMakeTmp, will be cleaned automatically, for debugging a --debug-trycompile can be passed to cmake to avoid the clean. Some extra flags that can be included are, INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, LINK_DIRECTORIES, and LINK_LIBRARIES. COMPILE_DEFINITIONS are -Ddefinition that will be passed to the compile line. try_compile creates a CMakeList.txt file on the fly that looks like this:\n\n In both versions of the command, if OUTPUT_VARIABLE is specified, then the output from the build process is stored in the given variable. Return the success or failure in RESULT_VAR. CMAKE_FLAGS can be used to pass -DVAR:TYPE=VALUE flags to the cmake that is run during the build.\n• : Try compiling and then running some code.\n\n Try compiling a srcfile. Return TRUE or FALSE for success or failure in COMPILE_RESULT_VAR. Then if the compile succeeded, run the executable and return its exit code in RUN_RESULT_VAR. If the executable was built, but failed to run, then RUN_RESULT_VAR will be set to FAILED_TO_RUN. COMPILE_OUTPUT_VARIABLE specifies the variable where the output from the compile step goes. RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE specifies the variable where the output from the running executable goes.\n\n For compatibility reasons OUTPUT_VARIABLE is still supported, which gives you the output from the compile and run step combined.\n\n When cross compiling, the executable compiled in the first step usually cannot be run on the build host. try_run() checks the CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING variable to detect whether CMake is in crosscompiling mode. If that's the case, it will still try to compile the executable, but it will not try to run the executable. Instead it will create cache variables which must be filled by the user or by presetting them in some CMake script file to the values the executable would have produced if it would have been run on its actual target platform. These variables are RUN_RESULT_VAR (explanation see above) and if RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE (or OUTPUT_VARIABLE) was used, an additional cache variable RUN_RESULT_VAR__COMPILE_RESULT_VAR__TRYRUN_OUTPUT.This is intended to hold stdout and stderr from the executable.\n\n In order to make cross compiling your project easier, use try_run only if really required. If you use try_run, use RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE (or OUTPUT_VARIABLE) only if really required. Using them will require that when crosscompiling, the cache variables will have to be set manually to the output of the executable. You can also \"guard\" the calls to try_run with if(CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING) and provide an easy-to-preset alternative for this case.\n• : Unset a variable, cache variable, or environment variable.\n\n Removes the specified variable causing it to become undefined. If CACHE is present then the variable is removed from the cache instead of the current scope.\n\n <variable> can be an environment variable such as:\n\n in which case the variable will be removed from the current environment.\n• : Watch the CMake variable for change.\n\n If the specified variable changes, the message will be printed about the variable being changed. If the command is specified, the command will be executed. The command will receive the following arguments: COMMAND(<variable> <access> <value> <current list file> <stack>)\n• : Evaluate a group of commands while a condition is true\n\n All commands between while and the matching endwhile are recorded without being invoked. Once the endwhile is evaluated, the recorded list of commands is invoked as long as the condition is true. The condition is evaluated using the same logic as the if command.\n\nThis is the documentation for the properties supported by CMake. Properties can have different scopes. They can either be assigned to a source file, a directory, a target or globally to CMake. By modifying the values of properties the behaviour of the build system can be customized.\n• : Allow duplicate custom targets to be created.\n\n Normally CMake requires that all targets built in a project have globally unique logical names (see policy CMP0002). This is necessary to generate meaningful project file names in Xcode and VS IDE generators. It also allows the target names to be referenced unambiguously.\n\n Makefile generators are capable of supporting duplicate custom target names. For projects that care only about Makefile generators and do not wish to support Xcode or VS IDE generators, one may set this property to true to allow duplicate custom targets. The property allows multiple add_custom_target command calls in different directories to specify the same target name. However, setting this property will cause non-Makefile generators to produce an error and refuse to generate the project.\n• : Specify which configurations are for debugging.\n\n The value must be a semi-colon separated list of configuration names. Currently this property is used only by the target_link_libraries command (see its documentation for details). Additional uses may be defined in the future. \n\n This property must be set at the top level of the project and before the first target_link_libraries command invocation. If any entry in the list does not match a valid configuration for the project the behavior is undefined.\n• : List of features which are disabled during the CMake run.\n\n List of features which are disabled during the CMake run. Be default it contains the names of all packages which were not found. This is determined using the <NAME>_FOUND variables. Packages which are searched QUIET are not listed. A project can add its own features to this list.This property is used by the macros in FeatureSummary.cmake.\n• : List of features which are enabled during the CMake run.\n\n List of features which are enabled during the CMake run. Be default it contains the names of all packages which were found. This is determined using the <NAME>_FOUND variables. Packages which are searched QUIET are not listed. A project can add its own features to this list.This property is used by the macros in FeatureSummary.cmake.\n• : Read-only property that contains the list of currently enabled languages\n\n Set to list of currently enabled languages.\n• : Whether FIND_LIBRARY should automatically search lib64 directories.\n\n FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS is a boolean specifying whether the FIND_LIBRARY command should automatically search the lib64 variant of directories called lib in the search path when building 64-bit binaries.\n• : Whether FIND_LIBRARY should find OpenBSD-style shared libraries.\n\n This property is a boolean specifying whether the FIND_LIBRARY command should find shared libraries with OpenBSD-style versioned extension: \".so.<major>.<minor>\". The property is set to true on OpenBSD and false on other platforms.\n• : Enable global target dependency graph debug mode.\n\n CMake automatically analyzes the global inter-target dependency graph at the beginning of native build system generation. This property causes it to display details of its analysis to stderr.\n• : Disallow global target dependency graph cycles.\n\n CMake automatically analyzes the global inter-target dependency graph at the beginning of native build system generation. It reports an error if the dependency graph contains a cycle that does not consist of all STATIC library targets. This property tells CMake to disallow all cycles completely, even among static libraries.\n• : Read-only property that is true during a try-compile configuration.\n• : List of packages which were found during the CMake run.\n\n List of packages which were found during the CMake run. Whether a package has been found is determined using the <NAME>_FOUND variables.\n• : List of packages which were not found during the CMake run.\n\n List of packages which were not found during the CMake run. Whether a package has been found is determined using the <NAME>_FOUND variables.\n• : If set, report any undefined properties to this file.\n\n If this property is set to a filename then when CMake runs it will report any properties or variables that were accessed but not defined into the filename specified in this property.\n• : Specify a launcher for compile rules.\n\n Makefile generators prefix compiler commands with the given launcher command line. This is intended to allow launchers to intercept build problems with high granularity. Non-Makefile generators currently ignore this property.\n• : Specify a launcher for custom rules.\n\n Makefile generators prefix custom commands with the given launcher command line. This is intended to allow launchers to intercept build problems with high granularity. Non-Makefile generators currently ignore this property.\n• : Specify a launcher for link rules.\n\n Makefile generators prefix link and archive commands with the given launcher command line. This is intended to allow launchers to intercept build problems with high granularity. Non-Makefile generators currently ignore this property.\n• : Specify whether to report a message for each make rule.\n\n This property specifies whether Makefile generators should add a progress message describing what each build rule does. If the property is not set the default is ON. Set the property to OFF to disable granular messages and report only as each target completes. This is intended to allow scripted builds to avoid the build time cost of detailed reports. If a CMAKE_RULE_MESSAGES cache entry exists its value initializes the value of this property. Non-Makefile generators currently ignore this property.\n• : Set if shared libraries may be named like archives.\n\n On AIX shared libraries may be named \"lib<name>.a\". This property is set to true on such platforms.\n• : Does the target platform support shared libraries.\n\n TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS is a boolean specifying whether the target platform supports shared libraries. Basically all current general general purpose OS do so, the exception are usually embedded systems with no or special OSs.\n• : Internal property\n\n Used to detect compiler changes, Do not set.\n• : Additional files to clean during the make clean stage.\n\n A list of files that will be cleaned as a part of the \"make clean\" stage.\n• : List of cache variables available in the current directory.\n\n This read-only property specifies the list of CMake cache variables currently defined. It is intended for debugging purposes.\n• : Should the output of custom commands be left.\n\n If this is true then the outputs of custom commands for this directory will not be removed during the \"make clean\" stage.\n• : Preprocessor definitions for compiling a directory's sources.\n\n The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to a semicolon-separated list of preprocessor definitions using the syntax VAR or VAR=value. Function-style definitions are not supported. CMake will automatically escape the value correctly for the native build system (note that CMake language syntax may require escapes to specify some values). This property may be set on a per-configuration basis using the name COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG> where <CONFIG> is an upper-case name (ex. \"COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG\"). This property will be initialized in each directory by its value in the directory's parent.\n\n CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported by the native build tool. The VS6 IDE does not support definition values with spaces (but NMake does).\n\n Dislaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping certain values. CMake has work-arounds for many cases but some values may just not be possible to pass correctly. If a value does not seem to be escaped correctly, do not attempt to work-around the problem by adding escape sequences to the value. Your work-around may break in a future version of CMake that has improved escape support. Instead consider defining the macro in a (configured) header file. Then report the limitation.\n• : Per-configuration preprocessor definitions in a directory.\n\n This is the configuration-specific version of COMPILE_DEFINITIONS. This property will be initialized in each directory by its value in the directory's parent.\n• : For CMake 2.4 compatibility only. Use COMPILE_DEFINITIONS instead.\n\n This read-only property specifies the list of flags given so far to the add_definitions command. It is intended for debugging purposes. Use the COMPILE_DEFINITIONS instead.\n• : Exclude the directory from the all target of its parent.\n\n A property on a directory that indicates if its targets are excluded from the default build target. If it is not, then with a Makefile for example typing make will cause the targets to be built. The same concept applies to the default build of other generators.\n• : Specify #include line transforms for dependencies in a directory.\n\n This property specifies rules to transform macro-like #include lines during implicit dependency scanning of C and C++ source files. The list of rules must be semicolon-separated with each entry of the form \"A_MACRO(%)=value-with-%\" (the % must be literal). During dependency scanning occurrences of A_MACRO(...) on #include lines will be replaced by the value given with the macro argument substituted for '%'. For example, the entry\n\n will convert lines of the form\n\n allowing the dependency to be followed.\n\n This property applies to sources in all targets within a directory. The property value is initialized in each directory by its value in the directory's parent.\n• : List of preprocessor include file search directories.\n\n This read-only property specifies the list of directories given so far to the include_directories command. It is intended for debugging purposes.\n• : Include file scanning regular expression.\n\n This read-only property specifies the regular expression used during dependency scanning to match include files that should be followed. See the include_regular_expression command.\n• : Enable interprocedural optimization for targets in a directory.\n\n If set to true, enables interprocedural optimizations if they are known to be supported by the compiler.\n• : Per-configuration interprocedural optimization for a directory.\n\n This is a per-configuration version of INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION. If set, this property overrides the generic property for the named configuration.\n• : List of linker search directories.\n\n This read-only property specifies the list of directories given so far to the link_directories command. It is intended for debugging purposes.\n• : The current stack of listfiles being processed.\n\n This property is mainly useful when trying to debug errors in your CMake scripts. It returns a list of what list files are currently being processed, in order. So if one listfile does an INCLUDE command then that is effectively pushing the included listfile onto the stack.\n• : List of macro commands available in the current directory.\n\n This read-only property specifies the list of CMake macros currently defined. It is intended for debugging purposes. See the macro command.\n• : Source directory that added current subdirectory.\n\n This read-only property specifies the source directory that added the current source directory as a subdirectory of the build. In the top-level directory the value is the empty-string.\n• : Specify a launcher for compile rules.\n\n See the global property of the same name for details. This overrides the global property for a directory.\n• : Specify a launcher for custom rules.\n\n See the global property of the same name for details. This overrides the global property for a directory.\n• : Specify a launcher for link rules.\n\n See the global property of the same name for details. This overrides the global property for a directory.\n• : A cmake file that will be included when ctest is run.\n\n If you specify TEST_INCLUDE_FILE, that file will be included and processed when ctest is run on the directory.\n• : List of variables defined in the current directory.\n\n This read-only property specifies the list of CMake variables currently defined. It is intended for debugging purposes.\n• : Old per-configuration target file base name.\n\n This is a configuration-specific version of OUTPUT_NAME. Use OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG> instead.\n• : Postfix to append to the target file name for configuration <CONFIG>.\n\n When building with configuration <CONFIG> the value of this property is appended to the target file name built on disk. For non-executable targets, this property is initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_<CONFIG>_POSTFIX if it is set when a target is created. This property is ignored on the Mac for Frameworks and App Bundles.\n• : Output directory in which to build ARCHIVE target files.\n\n This property specifies the directory into which archive target files should be built. Multi-configuration generators (VS, Xcode) append a per-configuration subdirectory to the specified directory. There are three kinds of target files that may be built: archive, library, and runtime. Executables are always treated as runtime targets. Static libraries are always treated as archive targets. Module libraries are always treated as library targets. For non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library targets. For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is treated as a runtime target and the corresponding import library is treated as an archive target. All Windows-based systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms. This property is initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is created.\n• : Per-configuration output directory for ARCHIVE target files.\n\n This is a per-configuration version of ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, but multi-configuration generators (VS, Xcode) do NOT append a per-configuration subdirectory to the specified directory. This property is initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG> if it is set when a target is created.\n• : Output name for ARCHIVE target files.\n\n This property specifies the base name for archive target files. It overrides OUTPUT_NAME and OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG> properties. There are three kinds of target files that may be built: archive, library, and runtime. Executables are always treated as runtime targets. Static libraries are always treated as archive targets. Module libraries are always treated as library targets. For non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library targets. For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is treated as a runtime target and the corresponding import library is treated as an archive target. All Windows-based systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms.\n• : Per-configuration output name for ARCHIVE target files.\n\n This is the configuration-specific version of ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME.\n• : Should build tree targets have install tree rpaths.\n\n BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to link the target in the build tree with the INSTALL_RPATH. This takes precedence over SKIP_BUILD_RPATH and avoids the need for relinking before installation. This property is initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH if it is set when a target is created.\n• : Preprocessor definitions for compiling a target's sources.\n\n The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to a semicolon-separated list of preprocessor definitions using the syntax VAR or VAR=value. Function-style definitions are not supported. CMake will automatically escape the value correctly for the native build system (note that CMake language syntax may require escapes to specify some values). This property may be set on a per-configuration basis using the name COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG> where <CONFIG> is an upper-case name (ex. \"COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG\").\n\n CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported by the native build tool. The VS6 IDE does not support definition values with spaces (but NMake does).\n\n Dislaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping certain values. CMake has work-arounds for many cases but some values may just not be possible to pass correctly. If a value does not seem to be escaped correctly, do not attempt to work-around the problem by adding escape sequences to the value. Your work-around may break in a future version of CMake that has improved escape support. Instead consider defining the macro in a (configured) header file. Then report the limitation.\n• : Per-configuration preprocessor definitions on a target.\n\n This is the configuration-specific version of COMPILE_DEFINITIONS.\n• : Additional flags to use when compiling this target's sources.\n\n The COMPILE_FLAGS property sets additional compiler flags used to build sources within the target. Use COMPILE_DEFINITIONS to pass additional preprocessor definitions.\n• : See target property <CONFIG>_POSTFIX.\n\n This property is a special case of the more-general <CONFIG>_POSTFIX property for the DEBUG configuration.\n• : Define a symbol when compiling this target's sources.\n\n DEFINE_SYMBOL sets the name of the preprocessor symbol defined when compiling sources in a shared library. If not set here then it is set to target_EXPORTS by default (with some substitutions if the target is not a valid C identifier). This is useful for headers to know whether they are being included from inside their library our outside to properly setup dllexport/dllimport decorations.\n• : Specify whether an executable exports symbols for loadable modules.\n\n Normally an executable does not export any symbols because it is the final program. It is possible for an executable to export symbols to be used by loadable modules. When this property is set to true CMake will allow other targets to \"link\" to the executable with the TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES command. On all platforms a target-level dependency on the executable is created for targets that link to it. For non-DLL platforms the link rule is simply ignored since the dynamic loader will automatically bind symbols when the module is loaded. For DLL platforms an import library will be created for the exported symbols and then used for linking. All Windows-based systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms.\n• : Exclude the target from the all target.\n\n A property on a target that indicates if the target is excluded from the default build target. If it is not, then with a Makefile for example typing make will cause this target to be built. The same concept applies to the default build of other generators. Installing a target with EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL set to true has undefined behavior.\n• : A message to be displayed when the target is built.\n\n A message to display on some generators (such as makefiles) when the target is built.\n• : This target is a framework on the Mac.\n\n If a shared library target has this property set to true it will be built as a framework when built on the mac. It will have the directory structure required for a framework and will be suitable to be used with the -framework option\n• : Specify output directory for Fortran modules provided by the target.\n\n If the target contains Fortran source files that provide modules and the compiler supports a module output directory this specifies the directory in which the modules will be placed. When this property is not set the modules will be placed in the build directory corresponding to the target's source directory. If the variable CMAKE_Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY is set when a target is created its value is used to initialize this property.\n• : Generator's file for this target.\n\n An internal property used by some generators to record the name of project or dsp file associated with this target.\n• : Link the target using the C++ linker tool (obselete).\n\n This is equivalent to setting the LINKER_LANGUAGE property to CXX. See that property's documentation for details.\n• : Specify #include line transforms for dependencies in a target.\n\n This property specifies rules to transform macro-like #include lines during implicit dependency scanning of C and C++ source files. The list of rules must be semicolon-separated with each entry of the form \"A_MACRO(%)=value-with-%\" (the % must be literal). During dependency scanning occurrences of A_MACRO(...) on #include lines will be replaced by the value given with the macro argument substituted for '%'. For example, the entry\n\n will convert lines of the form\n\n allowing the dependency to be followed.\n\n This property applies to sources in the target on which it is set.\n• : Read-only indication of whether a target is IMPORTED.\n\n The boolean value of this property is true for targets created with the IMPORTED option to add_executable or add_library. It is false for targets built within the project.\n• : Configurations provided for an IMPORTED target.\n\n Lists configuration names available for an IMPORTED target. The names correspond to configurations defined in the project from which the target is imported. If the importing project uses a different set of configurations the names may be mapped using the MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG> property. Ignored for non-imported targets.\n• : Full path to the import library for an IMPORTED target.\n\n Specifies the location of the \".lib\" part of a windows DLL. Ignored for non-imported targets.\n• : Per-configuration version of IMPORTED_IMPLIB property.\n\n This property is used when loading settings for the <CONFIG> configuration of an imported target. Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from which the target is imported.\n• : Dependent shared libraries of an imported shared library.\n\n Shared libraries may be linked to other shared libraries as part of their implementation. On some platforms the linker searches for the dependent libraries of shared libraries they are including in the link. This property lists the dependent shared libraries of an imported library. The list should be disjoint from the list of interface libraries in the IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES property. On platforms requiring dependent shared libraries to be found at link time CMake uses this list to add appropriate files or paths to the link command line. Ignored for non-imported targets.\n• : Per-configuration version of IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES.\n\n This property is used when loading settings for the <CONFIG> configuration of an imported target. Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from which the target is imported. If set, this property completely overrides the generic property for the named configuration.\n• : Languages compiled into an IMPORTED static library.\n\n Lists languages of soure files compiled to produce a STATIC IMPORTED library (such as \"C\" or \"CXX\"). CMake accounts for these languages when computing how to link a target to the imported library. For example, when a C executable links to an imported C++ static library CMake chooses the C++ linker to satisfy language runtime dependencies of the static library. \n\n This property is ignored for targets that are not STATIC libraries. This property is ignored for non-imported targets.\n• : Per-configuration version of IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES.\n\n This property is used when loading settings for the <CONFIG> configuration of an imported target. Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from which the target is imported. If set, this property completely overrides the generic property for the named configuration.\n• : Transitive link interface of an IMPORTED target.\n\n Lists libraries whose interface is included when an IMPORTED library target is linked to another target. The libraries will be included on the link line for the target. Unlike the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES property, this property applies to all imported target types, including STATIC libraries. This property is ignored for non-imported targets.\n• : Per-configuration version of IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES.\n\n This property is used when loading settings for the <CONFIG> configuration of an imported target. Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from which the target is imported. If set, this property completely overrides the generic property for the named configuration.\n• : Repetition count for cycles of IMPORTED static libraries.\n\n This is LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY for IMPORTED targets.\n• : Per-configuration repetition count for cycles of IMPORTED archives.\n\n This is the configuration-specific version of IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY. If set, this property completely overrides the generic property for the named configuration.\n• : Full path to the main file on disk for an IMPORTED target.\n\n Specifies the location of an IMPORTED target file on disk. For executables this is the location of the executable file. For bundles on OS X this is the location of the executable file inside Contents/MacOS under the application bundle folder. For static libraries and modules this is the location of the library or module. For shared libraries on non-DLL platforms this is the location of the shared library. For frameworks on OS X this is the location of the library file symlink just inside the framework folder. For DLLs this is the location of the \".dll\" part of the library. For UNKNOWN libraries this is the location of the file to be linked. Ignored for non-imported targets.\n• : Per-configuration version of IMPORTED_LOCATION property.\n\n This property is used when loading settings for the <CONFIG> configuration of an imported target. Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from which the target is imported.\n• : The \"soname\" of an IMPORTED target of shared library type.\n\n Specifies the \"soname\" embedded in an imported shared library. This is meaningful only on platforms supporting the feature. Ignored for non-imported targets.\n• : Per-configuration version of IMPORTED_SONAME property.\n\n This property is used when loading settings for the <CONFIG> configuration of an imported target. Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from which the target is imported.\n• : What comes before the import library name.\n\n Similar to the target property PREFIX, but used for import libraries (typically corresponding to a DLL) instead of regular libraries. A target property that can be set to override the prefix (such as \"lib\") on an import library name.\n• : What comes after the import library name.\n\n Similar to the target property SUFFIX, but used for import libraries (typically corresponding to a DLL) instead of regular libraries. A target property that can be set to override the suffix (such as \".lib\") on an import library name.\n• : Mac OSX directory name for installed targets.\n\n INSTALL_NAME_DIR is a string specifying the directory portion of the \"install_name\" field of shared libraries on Mac OSX to use in the installed targets.\n• : The rpath to use for installed targets.\n\n A semicolon-separated list specifying the rpath to use in installed targets (for platforms that support it). This property is initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH if it is set when a target is created.\n• : Add paths to linker search and installed rpath.\n\n INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH is a boolean that if set to true will append directories in the linker search path and outside the project to the INSTALL_RPATH. This property is initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH if it is set when a target is created.\n• : Enable interprocedural optimization for a target.\n\n If set to true, enables interprocedural optimizations if they are known to be supported by the compiler.\n• : Per-configuration interprocedural optimization for a target.\n\n This is a per-configuration version of INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION. If set, this property overrides the generic property for the named configuration.\n• : Specify a list of text labels associated with a target.\n• : Output directory in which to build LIBRARY target files.\n\n This property specifies the directory into which library target files should be built. Multi-configuration generators (VS, Xcode) append a per-configuration subdirectory to the specified directory. There are three kinds of target files that may be built: archive, library, and runtime. Executables are always treated as runtime targets. Static libraries are always treated as archive targets. Module libraries are always treated as library targets. For non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library targets. For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is treated as a runtime target and the corresponding import library is treated as an archive target. All Windows-based systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms. This property is initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is created.\n• : Per-configuration output directory for LIBRARY target files.\n\n This is a per-configuration version of LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, but multi-configuration generators (VS, Xcode) do NOT append a per-configuration subdirectory to the specified directory. This property is initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG> if it is set when a target is created.\n• : Output name for LIBRARY target files.\n\n This property specifies the base name for library target files. It overrides OUTPUT_NAME and OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG> properties. There are three kinds of target files that may be built: archive, library, and runtime. Executables are always treated as runtime targets. Static libraries are always treated as archive targets. Module libraries are always treated as library targets. For non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library targets. For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is treated as a runtime target and the corresponding import library is treated as an archive target. All Windows-based systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms.\n• : Per-configuration output name for LIBRARY target files.\n\n This is the configuration-specific version of LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME.\n• : Specifies language whose compiler will invoke the linker.\n\n For executables, shared libraries, and modules, this sets the language whose compiler is used to link the target (such as \"C\" or \"CXX\"). A typical value for an executable is the language of the source file providing the program entry point (main). If not set, the language with the highest linker preference value is the default. See documentation of CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE variables.\n• : Additional flags to use when linking this target.\n\n The LINK_FLAGS property can be used to add extra flags to the link step of a target. LINK_FLAGS_<CONFIG> will add to the configuration <CONFIG>, for example, DEBUG, RELEASE, MINSIZEREL, RELWITHDEBINFO.\n• : Per-configuration linker flags for a target.\n\n This is the configuration-specific version of LINK_FLAGS.\n• : List public interface libraries for a shared library or executable.\n\n By default linking to a shared library target transitively links to targets with which the library itself was linked. For an executable with exports (see the ENABLE_EXPORTS property) no default transitive link dependencies are used. This property replaces the default transitive link dependencies with an explict list. When the target is linked into another target the libraries listed (and recursively their link interface libraries) will be provided to the other target also. If the list is empty then no transitive link dependencies will be incorporated when this target is linked into another target even if the default set is non-empty. This property is ignored for STATIC libraries.\n• : Per-configuration list of public interface libraries for a target.\n\n This is the configuration-specific version of LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES. If set, this property completely overrides the generic property for the named configuration.\n• : Repetition count for STATIC libraries with cyclic dependencies.\n\n When linking to a STATIC library target with cyclic dependencies the linker may need to scan more than once through the archives in the strongly connected component of the dependency graph. CMake by default constructs the link line so that the linker will scan through the component at least twice. This property specifies the minimum number of scans if it is larger than the default. CMake uses the largest value specified by any target in a component.\n• : Per-configuration repetition count for cycles of STATIC libraries.\n\n This is the configuration-specific version of LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY. If set, this property completely overrides the generic property for the named configuration.\n• : End a link line such that static system libraries are used.\n\n Some linkers support switches such as -Bstatic and -Bdynamic to determine whether to use static or shared libraries for -lXXX options. CMake uses these options to set the link type for libraries whose full paths are not known or (in some cases) are in implicit link directories for the platform. By default the linker search type is left at -Bdynamic by the end of the library list. This property switches the final linker search type to -Bstatic.\n• : Read-only location of a target on disk.\n\n For an imported target, this read-only property returns the value of the LOCATION_<CONFIG> property for an unspecified configuration <CONFIG> provided by the target.\n\n For a non-imported target, this property is provided for compatibility with CMake 2.4 and below. It was meant to get the location of an executable target's output file for use in add_custom_command. The path may contain a build-system-specific portion that is replaced at build time with the configuration getting built (such as \"$(ConfigurationName)\" in VS). In CMake 2.6 and above add_custom_command automatically recognizes a target name in its COMMAND and DEPENDS options and computes the target location. Therefore this property is not needed for creating custom commands.\n• : Read-only property providing a target location on disk.\n\n A read-only property that indicates where a target's main file is located on disk for the configuration <CONFIG>. The property is defined only for library and executable targets. An imported target may provide a set of configurations different from that of the importing project. By default CMake looks for an exact-match but otherwise uses an arbitrary available configuration. Use the MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG> property to map imported configurations explicitly.\n• : Build an executable as an application bundle on Mac OS X.\n\n When this property is set to true the executable when built on Mac OS X will be created as an application bundle. This makes it a GUI executable that can be launched from the Finder. See the MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST target property for information about creation of the Info.plist file for the application bundle.\n• : Specify a custom Info.plist template for a Mac OS X App Bundle.\n\n An executable target with MACOSX_BUNDLE enabled will be built as an application bundle on Mac OS X. By default its Info.plist file is created by configuring a template called MacOSXBundleInfo.plist.in located in the CMAKE_MODULE_PATH. This property specifies an alternative template file name which may be a full path.\n\n The following target properties may be set to specify content to be configured into the file:\n\n CMake variables of the same name may be set to affect all targets in a directory that do not have each specific property set. If a custom Info.plist is specified by this property it may of course hard-code all the settings instead of using the target properties.\n• : Specify a custom Info.plist template for a Mac OS X Framework.\n\n An library target with FRAMEWORK enabled will be built as a framework on Mac OS X. By default its Info.plist file is created by configuring a template called MacOSXFrameworkInfo.plist.in located in the CMAKE_MODULE_PATH. This property specifies an alternative template file name which may be a full path.\n\n The following target properties may be set to specify content to be configured into the file:\n\n CMake variables of the same name may be set to affect all targets in a directory that do not have each specific property set. If a custom Info.plist is specified by this property it may of course hard-code all the settings instead of using the target properties.\n• : Map from project configuration to IMPORTED target's configuration.\n\n List configurations of an imported target that may be used for the current project's <CONFIG> configuration. Targets imported from another project may not provide the same set of configuration names available in the current project. Setting this property tells CMake what imported configurations are suitable for use when building the <CONFIG> configuration. The first configuration in the list found to be provided by the imported target is selected. If no matching configurations are available the imported target is considered to be not found. This property is ignored for non-imported targets.\n• : Target specific architectures for OS X.\n\n The OSX_ARCHITECTURES property sets the target binary architecture for targets on OS X. This property is initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES if it is set when a target is created. Use OSX_ARCHITECTURES_<CONFIG> to set the binary architectures on a per-configuration basis. <CONFIG> is an upper-case name (ex: \"OSX_ARCHITECTURES_DEBUG\").\n• : Per-configuration OS X binary architectures for a target.\n\n This property is the configuration-specific version of OSX_ARCHITECTURES.\n• : Output name for target files.\n\n This sets the base name for output files created for an executable or library target. If not set, the logical target name is used by default.\n• : Per-configuration target file base name.\n\n This is the configuration-specific version of OUTPUT_NAME.\n• : Deprecated install support.\n\n The PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT properties are the old way to specify CMake scripts to run before and after installing a target. They are used only when the old INSTALL_TARGETS command is used to install the target. Use the INSTALL command instead.\n• : What comes before the library name.\n\n A target property that can be set to override the prefix (such as \"lib\") on a library name.\n• : Deprecated install support.\n\n The PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT properties are the old way to specify CMake scripts to run before and after installing a target. They are used only when the old INSTALL_TARGETS command is used to install the target. Use the INSTALL command instead.\n• : Specify private header files in a FRAMEWORK shared library target.\n\n Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK property generate frameworks on OS X and normal shared libraries on other platforms. This property may be set to a list of header files to be placed in the PrivateHeaders directory inside the framework folder. On non-Apple platforms these headers may be installed using the PRIVATE_HEADER option to the install(TARGETS) command.\n• : Change the name of a target in an IDE.\n\n Can be used to change the name of the target in an IDE like visual stuido.\n• : Specify public header files in a FRAMEWORK shared library target.\n\n Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK property generate frameworks on OS X and normal shared libraries on other platforms. This property may be set to a list of header files to be placed in the Headers directory inside the framework folder. On non-Apple platforms these headers may be installed using the PUBLIC_HEADER option to the install(TARGETS) command.\n• : Specify resource files in a FRAMEWORK shared library target.\n\n Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK property generate frameworks on OS X and normal shared libraries on other platforms. This property may be set to a list of files to be placed in the Resources directory inside the framework folder. On non-Apple platforms these files may be installed using the RESOURCE option to the install(TARGETS) command.\n• : Specify a launcher for compile rules.\n\n See the global property of the same name for details. This overrides the global and directory property for a target.\n• : Specify a launcher for custom rules.\n\n See the global property of the same name for details. This overrides the global and directory property for a target.\n• : Specify a launcher for link rules.\n\n See the global property of the same name for details. This overrides the global and directory property for a target.\n• : Output directory in which to build RUNTIME target files.\n\n This property specifies the directory into which runtime target files should be built. Multi-configuration generators (VS, Xcode) append a per-configuration subdirectory to the specified directory. There are three kinds of target files that may be built: archive, library, and runtime. Executables are always treated as runtime targets. Static libraries are always treated as archive targets. Module libraries are always treated as library targets. For non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library targets. For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is treated as a runtime target and the corresponding import library is treated as an archive target. All Windows-based systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms. This property is initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is created.\n• : Per-configuration output directory for RUNTIME target files.\n\n This is a per-configuration version of RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, but multi-configuration generators (VS, Xcode) do NOT append a per-configuration subdirectory to the specified directory. This property is initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG> if it is set when a target is created.\n• : Output name for RUNTIME target files.\n\n This property specifies the base name for runtime target files. It overrides OUTPUT_NAME and OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG> properties. There are three kinds of target files that may be built: archive, library, and runtime. Executables are always treated as runtime targets. Static libraries are always treated as archive targets. Module libraries are always treated as library targets. For non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library targets. For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is treated as a runtime target and the corresponding import library is treated as an archive target. All Windows-based systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms.\n• : Per-configuration output name for RUNTIME target files.\n\n This is the configuration-specific version of RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME.\n• : Should rpaths be used for the build tree.\n\n SKIP_BUILD_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to skip automatic generation of an rpath allowing the target to run from the build tree. This property is initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH if it is set when a target is created.\n• : Source names specified for a target.\n\n Read-only list of sources specified for a target. The names returned are suitable for passing to the set_source_files_properties command.\n• : What version number is this target.\n\n For shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used to specify the build version and api version respectively. When building or installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports symlinks and the linker supports so-names. If only one of both is specified the missing is assumed to have the same version number. For shared libraries and executables on Windows the VERSION attribute is parsed to extract a \"major.minor\" version number. These numbers are used as the image version of the binary.\n• : Extra flags to use when linking static libraries.\n\n Extra flags to use when linking a static library.\n• : What comes after the library name.\n\n A target property that can be set to override the suffix (such as \".so\") on a library name.\n• : The type of the target.\n\n This read-only property can be used to test the type of the given target. It will be one of STATIC_LIBRARY, MODULE_LIBRARY, SHARED_LIBRARY, EXECUTABLE or one of the internal target types.\n• : What version number is this target.\n\n For shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used to specify the build version and api version respectively. When building or installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports symlinks and the linker supports so-names. If only one of both is specified the missing is assumed to have the same version number. For executables VERSION can be used to specify the build version. When building or installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports symlinks. For shared libraries and executables on Windows the VERSION attribute is parsed to extract a \"major.minor\" version number. These numbers are used as the image version of the binary.\n• : Visual Studio project keyword.\n\n Can be set to change the visual studio keyword, for example QT integration works better if this is set to Qt4VSv1.0.\n• : Visual Studio Source Code Control Provider.\n\n Can be set to change the visual studio source code control local path property.\n• : Visual Studio Source Code Control Project.\n\n Can be set to change the visual studio source code control project name property.\n• : Visual Studio Source Code Control Provider.\n\n Can be set to change the visual studio source code control provider property.\n• : Build an executable with a WinMain entry point on windows.\n\n When this property is set to true the executable when linked on Windows will be created with a WinMain() entry point instead of of just main().This makes it a GUI executable instead of a console application. See the CMAKE_MFC_FLAG variable documentation to configure use of MFC for WinMain executables.\n• : Set Xcode target attributes directly.\n\n Tell the Xcode generator to set '<an-attribute>' to a given value in the generated Xcode project. Ignored on other generators.\n• : Attach a list of files to a dashboard submission.\n\n Set this property to a list of files that will be encoded and submitted to the dashboard as an addition to the test result.\n• : Attach a list of files to a dashboard submission if the test fails.\n\n Same as ATTACHED_FILES, but these files will only be included if the test does not pass.\n• : Set this to a floating point value. Tests in a test set will be run in descending order of cost.\n\n This property describes the cost of a test. You can explicitly set this value; tests with higher COST values will run first.\n• : Specifies that this test should only be run after the specified list of tests.\n\n Set this to a list of tests that must finish before this test is run.\n• : Specify environment variables that should be defined for running a test.\n\n If set to a list of environment variables and values of the form MYVAR=value those environment variables will be defined while running the test. The environment is restored to its previous state after the test is done.\n• : If the output matches this regular expression the test will fail.\n\n If set, if the output matches one of specified regular expressions, the test will fail.For example: PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION \"[^a-z]Error;ERROR;Failed\"\n• : Specify a list of text labels associated with a test.\n\n The list is reported in dashboard submissions.\n• : Specify a CDASH measurement and value to be reported for a test.\n\n If set to a name then that name will be reported to CDASH as a named measurement with a value of 1. You may also specify a value by setting MEASUREMENT to \"measurement=value\".\n• : The output must match this regular expression for the test to pass.\n\n If set, the test output will be checked against the specified regular expressions and at least one of the regular expressions has to match, otherwise the test will fail.\n• : How many process slots this test requires\n\n Denotes the number of processors that this test will require. This is typically used for MPI tests, and should be used in conjunction with the ctest_test PARALLEL_LEVEL option.\n• : List of files required to run the test.\n\n If set to a list of files, the test will not be run unless all of the files exist.\n• : Do not run this test in parallel with any other test.\n\n Use this option in conjunction with the ctest_test PARALLEL_LEVEL option to specify that this test should not be run in parallel with any other tests.\n• : How many seconds to allow for this test.\n\n This property if set will limit a test to not take more than the specified number of seconds to run. If it exceeds that the test process will be killed and ctest will move to the next test. This setting takes precedence over CTEST_TESTING_TIMEOUT.\n• : If set to true, this will invert the pass/fail flag of the test.\n\n This property can be used for tests that are expected to fail and return a non zero return code.\n• : Is this source file an abstract class.\n\n A property on a source file that indicates if the source file represents a class that is abstract. This only makes sense for languages that have a notion of an abstract class and it is only used by some tools that wrap classes into other languages.\n• : Preprocessor definitions for compiling a source file.\n\n The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to a semicolon-separated list of preprocessor definitions using the syntax VAR or VAR=value. Function-style definitions are not supported. CMake will automatically escape the value correctly for the native build system (note that CMake language syntax may require escapes to specify some values). This property may be set on a per-configuration basis using the name COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG> where <CONFIG> is an upper-case name (ex. \"COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG\").\n\n CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported by the native build tool. The VS6 IDE does not support definition values with spaces (but NMake does). Xcode does not support per-configuration definitions on source files.\n\n Dislaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping certain values. CMake has work-arounds for many cases but some values may just not be possible to pass correctly. If a value does not seem to be escaped correctly, do not attempt to work-around the problem by adding escape sequences to the value. Your work-around may break in a future version of CMake that has improved escape support. Instead consider defining the macro in a (configured) header file. Then report the limitation.\n• : Per-configuration preprocessor definitions on a source file.\n\n This is the configuration-specific version of COMPILE_DEFINITIONS. Note that Xcode does not support per-configuration source file flags so this property will be ignored by the Xcode generator.\n• : Additional flags to be added when compiling this source file.\n\n These flags will be added to the list of compile flags when this source file builds. Use COMPILE_DEFINITIONS to pass additional preprocessor definitions.\n• : If set to true then this is an object file.\n\n If this property is set to true then the source file is really an object file and should not be compiled. It will still be linked into the target though.\n• : Is this source file generated as part of the build process.\n\n If a source file is generated by the build process CMake will handle it differently in temrs of dependency checking etc. Otherwise having a non-existent source file could create problems.\n• : Is this source file only a header file.\n\n A property on a source file that indicates if the source file is a header file with no associated implementation. This is set automatically based on the file extension and is used by CMake to determine is certain dependency information should be computed.\n• : Make the output file have the same extension as the source file.\n\n If this property is set then the file extension of the output file will be the same as that of the source file. Normally the output file extension is computed based on the language of the source file, for example .cxx will go to a .o extension.\n• : Specify a list of text labels associated with a source file.\n\n This property has meaning only when the source file is listed in a target whose LABELS property is also set. No other semantics are currently specified.\n• : What programming language is the file.\n\n A property that can be set to indicate what programming language the source file is. If it is not set the language is determined based on the file extension. Typical values are CXX C etc.\n• : The full path to a source file.\n\n A read only property on a SOURCE FILE that contains the full path to the source file.\n• : Place a source file inside a Mac OS X bundle or framework.\n\n Executable targets with the MACOSX_BUNDLE property set are built as Mac OS X application bundles on Apple platforms. Shared library targets with the FRAMEWORK property set are built as Mac OS X frameworks on Apple platforms. Source files listed in the target with this property set will be copied to a directory inside the bundle or framework content folder specified by the property value. For bundles the content folder is \"<name>.app/Contents\". For frameworks the content folder is \"<name>.framework/Versions/<version>\". See the PUBLIC_HEADER, PRIVATE_HEADER, and RESOURCE target properties for specifying files meant for Headers, PrivateHeadres, or Resources directories.\n• : Additional files on which a compiled object file depends.\n\n Specifies a semicolon-separated list of full-paths to files on which any object files compiled from this source file depend. An object file will be recompiled if any of the named files is newer than it.\n\n This property need not be used to specify the dependency of a source file on a generated header file that it includes. Although the property was originally introduced for this purpose, it is no longer necessary. If the generated header file is created by a custom command in the same target as the source file, the automatic dependency scanning process will recognize the dependency. If the generated header file is created by another target, an inter-target dependency should be created with the add_dependencies command (if one does not already exist due to linking relationships).\n• : Additional outputs for a Makefile rule.\n\n Additional outputs created by compilation of this source file. If any of these outputs is missing the object will be recompiled. This is supported only on Makefile generators and will be ignored on other generators.\n• : Is this just a name for a rule.\n\n If SYMBOLIC (boolean) is set to true the build system will be informed that the source file is not actually created on disk but instead used as a symbolic name for a build rule.\n• : Exclude this source file from any code wrapping techniques.\n\n Some packages can wrap source files into alternate languages to provide additional functionality. For example, C++ code can be wrapped into Java or Python etc using SWIG etc. If WRAP_EXCLUDE is set to true (1 etc) that indicates then this source file should not be wrapped.\n• : True if entry should be hidden by default in GUIs.\n\n This is a boolean value indicating whether the entry is considered interesting only for advanced configuration. The mark_as_advanced() command modifies this property.\n• : Help associated with entry in GUIs.\n\n This string summarizes the purpose of an entry to help users set it through a CMake GUI.\n• : Internal management property. Do not set or get.\n\n This is an internal cache entry property managed by CMake to track interactive user modification of entries. Ignore it.\n• : Enumerate possible STRING entry values for GUI selection.\n\n For cache entries with type STRING, this enumerates a set of values. CMake GUIs may use this to provide a selection widget instead of a generic string entry field. This is for convenience only. CMake does not enforce that the value matches one of those listed.\n• : Widget type for entry in GUIs.\n\n Cache entry values are always strings, but CMake GUIs present widgets to help users set values. The GUIs use this property as a hint to determine the widget type. Valid TYPE values are:\n\n BOOL = Boolean ON/OFF value.\n\n PATH = Path to a directory.\n\n FILEPATH = Path to a file.\n\n STRING = Generic string value.\n\n INTERNAL = Do not present in GUI at all.\n\n STATIC = Value managed by CMake, do not change.\n\n UNINITIALIZED = Type not yet specified.\n\n Generally the TYPE of a cache entry should be set by the command which creates it (set, option, find_library, etc.).\n• : Value of a cache entry.\n\n This property maps to the actual value of a cache entry. Setting this property always sets the value without checking, so use with care.\n\nThis is the documentation for now obsolete listfile commands from previous CMake versions, which are still supported for compatibility reasons. You should instead use the newer, faster and shinier new commands. ;-)\n• : Deprecated. Use ${CMAKE_SYSTEM} and ${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER} instead.\n\n Sets the specified variable to a string representing the platform and compiler settings. These values are now available through the CMAKE_SYSTEM and CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER variables.\n• : Deprecated. Use the execute_process() command instead.\n\n Run an executable program during the processing of the CMakeList.txt file.\n\n exec_program(Executable [directory in which to run]\n\n [ARGS <arguments to executable>]\n\n [OUTPUT_VARIABLE <var>]\n\n [RETURN_VALUE <var>])\n\n The executable is run in the optionally specified directory. The executable can include arguments if it is double quoted, but it is better to use the optional ARGS argument to specify arguments to the program. This is because cmake will then be able to escape spaces in the executable path. An optional argument OUTPUT_VARIABLE specifies a variable in which to store the output. To capture the return value of the execution, provide a RETURN_VALUE. If OUTPUT_VARIABLE is specified, then no output will go to the stdout/stderr of the console running cmake.\n• : Deprecated. Use INSTALL(EXPORT) or EXPORT command.\n\n This command generates an old-style library dependencies file. Projects requiring CMake 2.6 or later should not use the command. Use instead the install(EXPORT) command to help export targets from an installation tree and the export() command to export targets from a build tree.\n\n The old-style library dependencies file does not take into account per-configuration names of libraries or the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES target property.\n\n Create a file named <file> that can be included into a CMake listfile with the INCLUDE command. The file will contain a number of SET commands that will set all the variables needed for library dependency information. This should be the last command in the top level CMakeLists.txt file of the project. If the APPEND option is specified, the SET commands will be appended to the given file instead of replacing it.\n• : Deprecated. Use the install(FILES ) command instead.\n\n This command has been superceded by the install command. It is provided for compatibility with older CMake code. The FILES form is directly replaced by the FILES form of the install command. The regexp form can be expressed more clearly using the GLOB form of the file command.\n\n Create rules to install the listed files with the given extension into the given directory. Only files existing in the current source tree or its corresponding location in the binary tree may be listed. If a file specified already has an extension, that extension will be removed first. This is useful for providing lists of source files such as foo.cxx when you want the corresponding foo.h to be installed. A typical extension is '.h'.\n\n Any files in the current source directory that match the regular expression will be installed.\n\n Any files listed after the FILES keyword will be installed explicitly from the names given. Full paths are allowed in this form.\n\n The directory <dir> is relative to the installation prefix, which is stored in the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.\n• : Deprecated. Use the install(PROGRAMS ) command instead.\n\n This command has been superceded by the install command. It is provided for compatibility with older CMake code. The FILES form is directly replaced by the PROGRAMS form of the INSTALL command. The regexp form can be expressed more clearly using the GLOB form of the FILE command.\n\n Create rules to install the listed programs into the given directory. Use the FILES argument to guarantee that the file list version of the command will be used even when there is only one argument.\n\n In the second form any program in the current source directory that matches the regular expression will be installed.\n\n This command is intended to install programs that are not built by cmake, such as shell scripts. See the TARGETS form of the INSTALL command to create installation rules for targets built by cmake.\n\n The directory <dir> is relative to the installation prefix, which is stored in the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.\n• : Deprecated. Use the install(TARGETS ) command instead.\n\n This command has been superceded by the install command. It is provided for compatibility with older CMake code.\n\n Create rules to install the listed targets into the given directory. The directory <dir> is relative to the installation prefix, which is stored in the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. If RUNTIME_DIRECTORY is specified, then on systems with special runtime files (Windows DLL), the files will be copied to that directory.\n• : Deprecated. Use the target_link_libraries() command instead.\n\n Specify a list of libraries to be linked into any following targets (typically added with the add_executable or add_library calls). This command is passed down to all subdirectories. The debug and optimized strings may be used to indicate that the next library listed is to be used only for that specific type of build.\n• : Deprecated. Use the file(MAKE_DIRECTORY ) command instead.\n\n Creates the specified directory. Full paths should be given. Any parent directories that do not exist will also be created. Use with care.\n• : Deprecated. Use the list(REMOVE_ITEM ) command instead.\n\n Removes VALUE from the variable VAR. This is typically used to remove entries from a vector (e.g. semicolon separated list). VALUE is expanded.\n• : Deprecated. Does nothing.\n\n Does not do anything. This command used to help projects order parallel builds correctly. This functionality is now automatic.\n• : Deprecated. Use the add_subdirectory() command instead.\n\n Add a list of subdirectories to the build.\n\n Add a list of subdirectories to the build. The add_subdirectory command should be used instead of subdirs although subdirs will still work. This will cause any CMakeLists.txt files in the sub directories to be processed by CMake. Any directories after the PREORDER flag are traversed first by makefile builds, the PREORDER flag has no effect on IDE projects. Any directories after the EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL marker will not be included in the top level makefile or project file. This is useful for having CMake create makefiles or projects for a set of examples in a project. You would want CMake to generate makefiles or project files for all the examples at the same time, but you would not want them to show up in the top level project or be built each time make is run from the top.\n• : Copy mesa headers for use in combination with system GL.\n\n The path to mesa includes, should contain gl_mangle.h. The mesa headers are copied to the specified output directory. This allows mangled mesa headers to override other GL headers by being added to the include directory path earlier.\n• : Specify the source tree of a third-party utility.\n\n When a third-party utility's source is included in the distribution, this command specifies its location and name. The cache entry will not be set unless the path_to_source and all listed files exist. It is assumed that the source tree of the utility will have been built before it is needed.\n\n When cross compiling CMake will print a warning if a utility_source() command is executed, because in many cases it is used to build an executable which is executed later on. This doesn't work when cross compiling, since the executable can run only on their target platform. So in this case the cache entry has to be adjusted manually so it points to an executable which is runnable on the build host.\n• : Deprecated. Use the if() command instead.\n\n The first argument (TEST_VARIABLE) is the name of the variable to be tested, if that variable is false nothing else is done. If TEST_VARIABLE is true, then the next argument (RESULT_VARIABLE) is a variable that is set to true if all the required variables are set. The rest of the arguments are variables that must be true or not set to NOTFOUND to avoid an error. If any are not true, an error is reported.\n• : Deprecated. Use the file(WRITE ) command instead.\n\n The first argument is the file name, the rest of the arguments are messages to write. If the argument APPEND is specified, then the message will be appended.\n\n NOTE 1: file(WRITE ... and file(APPEND ... do exactly the same as this one but add some more functionality.\n\n NOTE 2: When using write_file the produced file cannot be used as an input to CMake (CONFIGURE_FILE, source file ...) because it will lead to an infinite loop. Use configure_file if you want to generate input files to CMake.\n\nThe following modules are provided with CMake. They can be used with INCLUDE(ModuleName).\n\nThis is the documentation for the modules and scripts coming with CMake. Using these modules you can check the computer system for installed software packages, features of the compiler and the existance of headers to name just a few.\n• : ADD_FILE_DEPENDENCIES(source_file depend_files...)\n\n Adds the given files as dependencies to source_file\n• : \n\n A collection of CMake utility functions useful for dealing with .app bundles on the Mac and bundle-like directories on any OS.\n\n The following functions are provided by this script:\n\n Requires CMake 2.6 or greater because it uses function, break and PARENT_SCOPE. Also depends on GetPrerequisites.cmake.\n• : define a bunch of backwards compatibility variables\n\n CMAKE_ANSI_CXXFLAGS - flag for ansi c++ \n\n CMAKE_HAS_ANSI_STRING_STREAM - has <strstream>\n\n INCLUDE(TestForANSIStreamHeaders)\n\n INCLUDE(CheckIncludeFileCXX)\n\n INCLUDE(TestForSTDNamespace)\n\n INCLUDE(TestForANSIForScope)\n• : Macro to provide an option dependent on other options.\n\n This macro presents an option to the user only if a set of other conditions are true. When the option is not presented a default value is used, but any value set by the user is preserved for when the option is presented again. Example invocation:\n\n If USE_BAR is true and USE_ZOT is false, this provides an option called USE_FOO that defaults to ON. Otherwise, it sets USE_FOO to OFF. If the status of USE_BAR or USE_ZOT ever changes, any value for the USE_FOO option is saved so that when the option is re-enabled it retains its old value.\n• : Includes a public function for assisting users in trying to determine the\n\n Sets the passed in variable to one of the following values or an empty string if unknown.\n• : \n\n This module defines macros intended for use by cross-compiling toolchain files when CMake is not able to automatically detect the compiler identification.\n\n Macro CMAKE_FORCE_C_COMPILER has the following signature:\n\n It sets CMAKE_C_COMPILER to the given compiler and the cmake internal variable CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ID to the given compiler-id. It also bypasses the check for working compiler and basic compiler information tests.\n\n Macro CMAKE_FORCE_CXX_COMPILER has the following signature:\n\n It sets CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER to the given compiler and the cmake internal variable CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID to the given compiler-id. It also bypasses the check for working compiler and basic compiler information tests.\n\n Macro CMAKE_FORCE_Fortran_COMPILER has the following signature:\n\n It sets CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER to the given compiler and the cmake internal variable CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER_ID to the given compiler-id. It also bypasses the check for working compiler and basic compiler information tests.\n\n So a simple toolchain file could look like this:\n• : print system information\n\n This file can be used for diagnostic purposes just include it in a project to see various internal CMake variables.\n• : \n\n This script is used to verify that embeded manifests and side by side manifests for a project match. To run this script, cd to a directory and run the script with cmake -P. On the command line you can pass in versions that are OK even if not found in the .manifest files. For example, cmake -Dallow_versions=8.0.50608.0 -PCmakeVerifyManifest.cmake could be used to allow an embeded manifest of 8.0.50608.0 to be used in a project even if that version was not found in the .manifest file.\n• : Build binary and source package installers\n\n The CPack module generates binary and source installers in a variety of formats using the cpack program. Inclusion of the CPack module adds two new targets to the resulting makefiles, package and package_source, which build the binary and source installers, respectively. The generated binary installers contain everything installed via CMake's INSTALL command (and the deprecated INSTALL_FILES, INSTALL_PROGRAMS, and INSTALL_TARGETS commands).\n\n For certain kinds of binary installers (including the graphical installers on Mac OS X and Windows), CPack generates installers that allow users to select individual application components to install. The contents of each of the components are identified by the COMPONENT argument of CMake's INSTALL command. These components can be annotated with user-friendly names and descriptions, inter-component dependencies, etc., and grouped in various ways to customize the resulting installer. See the cpack_add_* commands, described below, for more information about component-specific installations.\n\n Before including the CPack module, there are a variety of variables that can be set to customize the resulting installers. The most commonly-used variables are:\n\n CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME - The name of the package (or application). If\n\n not specified, defaults to the project name.\n\n CPACK_PACKAGE_VENDOR - The name of the package vendor (e.g.,\n\n \"Kitware\").\n\n CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_FILE - A text file used to describe the\n\n project. Used, for example, the introduction screen of a\n\n CPack-generated Windows installer to describe the project.\n\n CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_SUMMARY - Short description of the\n\n project (only a few words).\n\n CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME - The name of the package file to generate,\n\n not including the extension. For example, cmake-2.6.1-Linux-i686.\n\n CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE - License file for the project, which\n\n will typically be displayed to the user (often with an explicit\n\n \"Accept\" button, for graphical installers) prior to installation.\n\n CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_README - ReadMe file for the project, which\n\n typically describes in some detail\n\n CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_WELCOME - Welcome file for the project, which\n\n welcomes users to this installer. Typically used in the graphical\n\n installers on Windows and Mac OS X.\n\n CPACK_MONOLITHIC_INSTALL - Disables the component-based \n\n installation mechanism, so that all components are always installed.\n\n CPACK_GENERATOR - List of CPack generators to use. If not\n\n specified, CPack will create a set of options (e.g.,\n\n CPACK_BINARY_NSIS) allowing the user to enable/disable individual\n\n generators.\n\n CPACK_OUTPUT_CONFIG_FILE - The name of the CPack configuration file\n\n for binary installers that will be generated by the CPack\n\n module. Defaults to CPackConfig.cmake.\n\n CPACK_PACKAGE_EXECUTABLES - Lists each of the executables along\n\n with a text label, to be used to create Start Menu shortcuts on\n\n Windows. For example, setting this to the list ccmake;CMake will\n\n create a shortcut named \"CMake\" that will execute the installed\n\n executable ccmake.\n\n CPACK_STRIP_FILES - List of files to be stripped. Starting with\n\n CMake 2.6.0 CPACK_STRIP_FILES will be a boolean variable which\n\n enables stripping of all files (a list of files evaluates to TRUE\n\n in CMake, so this change is compatible).\n\n The following CPack variables are specific to source packages, and will not affect binary packages:\n\n CPACK_SOURCE_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME - The name of the source package,\n\n e.g., cmake-2.6.1\n\n CPACK_SOURCE_STRIP_FILES - List of files in the source tree that\n\n will be stripped. Starting with CMake 2.6.0\n\n CPACK_SOURCE_STRIP_FILES will be a boolean variable which enables\n\n stripping of all files (a list of files evaluates to TRUE in CMake,\n\n so this change is compatible).\n\n CPACK_SOURCE_GENERATOR - List of generators used for the source\n\n packages. As with CPACK_GENERATOR, if this is not specified then\n\n CPack will create a set of options (e.g., CPACK_SOURCE_ZIP)\n\n allowing users to select which packages will be generated.\n\n CPACK_SOURCE_OUTPUT_CONFIG_FILE - The name of the CPack\n\n configuration file for source installers that will be generated by\n\n the CPack module. Defaults to CPackSourceConfig.cmake.\n\n CPACK_SOURCE_IGNORE_FILES - Pattern of files in the source tree\n\n that won't be packaged when building a source package. This is a\n\n list of patterns, e.g., /CVS/;/\\\\.svn/;\\\\.swp$;\\\\.#;/#;.*~;cscope.*\n\n The following variables are specific to the DragNDrop installers built on Mac OS X:\n\n CPACK_DMG_VOLUME_NAME - The volume name of the generated disk\n\n image. Defaults to CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME.\n\n CPACK_DMG_FORMAT - The disk image format. Common values are UDRO\n\n (UDIF read-only), UDZO (UDIF zlib-compressed) or UDBZ (UDIF\n\n bzip2-compressed). Refer to hdiutil(1) for more information on\n\n other available formats.\n\n CPACK_DMG_DS_STORE - Path to a custom .DS_Store file which e.g.\n\n can be used to specify the Finder window position/geometry and\n\n layout (such as hidden toolbars, placement of the icons etc.).\n\n This file has to be generated by the Finder (either manually or\n\n through OSA-script) using a normal folder from which the .DS_Store\n\n file can then be extracted.\n\n CPACK_DMG_BACKGROUND_IMAGE - Path to an image file which is to be\n\n used as the background for the Finder Window when the disk image\n\n is opened. By default no background image is set. The background\n\n image is applied after applying the custom .DS_Store file.\n\n CPACK_COMMAND_HDIUTIL - Path to the hdiutil(1) command used to\n\n operate on disk image files on Mac OS X. This variable can be used\n\n to override the automatically detected command (or specify its\n\n location if the auto-detection fails to find it.)\n\n CPACK_COMMAND_SETFILE - Path to the SetFile(1) command used to set\n\n extended attributes on files and directories on Mac OS X. This\n\n variable can be used to override the automatically detected\n\n command (or specify its location if the auto-detection fails to\n\n find it.)\n\n CPACK_COMMAND_REZ - Path to the Rez(1) command used to compile\n\n resources on Mac OS X. This variable can be used to override the\n\n automatically detected command (or specify its location if the\n\n auto-detection fails to find it.)\n\n Installers built on Mac OS X using the Bundle generator use the aforementioned DragNDrop variables, plus the following Bundle-specific parameters:\n\n CPACK_BUNDLE_NAME - The name of the generated bundle. This\n\n appears in the OSX finder as the bundle name. Required.\n\n CPACK_BUNDLE_PLIST - Path to an OSX plist file that will be used\n\n as the Info.plist for the generated bundle. This assumes that\n\n the caller has generated or specified their own Info.plist file.\n\n Required.\n\n CPACK_BUNDLE_ICON - Path to an OSX icns file that will be used as\n\n the icon for the generated bundle. This is the icon that appears\n\n in the OSX finder for the bundle, and in the OSX dock when the\n\n bundle is opened. Required.\n\n CPACK_BUNDLE_STARTUP_SCRIPT - Path to an executable or script that\n\n will be run whenever an end-user double-clicks the generated bundle\n\n in the OSX Finder. Optional.\n\n The following variables are specific to the graphical installers built on Windows using the Nullsoft Installation System.\n\n CPACK_NSIS_MUI_ICON - The icon file (.ico) for the generated\n\n install program.\n\n CPACK_NSIS_MUI_UNIICON - The icon file (.ico) for the generated\n\n uninstall program.\n\n CPACK_PACKAGE_ICON - A branding image that will be displayed inside\n\n the installer.\n\n CPACK_NSIS_EXTRA_INSTALL_COMMANDS - Extra NSIS commands that will\n\n be added to the install Section.\n\n CPACK_NSIS_EXTRA_UNINSTALL_COMMANDS - Extra NSIS commands that will\n\n be added to the uninstall Section.\n\n CPACK_NSIS_COMPRESSOR - The arguments that will be passed to the\n\n NSIS SetCompressor command.\n\n CPACK_NSIS_MODIFY_PATH - If this is set to \"ON\", then an extra page\n\n will appear in the installer that will allow the user to choose\n\n whether the program directory should be added to the system PATH\n\n variable.\n\n CPACK_NSIS_DISPLAY_NAME - The display name string that appears in\n\n the Windows Add/Remove Program control panel\n\n CPACK_NSIS_PACKAGE_NAME - The title displayed at the top of the\n\n installer.\n\n CPACK_NSIS_INSTALLED_ICON_NAME - A path to the executable that\n\n contains the installer icon.\n\n CPACK_NSIS_URL_INFO_ABOUT - URL to a web site providing more\n\n information about your application.\n\n CPACK_NSIS_CONTACT - Contact information for questions and comments\n\n about the installation process.\n\n The following variable is specific to installers build on Mac OS X using PackageMaker:\n\n CPACK_OSX_PACKAGE_VERSION - The version of Mac OS X that the\n\n resulting PackageMaker archive should be compatible\n\n with. Different versions of Mac OS X support different\n\n features. For example, CPack can only build component-based\n\n installers for Mac OS X 10.4 or newer, and can only build\n\n installers that download component son-the-fly for Mac OS X 10.5\n\n or newer. If left blank, this value will be set to the minimum\n\n version of Mac OS X that supports the requested features. Set this\n\n variable to some value (e.g., 10.4) only if you want to guarantee\n\n that your installer will work on that version of Mac OS X, and\n\n don't mind missing extra features available in the installer\n\n shipping with later versions of Mac OS X.\n\n The following variables are for advanced uses of CPack:\n\n CPACK_CMAKE_GENERATOR - What CMake generator should be used if the\n\n project is CMake project. Defaults to the value of CMAKE_GENERATOR;\n\n few users will want to change this setting.\n\n CPACK_INSTALL_CMAKE_PROJECTS - List of four values that specify\n\n what project to install. The four values are: Build directory,\n\n Project Name, Project Component, Directory. If omitted, CPack will\n\n build an installer that installers everything.\n\n CPACK_SYSTEM_NAME - System name, defaults to the value of\n\n ${CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME}.\n\n CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION - Package full version, used internally. By\n\n default, this is built from CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR,\n\n CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR, and CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH.\n\n Component-specific installation allows users to select specific sets of components to install during the install process. Installation components are identified by the COMPONENT argument of CMake's INSTALL commands, and should be further described by the following CPack commands:\n\n cpack_add_component - Describes a CPack installation component\n\n named by the COMPONENT argument to a CMake INSTALL command.\n\n The cmake_add_component command describes an installation\n\n component, which the user can opt to install or remove as part of\n\n the graphical installation process. compname is the name of the\n\n component, as provided to the COMPONENT argument of one or more\n\n CMake INSTALL commands.\n\n DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the component, used in\n\n graphical installers to display the component name. This value can\n\n be any string.\n\n DESCRIPTION is an extended description of the component, used in\n\n graphical installers to give the user additional information about\n\n the component. Descriptions can span multiple lines using \"\n\n\" as\n\n the line separator. Typically, these descriptions should be no\n\n more than a few lines long.\n\n HIDDEN indicates that this component will be hidden in the\n\n graphical installer, so that the user cannot directly change\n\n whether it is installed or not.\n\n REQUIRED indicates that this component is required, and therefore\n\n will always be installed. It will be visible in the graphical\n\n installer, but it cannot be unselected. (Typically, required\n\n components are shown greyed out).\n\n DISABLED indicates that this component should be disabled\n\n (unselected) by default. The user is free to select this component\n\n for installation, unless it is also HIDDEN.\n\n DEPENDS lists the components on which this component depends. If\n\n this component is selected, then each of the components listed\n\n must also be selected. The dependency information is encoded\n\n within the installer itself, so that users cannot install\n\n inconsitent sets of components.\n\n GROUP names the component group of which this component is a\n\n part. If not provided, the component will be a standalone\n\n component, not part of any component group. Component groups are\n\n described with the cpack_add_component_group command, detailed\n\n below.\n\n INSTALL_TYPES lists the installation types of which this component\n\n is a part. When one of these installations types is selected, this\n\n component will automatically be selected. Installation types are\n\n described with the cpack_add_install_type command, detailed below.\n\n DOWNLOADED indicates that this component should be downloaded\n\n on-the-fly by the installer, rather than packaged in with the\n\n installer itself. For more information, see the cpack_configure_downloads\n\n command.\n\n ARCHIVE_FILE provides a name for the archive file created by CPack\n\n to be used for downloaded components. If not supplied, CPack will\n\n create a file with some name based on CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME and\n\n the name of the component. See cpack_configure_downloads for more\n\n information.\n\n The cpack_add_component_group describes a group of installation\n\n components, which will be placed together within the listing of\n\n options. Typically, component groups allow the user to\n\n select/deselect all of the components within a single group via a\n\n single group-level option. Use component groups to reduce the\n\n complexity of installers with many options. groupname is an\n\n arbitrary name used to identify the group in the GROUP argument of\n\n the cpack_add_component command, which is used to place a\n\n component in a group. The name of the group must not conflict with\n\n the name of any component.\n\n DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the component group, used in\n\n graphical installers to display the component group name. This\n\n value can be any string.\n\n DESCRIPTION is an extended description of the component group,\n\n used in graphical installers to give the user additional\n\n information about the components within that group. Descriptions\n\n can span multiple lines using \"\n\n\" as the line\n\n separator. Typically, these descriptions should be no more than a\n\n few lines long.\n\n PARENT_GROUP, if supplied, names the parent group of this group. \n\n Parent groups are used to establish a hierarchy of groups, \n\n providing an arbitrary hierarchy of groups.\n\n EXPANDED indicates that, by default, the group should show up as\n\n \"expanded\", so that the user immediately sees all of the\n\n components within the group. Otherwise, the group will initially\n\n show up as a single entry.\n\n BOLD_TITLE indicates that the group title should appear in bold,\n\n to call the user's attention to the group.\n\n cpack_add_install_type - Add a new installation type containing a\n\n set of predefined component selections to the graphical installer.\n\n \n\n cpack_add_install_type(typename\n\n [DISPLAY_NAME name]) \n\n The cpack_add_install_type command identifies a set of preselected\n\n components that represents a common use case for an\n\n application. For example, a \"Developer\" install type might include\n\n an application along with its header and library files, while an\n\n \"End user\" install type might just include the application's\n\n executable. Each component identifies itself with one or more\n\n install types via the INSTALL_TYPES argument to\n\n cpack_add_component.\n\n DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the install type, which will\n\n typically show up in a drop-down box within a graphical\n\n installer. This value can be any string.\n\n cpack_configure_downloads - Configure CPack to download selected\n\n components on-the-fly as part of the installation process.\n\n The cpack_configure_downloads command configures installation-time\n\n downloads of selected components. For each downloadable component,\n\n CPack will create an archive containing the contents of that\n\n component, which should be uploaded to the given site. When the\n\n user selects that component for installation, the installer will\n\n download and extract the component in place. This feature is\n\n useful for creating small installers that only download the\n\n requested components, saving bandwidth. Additionally, the\n\n installers are small enough that they will be installed as part of\n\n the normal installation process, and the \"Change\" button in\n\n Windows Add/Remove Programs control panel will allow one to add or\n\n remove parts of the application after the original\n\n installation. On Windows, the downloaded-components functionality\n\n requires the ZipDLL plug-in for NSIS, available at:\n\n On Mac OS X, installers that download components on-the-fly can\n\n only be built and installed on system using Mac OS X 10.5 or\n\n later.\n\n The site argument is a URL where the archives for downloadable \n\n components will reside, e.g., http://www.cmake.org/files/2.6.1/installer/\n\n All of the archives produced by CPack should be uploaded to that location.\n\n UPLOAD_DIRECTORY is the local directory where CPack will create the \n\n various archives for each of the components. The contents of this\n\n directory should be uploaded to a location accessible by the URL given\n\n in the site argument. If omitted, CPack will use the directory \n\n CPackUploads inside the CMake binary directory to store the generated\n\n archives.\n\n The ALL flag indicates that all components be downloaded. Otherwise, only \n\n those components explicitly marked as DOWNLOADED or that have a specified \n\n ARCHIVE_FILE will be downloaded. Additionally, the ALL option implies\n\n ADD_REMOVE (unless NO_ADD_REMOVE is specified).\n\n ADD_REMOVE indicates that CPack should install a copy of the installer\n\n that can be called from Windows' Add/Remove Programs dialog (via the \n\n \"Modify\" button) to change the set of installed components. NO_ADD_REMOVE\n\n turns off this behavior. This option is ignored on Mac OS X.\n• : The builtin (binary) CPack Deb generator (Unix only)\n\n CPackDeb may be used to create Deb package using CPack. CPackDeb is a CPack generator thus it uses the CPACK_XXX variables used by CPack : http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake:CPackConfiguration\n\n However CPackRPM has specific features which are controlled by the specifics CPACK_RPM_XXX variables.You'll find a detailed usage on the wiki: \n\n However as a handy reminder here comes the list of specific variables:\n\n Mandatory : YES\n\n Default : Output of dpkg --print-architecture or i386\n\n The debian package architecture\n\n Mandatory : NO\n\n Default : -\n\n May be used to set deb dependencies.\n• : The builtin (binary) CPack RPM generator (Unix only)\n\n CPackRPM may be used to create RPM package using CPack. CPackRPM is a CPack generator thus it uses the CPACK_XXX variables used by CPack : http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake:CPackConfiguration\n\n However CPackRPM has specific features which are controlled by the specifics CPACK_RPM_XXX variables. You'll find a detailed usage on the wiki: \n\n However as a handy reminder here comes the list of specific variables:\n\n CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_SUMMARY \n\n Mandatory : YES\n\n Default : CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION\n\n The RPM package summary\n\n CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_NAME\n\n Mandatory : YES\n\n Default : CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME\n\n The RPM package name\n\n CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_VERSION\n\n Mandatory : YES\n\n Default : CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION\n\n The RPM package version\n\n CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_ARCHITECTURE\n\n Mandatory : NO\n\n Default : -\n\n The RPM package architecture. This may be set to \"noarch\" if you \n\n know you are building a noarch package.\n\n CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_RELEASE\n\n Mandatory : YES\n\n Default : 1\n\n The RPM package release. This is the numbering of the RPM package \n\n itself, i.e. the version of the packaging and not the version of the \n\n content (see CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_VERSION). One may change the default \n\n value if the previous packaging was buggy and/or you want to put here\n\n a fancy Linux distro specific numbering.\n\n CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_LICENSE\n\n Mandatory : YES\n\n Default : \"unknown\"\n\n The RPM package license policy.\n\n CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_GROUP\n\n Mandatory : YES\n\n Default : \"unknown\"\n\n The RPM package group.\n\n CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_VENDOR \n\n Mandatory : YES\n\n Default : CPACK_PACKAGE_VENDOR if set or \"unknown\"\n\n The RPM package group.\n\n CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION\n\n Mandatory : YES\n\n Default : CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_FILE if set or \"no package description available\"\n\n CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_REQUIRES\n\n Mandatory : NO\n\n Default : -\n\n May be used to set RPM dependencies (requires).\n\n Note that you must enclose the complete requires string between quotes, \n\n for example:\n\n set(CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_REQUIRES \"python >= 2.5.0, cmake >= 2.8\")\n\n CPACK_RPM_PACKAGES_PROVIDES\n\n Mandatory : NO\n\n Default : -\n\n May be used to set RPM dependencies (provides).\n\n CPACK_RPM_SPEC_INSTALL_POST\n\n Mandatory : NO\n\n Default : -\n\n May be used to set an RPM post-install command inside the spec file. \n\n For example setting it to \"/bin/true\" may be used to prevent \n\n rpmbuild to strip binaries.\n\n CPACK_RPM_SPEC_MORE_DEFINE\n\n Mandatory : NO\n\n Default : -\n\n May be used to add any %define lines to the generated spec file.\n\n CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_DEBUG\n\n Mandatory : NO\n\n Default : -\n\n May be set when invoking cpack in order to trace debug informations \n\n during CPack RPM run. For example you may launch CPack like this \n\n cpack -D CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_DEBUG=1 -G RPM\n\n CPACK_RPM_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE\n\n Mandatory : NO\n\n Default : - \n\n May be set by the user in order to specify a USER binary spec file\n\n to be used by CPackRPM instead of generating the file.\n\n The specified file will be processed by CONFIGURE_FILE( @ONLY).\n\n CPACK_RPM_GENERATE_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE_TEMPLATE\n\n Mandatory : NO\n\n Default : -\n\n If set CPack will generate a template for USER specified binary \n\n spec file and stop with an error.

After including the module, use code like\n\n to creating tests when testing is enabled.\n\n To enable submissions to a CDash server, create a CTestConfig.cmake file at the top of the project with content such as\n\n (the CDash server can provide the file to a project administrator who configures 'MyProject'). Settings in the config file are shared by both this CTest module and the CTest command-line tool's dashboard script mode (ctest -S).\n\n While building a project for submission to CDash, CTest scans the build output for errors and warnings and reports them with surrounding context from the build log. This generic approach works for all build tools, but does not give details about the command invocation that produced a given problem. One may get more detailed reports by adding\n\n to the CTestConfig.cmake file. When this option is enabled, the CTest module tells CMake's Makefile generators to invoke every command in the generated build system through a CTest launcher program. (Currently the CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS option is ignored on non-Makefile generators.) During a manual build each launcher transparently runs the command it wraps. During a CTest-driven build for submission to CDash each launcher reports detailed information when its command fails or warns. (Setting CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS in CTestConfig.cmake is convenient, but also adds the launcher overhead even for manual builds.

It supports using the old Dart 1 Tcl client for driving dashboard submissions as well as testing with CTest. This module should be included in the CMakeLists.txt file at the top of a project. Typical usage:\n\n The BUILD_TESTING option is created by the Dart module to determine whether testing support should be enabled. The default is ON.\n• : DocumentationVTK.cmake\n\n This file provides support for the VTK documentation framework. It relies on several tools (Doxygen, Perl, etc).\n• : Create custom targets to build projects in external trees\n\n The 'ExternalProject_Add' function creates a custom target to drive download, update/patch, configure, build, install and test steps of an external project:\n\n ExternalProject_Add(<name> # Name for custom target\n\n [DEPENDS projects...] # Targets on which the project depends\n\n [PREFIX dir] # Root dir for entire project\n\n [LIST_SEPARATOR sep] # Sep to be replaced by ; in cmd lines\n\n [TMP_DIR dir] # Directory to store temporary files\n\n [STAMP_DIR dir] # Directory to store step timestamps\n\n #--Download step--------------\n\n [DOWNLOAD_DIR dir] # Directory to store downloaded files\n\n [DOWNLOAD_COMMAND cmd...] # Command to download source tree\n\n [CVS_REPOSITORY cvsroot] # CVSROOT of CVS repository\n\n [CVS_MODULE mod] # Module to checkout from CVS repo\n\n [CVS_TAG tag] # Tag to checkout from CVS repo\n\n [SVN_REPOSITORY url] # URL of Subversion repo\n\n [SVN_REVISION rev] # Revision to checkout from Subversion repo\n\n [URL /.../src.tgz] # Full path or URL of source\n\n [TIMEOUT seconds] # Time allowed for file download operations\n\n #--Update/Patch step----------\n\n [UPDATE_COMMAND cmd...] # Source work-tree update command\n\n [PATCH_COMMAND cmd...] # Command to patch downloaded source\n\n #--Configure step-------------\n\n [SOURCE_DIR dir] # Source dir to be used for build\n\n [CONFIGURE_COMMAND cmd...] # Build tree configuration command\n\n [CMAKE_COMMAND /.../cmake] # Specify alternative cmake executable\n\n [CMAKE_GENERATOR gen] # Specify generator for native build\n\n [CMAKE_ARGS args...] # Arguments to CMake command line\n\n #--Build step-----------------\n\n [BINARY_DIR dir] # Specify build dir location\n\n [BUILD_COMMAND cmd...] # Command to drive the native build\n\n [BUILD_IN_SOURCE 1] # Use source dir for build dir\n\n #--Install step---------------\n\n [INSTALL_DIR dir] # Installation prefix\n\n [INSTALL_COMMAND cmd...] # Command to drive install after build\n\n #--Test step---------------\n\n [TEST_BEFORE_INSTALL 1] # Add test step executed before install step\n\n [TEST_AFTER_INSTALL 1] # Add test step executed after install step\n\n [TEST_COMMAND cmd...] # Command to drive test\n\n )\n\n The *_DIR options specify directories for the project, with default directories computed as follows. If the PREFIX option is given to ExternalProject_Add() or the EP_PREFIX directory property is set, then an external project is built and installed under the specified prefix:\n\n Otherwise, if the EP_BASE directory property is set then components of an external project are stored under the specified base:\n\n If no PREFIX, EP_PREFIX, or EP_BASE is specified then the default is to set PREFIX to \"<name>-prefix\". Relative paths are interpreted with respect to the build directory corresponding to the source directory in which ExternalProject_Add is invoked.\n\n If SOURCE_DIR is explicitly set to an existing directory the project will be built from it. Otherwise a download step must be specified using one of the DOWNLOAD_COMMAND, CVS_*, SVN_*, or URL options. The URL option may refer locally to a directory or source tarball, or refer to a remote tarball (e.g. http://.../src.tgz).\n\n The 'ExternalProject_Add_Step' function adds a custom step to an external project:\n\n ExternalProject_Add_Step(<name> <step> # Names of project and custom step\n\n [COMMAND cmd...] # Command line invoked by this step\n\n [COMMENT \"text...\"] # Text printed when step executes\n\n [DEPENDEES steps...] # Steps on which this step depends\n\n [DEPENDERS steps...] # Steps that depend on this step\n\n [DEPENDS files...] # Files on which this step depends\n\n [ALWAYS 1] # No stamp file, step always runs\n\n [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir] # Working directory for command\n\n )\n\n The command line, comment, and working directory of every standard and custom step is processed to replace tokens <SOURCE_DIR>, <BINARY_DIR>, <INSTALL_DIR>, and <TMP_DIR> with corresponding property values.\n\n It stores property values in variables of the same name. Property names correspond to the keyword argument names of 'ExternalProject_Add'.\n• : Macros for generating a summary of enabled/disabled features\n\n Print a summary of all enabled features.

A header file is also be generated, and contains the token list. If COMPILE_FLAGS option is specified, the next parameter is added in the bison command line. if VERBOSE option is specified, <file> is created and contains verbose descriptions of the grammar and parser. The macro defines a set of variables:\n\n BISON_${Name}_DEFINED - true is the macro ran successfully\n\n BISON_${Name}_INPUT - The input source file, an alias for <YaccInput>\n\n BISON_${Name}_OUTPUT_SOURCE - The source file generated by bison\n\n BISON_${Name}_OUTPUT_HEADER - The header file generated by bison\n\n BISON_${Name}_OUTPUTS - The sources files generated by bison\n\n BISON_${Name}_COMPILE_FLAGS - Options used in the bison command line\n• : Find BLAS library\n\n This module finds an installed fortran library that implements the BLAS linear-algebra interface (see http://www.netlib.org/blas/). The list of libraries searched for is taken from the autoconf macro file, acx_blas.m4 (distributed at http://ac-archive.sourceforge.net/ac-archive/acx_blas.html).\n\n This module sets the following variables:\n\n BLAS_FOUND - set to true if a library implementing the BLAS interface\n\n is found\n\n BLAS_LINKER_FLAGS - uncached list of required linker flags (excluding -l\n\n and -L).\n\n BLAS_LIBRARIES - uncached list of libraries (using full path name) to\n\n link against to use BLAS\n\n BLAS95_LIBRARIES - uncached list of libraries (using full path name)\n\n to link against to use BLAS95 interface\n\n BLAS95_FOUND - set to true if a library implementing the BLAS f95 interface\n\n is found\n\n BLA_STATIC if set on this determines what kind of linkage we do (static)\n\n BLA_VENDOR if set checks only the specified vendor, if not set checks\n\n all the possibilities\n\n BLA_F95 if set on tries to find the f95 interfaces for BLAS/LAPACK\n\n ######### ## List of vendors (BLA_VENDOR) valid in this module # ATLAS, PhiPACK,CXML,DXML,SunPerf,SCSL,SGIMATH,IBMESSL,Intel10_32 (intel mkl v10 32 bit),Intel10_64lp (intel mkl v10 64 bit,lp thread model, lp64 model), # Intel( older versions of mkl 32 and 64 bit), ACML,Apple, NAS, Generic C/CXX should be enabled to use Intel mkl\n• : Try to find BZip2\n\n Once done this will define\n\n BZIP2_FOUND - system has BZip2\n\n BZIP2_INCLUDE_DIR - the BZip2 include directory\n\n BZIP2_LIBRARIES - Link these to use BZip2\n\n BZIP2_DEFINITIONS - Compiler switches required for using BZip2\n\n BZIP2_NEED_PREFIX - this is set if the functions are prefixed with BZ2_\n• : Try to find Boost include dirs and libraries\n\n Usage of this module as follows:\n\n NOTE: Take note of the Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS variable below. Due to Boost naming conventions and limitations in CMake this find module is NOT future safe with respect to Boost version numbers, and may break.\n\n == Using Header-Only libraries from within Boost: ==\n\n == Using actual libraries from within Boost: ==\n\n The components list needs to contain actual names of boost libraries only, such as \"date_time\" for \"libboost_date_time\". If you're using parts of Boost that contain header files only (e.g. foreach) you do not need to specify COMPONENTS.\n\n You should provide a minimum version number that should be used. If you provide this version number and specify the REQUIRED attribute, this module will fail if it can't find the specified or a later version. If you specify a version number this is automatically put into the considered list of version numbers and thus doesn't need to be specified in the Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS variable (see below).\n\n Automatic linking is used on MSVC & Borland compilers by default when\n\n #including things in Boost. It's important to note that setting\n\n Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS to OFF is NOT enough to get you dynamic linking,\n\n should you need this feature. Automatic linking typically uses static\n\n libraries with a few exceptions (Boost.Python is one).\n\n Please see the section below near Boost_LIB_DIAGNOSTIC_DEFINITIONS for\n\n more details. Adding a TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES() as shown in the example\n\n above appears to cause VS to link dynamically if Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS\n\n gets set to OFF. It is suggested you avoid automatic linking since it\n\n will make your application less portable.\n\n =========== The mess that is Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS (sorry?) ============\n\n OK, so the Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS variable can be used to specify a list of boost version numbers that should be taken into account when searching for Boost. Unfortunately boost puts the version number into the actual filename for the libraries, so this variable will certainly be needed in the future when new Boost versions are released.\n\n Currently this module searches for the following version numbers: 1.33, 1.33.0, 1.33.1, 1.34, 1.34.0, 1.34.1, 1.35, 1.35.0, 1.35.1, 1.36, 1.36.0, 1.36.1, 1.37, 1.37.0, 1.38, 1.38.0, 1.39, 1.39.0, 1.40, 1.40.0, 1.41, 1.41.0\n\n NOTE: If you add a new major 1.x version in Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS you should add both 1.x and 1.x.0 as shown above. Official Boost include directories omit the 3rd version number from include paths if it is 0 although not all binary Boost releases do so.\n\n Variables used by this module, they can change the default behaviour and need to be set before calling find_package:\n\n Boost_USE_MULTITHREADED Can be set to OFF to use the non-multithreaded\n\n boost libraries. If not specified, defaults\n\n to ON.\n\n Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS Can be set to ON to force the use of the static\n\n boost libraries. Defaults to OFF.\n\n Other Variables used by this module which you may want to set.\n\n Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS A list of version numbers to use for searching\n\n the boost include directory. Please see\n\n the documentation above regarding this\n\n annoying, but necessary variable :(\n\n Boost_DEBUG Set this to TRUE to enable debugging output\n\n of FindBoost.cmake if you are having problems.\n\n Please enable this before filing any bug\n\n reports.\n\n Boost_DETAILED_FAILURE_MSG FindBoost doesn't output detailed information\n\n about why it failed or how to fix the problem\n\n unless this is set to TRUE or the REQUIRED\n\n keyword is specified in find_package().\n\n [Since CMake 2.8.0]\n\n Boost_COMPILER Set this to the compiler suffix used by Boost\n\n (e.g. \"-gcc43\") if FindBoost has problems finding\n\n the proper Boost installation\n\n These last three variables are available also as environment variables:\n\n BOOST_ROOT or BOOSTROOT The preferred installation prefix for searching for\n\n Boost. Set this if the module has problems finding\n\n the proper Boost installation.\n\n BOOST_INCLUDEDIR Set this to the include directory of Boost, if the\n\n module has problems finding the proper Boost installation\n\n BOOST_LIBRARYDIR Set this to the lib directory of Boost, if the\n\n module has problems finding the proper Boost installation\n\n Boost_FOUND System has Boost, this means the include dir was\n\n found, as well as all the libraries specified in\n\n the COMPONENTS list.\n\n Boost_INCLUDE_DIR This is almost the same as above, but this one is\n\n cached and may be modified by advanced users\n\n Boost_LIBRARIES Link to these to use the Boost libraries that you\n\n specified: not cached\n\n Boost_LIBRARY_DIRS The path to where the Boost library files are.\n\n Boost_VERSION The version number of the boost libraries that\n\n have been found, same as in version.hpp from Boost\n\n Boost_LIB_VERSION The version number in filename form as\n\n it's appended to the library filenames\n\n Boost_MAJOR_VERSION major version number of boost\n\n Boost_MINOR_VERSION minor version number of boost\n\n Boost_SUBMINOR_VERSION subminor version number of boost\n\n Boost_LIB_DIAGNOSTIC_DEFINITIONS [WIN32 Only] You can call\n\n add_definitions(${Boost_LIB_DIAGNOSTIC_DEFINITIONS})\n\n to have diagnostic information about Boost's\n\n automatic linking outputted during compilation time.\n\n For each component you specify in find_package(), the following (UPPER-CASE) variables are set. You can use these variables if you would like to pick and choose components for your targets instead of just using Boost_LIBRARIES.\n\n Boost_${COMPONENT}_FOUND True IF the Boost library \"component\" was found.\n\n Boost_${COMPONENT}_LIBRARY Contains the libraries for the specified Boost\n\n \"component\" (includes debug and optimized keywords\n\n when needed).\n• : Try to find the Bullet physics engine\n\n This module defines the following variables\n\n BULLET_FOUND - Was bullet found\n\n BULLET_INCLUDE_DIRS - the Bullet include directories\n\n BULLET_LIBRARIES - Link to this, by default it includes\n\n all bullet components (Dynamics,\n\n Collision, LinearMath, & SoftBody)\n\n This module accepts the following variables\n\n BULLET_ROOT - Can be set to bullet install path or Windows build path\n• : Find CABLE\n\n This module finds if CABLE is installed and determines where the include files and libraries are. This code sets the following variables:\n\n CABLE the path to the cable executable\n\n CABLE_TCL_LIBRARY the path to the Tcl wrapper library\n\n CABLE_INCLUDE_DIR the path to the include directory\n\n To build Tcl wrappers, you should add shared library and link it to ${CABLE_TCL_LIBRARY}. You should also add ${CABLE_INCLUDE_DIR} as an include directory.\n• : Tools for building CUDA C files: libraries and build dependencies.\n\n This script locates the NVIDIA CUDA C tools. It should work on linux, windows, and mac and should be reasonably up to date with CUDA C releases.\n\n This script makes use of the standard find_package arguments of <VERSION>, REQUIRED and QUIET. CUDA_FOUND will report if an acceptable version of CUDA was found.\n\n The script will prompt the user to specify CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR if the prefix cannot be determined by the location of nvcc in the system path and REQUIRED is specified to find_package(). To use a different installed version of the toolkit set the environment variable CUDA_BIN_PATH before running cmake (e.g. CUDA_BIN_PATH=/usr/local/cuda1.0 instead of the default /usr/local/cuda) or set CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR after configuring. If you change the value of CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR, various components that depend on the path will be relocated.\n\n It might be necessary to set CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR manually on certain platforms, or to use a cuda runtime not installed in the default location. In newer versions of the toolkit the cuda library is included with the graphics driver- be sure that the driver version matches what is needed by the cuda runtime version.\n\n The following variables affect the behavior of the macros in the script (in alphebetical order). Note that any of these flags can be changed multiple times in the same directory before calling CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE, CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY, CUDA_COMPILE, CUDA_COMPILE_PTX or CUDA_WRAP_SRCS.\n\n CUDA_64_BIT_DEVICE_CODE (Default matches host bit size)\n\n -- Set to ON to compile for 64 bit device code, OFF for 32 bit device code.\n\n Note that making this different from the host code when generating object\n\n or C files from CUDA code just won't work, because size_t gets defined by\n\n nvcc in the generated source. If you compile to PTX and then load the\n\n file yourself, you can mix bit sizes between device and host.\n\n CUDA_ATTACH_VS_BUILD_RULE_TO_CUDA_FILE (Default ON)\n\n -- Set to ON if you want the custom build rule to be attached to the source\n\n file in Visual Studio. Turn OFF if you add the same cuda file to multiple\n\n targets.\n\n This allows the user to build the target from the CUDA file; however, bad\n\n things can happen if the CUDA source file is added to multiple targets.\n\n When performing parallel builds it is possible for the custom build\n\n command to be run more than once and in parallel causing cryptic build\n\n errors. VS runs the rules for every source file in the target, and a\n\n source can have only one rule no matter how many projects it is added to.\n\n When the rule is run from multiple targets race conditions can occur on\n\n the generated file. Eventually everything will get built, but if the user\n\n is unaware of this behavior, there may be confusion. It would be nice if\n\n this script could detect the reuse of source files across multiple targets\n\n and turn the option off for the user, but no good solution could be found.\n\n CUDA_BUILD_CUBIN (Default OFF)\n\n -- Set to ON to enable and extra compilation pass with the -cubin option in\n\n Device mode. The output is parsed and register, shared memory usage is\n\n printed during build.\n\n CUDA_BUILD_EMULATION (Default OFF for device mode)\n\n -- Set to ON for Emulation mode. -D_DEVICEEMU is defined for CUDA C files\n\n when CUDA_BUILD_EMULATION is TRUE.\n\n CUDA_GENERATED_OUTPUT_DIR (Default CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR)\n\n -- Set to the path you wish to have the generated files placed. If it is\n\n blank output files will be placed in CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR.\n\n Intermediate files will always be placed in\n\n CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR/CMakeFiles.\n\n CUDA_HOST_COMPILATION_CPP (Default ON)\n\n -- Set to OFF for C compilation of host code.\n\n CUDA_PROPAGATE_HOST_FLAGS (Default ON)\n\n -- Set to ON to propagate CMAKE_{C,CXX}_FLAGS and their configuration\n\n dependent counterparts (e.g. CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG) automatically to the\n\n host compiler through nvcc's -Xcompiler flag. This helps make the\n\n generated host code match the rest of the system better. Sometimes\n\n certain flags give nvcc problems, and this will help you turn the flag\n\n propagation off. This does not affect the flags supplied directly to nvcc\n\n via CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS or through the OPTION flags specified through\n\n CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY, CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE, or CUDA_WRAP_SRCS. Flags used for\n\n shared library compilation are not affected by this flag.\n\n CUDA_VERBOSE_BUILD (Default OFF)\n\n -- Set to ON to see all the commands used when building the CUDA file. When\n\n using a Makefile generator the value defaults to VERBOSE (run make\n\n VERBOSE=1 to see output), although setting CUDA_VERBOSE_BUILD to ON will\n\n always print the output.\n\n The script creates the following macros (in alphebetical order):\n\n CUDA_ADD_CUFFT_TO_TARGET( cuda_target )\n\n -- Adds the cufft library to the target (can be any target). Handles whether\n\n you are in emulation mode or not.\n\n CUDA_ADD_CUBLAS_TO_TARGET( cuda_target )\n\n -- Adds the cublas library to the target (can be any target). Handles\n\n whether you are in emulation mode or not.\n\n CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE( cuda_target file0 file1 ...\n\n [WIN32] [MACOSX_BUNDLE] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL] [OPTIONS ...] )\n\n -- Creates an executable \"cuda_target\" which is made up of the files\n\n specified. All of the non CUDA C files are compiled using the standard\n\n build rules specified by CMAKE and the cuda files are compiled to object\n\n files using nvcc and the host compiler. In addition CUDA_INCLUDE_DIRS is\n\n added automatically to include_directories(). Some standard CMake target\n\n calls can be used on the target after calling this macro\n\n (e.g. set_target_properties and target_link_libraries), but setting\n\n properties that adjust compilation flags will not affect code compiled by\n\n nvcc. Such flags should be modified before calling CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE,\n\n CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY or CUDA_WRAP_SRCS.\n\n CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY( cuda_target file0 file1 ...\n\n [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL] [OPTIONS ...] )\n\n -- Same as CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE except that a library is created.\n\n CUDA_BUILD_CLEAN_TARGET()\n\n -- Creates a convience target that deletes all the dependency files\n\n generated. You should make clean after running this target to ensure the\n\n dependency files get regenerated.\n\n CUDA_COMPILE( generated_files file0 file1 ... [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE]\n\n [OPTIONS ...] )\n\n -- Returns a list of generated files from the input source files to be used\n\n with ADD_LIBRARY or ADD_EXECUTABLE.\n\n CUDA_COMPILE_PTX( generated_files file0 file1 ... [OPTIONS ...] )\n\n -- Returns a list of PTX files generated from the input source files.\n\n CUDA_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES( path0 path1 ... )\n\n -- Sets the directories that should be passed to nvcc\n\n (e.g. nvcc -Ipath0 -Ipath1 ... ). These paths usually contain other .cu\n\n files.\n\n CUDA_WRAP_SRCS ( cuda_target format generated_files file0 file1 ...\n\n [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE] [OPTIONS ...] )\n\n -- This is where all the magic happens. CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE,\n\n CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY, CUDA_COMPILE, and CUDA_COMPILE_PTX all call this\n\n function under the hood.\n\n Given the list of files (file0 file1 ... fileN) this macro generates\n\n custom commands that generate either PTX or linkable objects (use \"PTX\" or\n\n \"OBJ\" for the format argument to switch). Files that don't end with .cu\n\n or have the HEADER_FILE_ONLY property are ignored.\n\n The arguments passed in after OPTIONS are extra command line options to\n\n give to nvcc. You can also specify per configuration options by\n\n specifying the name of the configuration followed by the options. General\n\n options must preceed configuration specific options. Not all\n\n configurations need to be specified, only the ones provided will be used.\n\n For certain configurations (namely VS generating object files with\n\n CUDA_ATTACH_VS_BUILD_RULE_TO_CUDA_FILE set to ON), no generated file will\n\n be produced for the given cuda file. This is because when you add the\n\n cuda file to Visual Studio it knows that this file produces an object file\n\n and will link in the resulting object file automatically.\n\n This script will also generate a separate cmake script that is used at\n\n build time to invoke nvcc. This is for serveral reasons.\n\n 1. nvcc can return negative numbers as return values which confuses\n\n Visual Studio into thinking that the command succeeded. The script now\n\n checks the error codes and produces errors when there was a problem.\n\n 2. nvcc has been known to not delete incomplete results when it\n\n encounters problems. This confuses build systems into thinking the\n\n target was generated when in fact an unusable file exists. The script\n\n now deletes the output files if there was an error.\n\n 3. By putting all the options that affect the build into a file and then\n\n make the build rule dependent on the file, the output files will be\n\n regenerated when the options change.\n\n This script also looks at optional arguments STATIC, SHARED, or MODULE to\n\n determine when to target the object compilation for a shared library.\n\n BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is ignored in CUDA_WRAP_SRCS, but it is respected in\n\n CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY. On some systems special flags are added for building\n\n objects intended for shared libraries. A preprocessor macro,\n\n <target_name>_EXPORTS is defined when a shared library compilation is\n\n detected.\n\n Flags passed into add_definitions with -D or /D are passed along to nvcc.\n\n The script defines the following variables:\n\n CUDA_VERSION_MAJOR -- The major version of cuda as reported by nvcc.\n\n CUDA_VERSION_MINOR -- The minor version.\n\n CUDA_VERSION\n\n CUDA_VERSION_STRING -- CUDA_VERSION_MAJOR.CUDA_VERSION_MINOR\n\n CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR -- Path to the CUDA Toolkit (defined if not set).\n\n CUDA_SDK_ROOT_DIR -- Path to the CUDA SDK. Use this to find files in the\n\n SDK. This script will not directly support finding\n\n specific libraries or headers, as that isn't\n\n supported by NVIDIA. If you want to change\n\n libraries when the path changes see the\n\n FindCUDA.cmake script for an example of how to clear\n\n these variables. There are also examples of how to\n\n use the CUDA_SDK_ROOT_DIR to locate headers or\n\n libraries, if you so choose (at your own risk).\n\n CUDA_INCLUDE_DIRS -- Include directory for cuda headers. Added automatically\n\n for CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE and CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY.\n\n CUDA_LIBRARIES -- Cuda RT library.\n\n CUDA_CUFFT_LIBRARIES -- Device or emulation library for the Cuda FFT\n\n implementation (alternative to:\n\n CUDA_ADD_CUFFT_TO_TARGET macro)\n\n CUDA_CUBLAS_LIBRARIES -- Device or emulation library for the Cuda BLAS\n\n implementation (alterative to:\n\n CUDA_ADD_CUBLAS_TO_TARGET macro).\n\n Copyright (c) 2007-2009\n\n Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah\n\n This code is licensed under the MIT License.

Depending upon the HDF5 Configuration, the wrapper compiler is called either h5cc or h5pcc. If this succeeds, the module will then call the compiler with the -show argument to see what flags are used when compiling an HDF5 client application.\n\n The module will optionally accept the COMPONENTS argument. If no COMPONENTS are specified, then the find module will default to finding only the HDF5 C library. If one or more COMPONENTS are specified, the module will attempt to find the language bindings for the specified components. Currently, the only valid components are C and CXX. The module does not yet support finding the Fortran bindings. If the COMPONENTS argument is not given, the module will attempt to find only the C bindings.\n\n On UNIX systems, this module will read the variable HDF5_USE_STATIC_LIBRARIES to determine whether or not to prefer a static link to a dynamic link for HDF5 and all of it's dependencies. To use this feature, make sure that the HDF5_USE_STATIC_LIBRARIES variable is set before the call to find_package.\n\n To provide the module with a hint about where to find your HDF5 installation, you can set the environment variable HDF5_ROOT. The Find module will then look in this path when searching for HDF5 executables, paths, and libraries.\n\n In addition to finding the includes and libraries required to compile an HDF5 client application, this module also makes an effort to find tools that come with the HDF5 distribution that may be useful for regression testing.\n\n This module will define the following variables:\n\n HDF5_INCLUDE_DIRS - Location of the hdf5 includes\n\n HDF5_INCLUDE_DIR - Location of the hdf5 includes (deprecated)\n\n HDF5_DEFINITIONS - Required compiler definitions for HDF5\n\n HDF5_C_LIBRARIES - Required libraries for the HDF5 C bindings.\n\n HDF5_CXX_LIBRARIES - Required libraries for the HDF5 C++ bindings\n\n HDF5_LIBRARIES - Required libraries for all requested bindings\n\n HDF5_FOUND - true if HDF5 was found on the system\n\n HDF5_LIBRARY_DIRS - the full set of library directories\n\n HDF5_IS_PARALLEL - Whether or not HDF5 was found with parallel IO support\n\n HDF5_C_COMPILER_EXECUTABLE - the path to the HDF5 C wrapper compiler\n\n HDF5_CXX_COMPILER_EXECUTABLE - the path to the HDF5 C++ wrapper compiler\n\n HDF5_DIFF_EXECUTABLE - the path to the HDF5 dataset comparison tool\n• : Try to find HSPELL\n\n Once done this will define\n\n HSPELL_FOUND - system has HSPELL\n\n HSPELL_INCLUDE_DIR - the HSPELL include directory\n\n HSPELL_LIBRARIES - The libraries needed to use HSPELL\n\n HSPELL_DEFINITIONS - Compiler switches required for using HSPELL\n• : This module looks for Microsoft HTML Help Compiler\n\n HTML_HELP_COMPILER : full path to the Compiler (hhc.exe)\n\n HTML_HELP_INCLUDE_PATH : include path to the API (htmlhelp.h)\n\n HTML_HELP_LIBRARY : full path to the library (htmlhelp.lib)\n• : Find the ImageMagick binary suite.\n\n This module will search for a set of ImageMagick tools specified as components in the FIND_PACKAGE call. Typical components include, but are not limited to (future versions of ImageMagick might have additional components not listed here):\n\n If no component is specified in the FIND_PACKAGE call, then it only searches for the ImageMagick executable directory.

MPI is a standard interface (defined by the MPI forum) for which many implementations are available. All of these implementations have somewhat different compilation approaches (different include paths, libraries to link against, etc.), and this module tries to smooth out those differences.\n\n This module will set the following variables:\n\n MPI_FOUND TRUE if we have found MPI\n\n MPI_COMPILE_FLAGS Compilation flags for MPI programs\n\n MPI_INCLUDE_PATH Include path(s) for MPI header\n\n MPI_LINK_FLAGS Linking flags for MPI programs\n\n MPI_LIBRARY First MPI library to link against (cached)\n\n MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY Extra MPI libraries to link against (cached)\n\n MPI_LIBRARIES All libraries to link MPI programs against\n\n MPIEXEC Executable for running MPI programs\n\n MPIEXEC_NUMPROC_FLAG Flag to pass to MPIEXEC before giving it the\n\n number of processors to run on\n\n MPIEXEC_PREFLAGS Flags to pass to MPIEXEC directly before the\n\n executable to run.\n\n MPIEXEC_POSTFLAGS Flags to pass to MPIEXEC after all other flags.\n\n This module will attempt to auto-detect these settings, first by looking for a MPI compiler, which many MPI implementations provide as a pass-through to the native compiler to simplify the compilation of MPI programs. The MPI compiler is stored in the cache variable MPI_COMPILER, and will attempt to look for commonly-named drivers mpic++, mpicxx, mpiCC, or mpicc. If the compiler driver is found and recognized, it will be used to set all of the module variables. To skip this auto-detection, set MPI_LIBRARY and MPI_INCLUDE_PATH in the CMake cache.\n\n If no compiler driver is found or the compiler driver is not recognized, this module will then search for common include paths and library names to try to detect MPI.\n\n If CMake initially finds a different MPI than was intended, and you want to use the MPI compiler auto-detection for a different MPI implementation, set MPI_COMPILER to the MPI compiler driver you want to use (e.g., mpicxx) and then set MPI_LIBRARY to the string MPI_LIBRARY-NOTFOUND. When you re-configure, auto-detection of MPI will run again with the newly-specified MPI_COMPILER.\n\n When using MPIEXEC to execute MPI applications, you should typically use all of the MPIEXEC flags as follows:\n\n where PROCS is the number of processors on which to execute the program, EXECUTABLE is the MPI program, and ARGS are the arguments to pass to the MPI program.\n• : this module looks for Matlab\n\n MATLAB_INCLUDE_DIR: include path for mex.h, engine.h\n\n MATLAB_LIBRARIES: required libraries: libmex, etc\n\n MATLAB_MEX_LIBRARY: path to libmex.lib\n\n MATLAB_MX_LIBRARY: path to libmx.lib\n\n MATLAB_ENG_LIBRARY: path to libeng.lib\n• : Try to find Motif (or lesstif)\n\n Once done this will define:\n\n MOTIF_FOUND - system has MOTIF\n\n MOTIF_INCLUDE_DIR - include paths to use Motif\n\n MOTIF_LIBRARIES - Link these to use Motif\n• : \n\n Locate OpenAL This module defines OPENAL_LIBRARY OPENAL_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to OpenAL OPENAL_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find the headers\n\n $OPENALDIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$OPENALDIR used in building OpenAL.\n\n Created by Eric Wing.

If the compiler supports OpenMP, the flags required to compile with openmp support are set. \n\n The following variables are set:\n\n OpenMP_C_FLAGS - flags to add to the C compiler for OpenMP support\n\n OpenMP_CXX_FLAGS - flags to add to the CXX compiler for OpenMP support\n\n OPENMP_FOUND - true if openmp is detected\n\n Supported compilers can be found at http://openmp.org/wp/openmp-compilers/\n• : Try to find the OpenSSL encryption library\n\n Once done this will define\n\n OPENSSL_FOUND - system has the OpenSSL library\n\n OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR - the OpenSSL include directory\n\n OPENSSL_LIBRARIES - The libraries needed to use OpenSSL\n• : Find OpenSceneGraph\n\n This module searches for the OpenSceneGraph core \"osg\" library as well as OpenThreads, and whatever additional COMPONENTS (nodekits) that you specify.\n\n NOTE: To use this module effectively you must either require CMake >= 2.6.3 with cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.6.3) or download and place FindOpenThreads.cmake, Findosg_functions.cmake, Findosg.cmake, and Find<etc>.cmake files into your CMAKE_MODULE_PATH.\n\n This module accepts the following variables (note mixed case)\n\n The following environment variables are also respected for finding the OSG and it's various components. CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH can also be used for this (see find_library() CMake documentation).\n\n <MODULE>_DIR (where MODULE is of the form \"OSGVOLUME\" and there is a FindosgVolume.cmake file)\n\n OSG_DIR\n\n OSGDIR\n\n OSG_ROOT\n\n This module defines the following output variables:\n\n OPENSCENEGRAPH_FOUND - Was the OSG and all of the specified components found?\n\n OPENSCENEGRAPH_VERSION - The version of the OSG which was found\n\n OPENSCENEGRAPH_INCLUDE_DIRS - Where to find the headers\n• : \n\n OpenThreads is a C++ based threading library. Its largest userbase seems to OpenSceneGraph so you might notice I accept OSGDIR as an environment path. I consider this part of the Findosg* suite used to find OpenSceneGraph components. Each component is separate and you must opt in to each module.\n\n Locate OpenThreads This module defines OPENTHREADS_LIBRARY OPENTHREADS_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to OpenThreads OPENTHREADS_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find the headers\n\n $OPENTHREADS_DIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$OPENTHREADS_DIR used in building osg.\n• : Find PHP4\n\n This module finds if PHP4 is installed and determines where the include files and libraries are. It also determines what the name of the library is. This code sets the following variables:\n\n PHP4_INCLUDE_PATH = path to where php.h can be found\n\n PHP4_EXECUTABLE = full path to the php4 binary\n• : Find the native PNG includes and library\n\n PNG_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find png.h, etc.\n\n PNG_LIBRARIES, the libraries to link against to use PNG.\n\n PNG_DEFINITIONS - You should add_definitons(${PNG_DEFINITIONS}) before compiling code that includes png library files.\n\n PNG_FOUND, If false, do not try to use PNG.\n\n also defined, but not for general use are\n\n PNG_LIBRARY, where to find the PNG library.\n\n None of the above will be defined unles zlib can be found. PNG depends on Zlib\n• : \n\n This macro is intended to be used in FindXXX.cmake modules files.\n\n It handles the REQUIRED and QUIET argument to FIND_PACKAGE() and\n\n it also sets the <UPPERCASED_NAME>_FOUND variable.\n\n The package is found if all variables listed are TRUE.\n\n Example:\n\n LibXml2 is considered to be found, if both LIBXML2_LIBRARIES and \n\n LIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR are valid. Then also LIBXML2_FOUND is set to TRUE.\n\n If it is not found and REQUIRED was used, it fails with FATAL_ERROR, \n\n independent whether QUIET was used or not.\n\n If it is found, the location is reported using the VAR1 argument, so \n\n here a message \"Found LibXml2: /usr/lib/libxml2.so\" will be printed out.\n\n If the second argument is DEFAULT_MSG, the message in the failure case will \n\n be \"Could NOT find LibXml2\", if you don't like this message you can specify\n\n your own custom failure message there.\n• : \n\n This macro is intended to be used in FindXXX.cmake modules files. It will print a message once for each unique find result. This is useful for telling the user where a package was found. The first argument specifies the name (XXX) of the package. The second argument specifies the message to display. The third argument lists details about the find result so that if they change the message will be displayed again. The macro also obeys the QUIET argument to the find_package command.\n• : Find perl\n\n this module looks for Perl\n\n PERL_EXECUTABLE - the full path to perl\n\n PERL_FOUND - If false, don't attempt to use perl.\n• : Find Perl libraries\n\n This module finds if PERL is installed and determines where the include files and libraries are.

The second set contains flags which are given out when pkgconfig was called with the '--static' option.\n\n <XPREFIX>_LIBRARIES ... only the libraries (w/o the '-l')\n\n <XPREFIX>_LIBRARY_DIRS ... the paths of the libraries (w/o the '-L')\n\n <XPREFIX>_LDFLAGS ... all required linker flags\n\n <XPREFIX>_LDFLAGS_OTHER ... all other linker flags\n\n <XPREFIX>_INCLUDE_DIRS ... the '-I' preprocessor flags (w/o the '-I')\n\n <XPREFIX>_CFLAGS ... all required cflags\n\n <XPREFIX>_CFLAGS_OTHER ... the other compiler flags\n\n There are some special variables whose prefix depends on the count of given modules. When there is only one module, <PREFIX> stays unchanged.

You'll notice that I accept OSGDIR as an environment path.\n\n Each component is separate and you must opt in to each module. You must also opt into OpenGL (and OpenThreads?) as these modules won't do it for you. This is to allow you control over your own system piece by piece in case you need to opt out of certain components or change the Find behavior for a particular module (perhaps because the default FindOpenGL.cmake module doesn't work with your system as an example). If you want to use a more convenient module that includes everything, use the FindOpenSceneGraph.cmake instead of the Findosg*.cmake modules.\n\n Locate Producer This module defines PRODUCER_LIBRARY PRODUCER_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to Producer PRODUCER_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find the headers\n\n $PRODUCER_DIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$PRODUCER_DIR used in building osg.\n• : \n\n Locate and configure the Google Protocol Buffers library.

If not, you should just directly use FindQt4 or FindQt3. If multiple versions of QT are found on the machine, then The user must set the option DESIRED_QT_VERSION to the version they want to use. If only one version of qt is found on the machine, then the DESIRED_QT_VERSION is set to that version and the matching FindQt3 or FindQt4 module is included. Once the user sets DESIRED_QT_VERSION, then the FindQt3 or FindQt4 module is included.\n\n QT_REQUIRED if this is set to TRUE then if CMake can \n\n not find QT4 or QT3 an error is raised \n\n and a message is sent to the user.\n\n DESIRED_QT_VERSION OPTION is created\n\n QT4_INSTALLED is set to TRUE if qt4 is found.\n\n QT3_INSTALLED is set to TRUE if qt3 is found.\n• : Locate Qt include paths and libraries\n\n QT_INCLUDE_DIR - where to find qt.h, etc.\n\n QT_LIBRARIES - the libraries to link against to use Qt.\n\n QT_DEFINITIONS - definitions to use when\n\n compiling code that uses Qt.\n\n QT_FOUND - If false, don't try to use Qt.\n\n If you need the multithreaded version of Qt, set QT_MT_REQUIRED to TRUE\n\n Also defined, but not for general use are:\n\n QT_MOC_EXECUTABLE, where to find the moc tool.\n\n QT_UIC_EXECUTABLE, where to find the uic tool.\n\n QT_QT_LIBRARY, where to find the Qt library.\n\n QT_QTMAIN_LIBRARY, where to find the qtmain\n\n library. This is only required by Qt3 on Windows.\n• : Find QT 4\n\n This module can be used to find Qt4. The most important issue is that the Qt4 qmake is available via the system path. This qmake is then used to detect basically everything else. This module defines a number of key variables and macros. The variable QT_USE_FILE is set which is the path to a CMake file that can be included to compile Qt 4 applications and libraries. It sets up the compilation environment for include directories, preprocessor defines and populates a QT_LIBRARIES variable.\n\n Typical usage could be something like:\n\n The minimum required version can be specified using the standard find_package()-syntax (see example above). For compatibility with older versions of FindQt4.cmake it is also possible to set the variable QT_MIN_VERSION to the minimum required version of Qt4 before the find_package(Qt4) command. If both are used, the version used in the find_package() command overrides the one from QT_MIN_VERSION.\n\n When using the components argument, QT_USE_QT* variables are automatically set for the QT_USE_FILE to pick up. If one wishes to manually set them, the available ones to set include:\n\n QT_USE_IMPORTED_TARGETS \n\n If this variable is set to TRUE, FindQt4.cmake will create imported\n\n library targets for the various Qt libraries and set the \n\n library variables like QT_QTCORE_LIBRARY to point at these imported\n\n targets instead of the library file on disk. This provides much better \n\n handling of the release and debug versions of the Qt libraries and is \n\n also always backwards compatible, except for the case that dependencies\n\n of libraries are exported, these will then also list the names of the \n\n imported targets as dependency and not the file location on disk. This\n\n is much more flexible, but requires that FindQt4.cmake is executed before\n\n such an exported dependency file is processed.\n\n There are also some files that need processing by some Qt tools such as moc and uic. Listed below are macros that may be used to process those files.\n\n \n\n macro QT4_WRAP_CPP(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS ...)\n\n create moc code from a list of files containing Qt class with\n\n the Q_OBJECT declaration. Per-direcotry preprocessor definitions \n\n are also added. Options may be given to moc, such as those found\n\n when executing \"moc -help\". \n\n macro QT4_WRAP_UI(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS ...)\n\n create code from a list of Qt designer ui files.\n\n Options may be given to uic, such as those found\n\n when executing \"uic -help\"\n\n macro QT4_ADD_RESOURCES(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS ...)\n\n create code from a list of Qt resource files.\n\n Options may be given to rcc, such as those found\n\n when executing \"rcc -help\"\n\n macro QT4_GENERATE_MOC(inputfile outputfile )\n\n creates a rule to run moc on infile and create outfile.\n\n Use this if for some reason QT4_WRAP_CPP() isn't appropriate, e.g.\n\n because you need a custom filename for the moc file or something similar.\n\n macro QT4_AUTOMOC(sourcefile1 sourcefile2 ... )\n\n This macro is still experimental.\n\n It can be used to have moc automatically handled.\n\n So if you have the files foo.h and foo.cpp, and in foo.h a \n\n a class uses the Q_OBJECT macro, moc has to run on it. If you don't\n\n want to use QT4_WRAP_CPP() (which is reliable and mature), you can insert\n\n #include \"foo.moc\"\n\n in foo.cpp and then give foo.cpp as argument to QT4_AUTOMOC().

Ruby 1.8 and 1.9 are supported. The minimum required version specified in the find_package() command is honored. It also determines what the name of the library is. This code sets the following variables:\n\n RUBY_EXECUTABLE = full path to the ruby binary\n\n RUBY_INCLUDE_DIRS = include dirs to be used when using the ruby library\n\n RUBY_LIBRARY = full path to the ruby library\n\n RUBY_VERSION = the version of ruby which was found, e.g. \"1.8.7\"\n\n RUBY_FOUND = set to true if ruby ws found successfully\n\n RUBY_INCLUDE_PATH = same as RUBY_INCLUDE_DIRS, only provided for compatibility reasons, don't use it\n• : \n\n Locate SDL library This module defines SDL_LIBRARY, the name of the library to link against SDL_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL SDL_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL.h\n\n This module responds to the the flag: SDL_BUILDING_LIBRARY If this is defined, then no SDL_main will be linked in because only applications need main(). Otherwise, it is assumed you are building an application and this module will attempt to locate and set the the proper link flags as part of the returned SDL_LIBRARY variable.\n\n Don't forget to include SDLmain.h and SDLmain.m your project for the OS X framework based version. (Other versions link to -lSDLmain which this module will try to find on your behalf.) Also for OS X, this module will automatically add the -framework Cocoa on your behalf.\n\n Additional Note: If you see an empty SDL_LIBRARY_TEMP in your configuration and no SDL_LIBRARY, it means CMake did not find your SDL library (SDL.dll, libsdl.so, SDL.framework, etc). Set SDL_LIBRARY_TEMP to point to your SDL library, and configure again. Similarly, if you see an empty SDLMAIN_LIBRARY, you should set this value as appropriate. These values are used to generate the final SDL_LIBRARY variable, but when these values are unset, SDL_LIBRARY does not get created.\n\n $SDLDIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR used in building SDL. l.e.galup 9-20-02\n\n Modified by Eric Wing. Added code to assist with automated building by using environmental variables and providing a more controlled/consistent search behavior. Added new modifications to recognize OS X frameworks and additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc). Also corrected the header search path to follow \"proper\" SDL guidelines. Added a search for SDLmain which is needed by some platforms. Added a search for threads which is needed by some platforms. Added needed compile switches for MinGW.\n\n On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if found) over others. People will have to manually change the cache values of SDL_LIBRARY to override this selection or set the CMake environment CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to modify the search paths.\n\n Note that the header path has changed from SDL/SDL.h to just SDL.h This needed to change because \"proper\" SDL convention is #include \"SDL.h\", not <SDL/SDL.h>. This is done for portability reasons because not all systems place things in SDL/ (see FreeBSD).\n• : \n\n Locate SDL_image library This module defines SDLIMAGE_LIBRARY, the name of the library to link against SDLIMAGE_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL SDLIMAGE_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL/SDL.h\n\n $SDLDIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR used in building SDL.\n\n Created by Eric Wing.

Changes compared to CMake 2.4 are:\n\n => they were only useful for people writing Tcl/Tk extensions.\n\n => these libs are not packaged by default with Tcl/Tk distributions. \n\n Even when Tcl/Tk is built from source, several flavors of debug libs\n\n are created and there is no real reason to pick a single one\n\n specifically (say, amongst tcl84g, tcl84gs, or tcl84sgx). \n\n Let's leave that choice to the user by allowing him to assign \n\n TCL_LIBRARY to any Tcl library, debug or not.\n\n => this ended up being only a Win32 variable, and there is a lot of\n\n confusion regarding the location of this file in an installed Tcl/Tk\n\n tree anyway (see 8.5 for example). If you need the internal path at\n\n this point it is safer you ask directly where the *source* tree is\n\n and dig from there.\n• : Find TIFF library\n\n Find the native TIFF includes and library This module defines\n\n TIFF_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find tiff.h, etc.\n\n TIFF_LIBRARIES, libraries to link against to use TIFF.\n\n TIFF_FOUND, If false, do not try to use TIFF.\n\n also defined, but not for general use are\n\n TIFF_LIBRARY, where to find the TIFF library.\n• : TCL_STUB_LIBRARY_DEBUG and TK_STUB_LIBRARY_DEBUG were removed.\n\n This module finds Tcl stub libraries.

To specify the modules that you will use, you need to name them as components to the package:\n\n There are two search branches: a windows style and a unix style. For windows, the following variables are searched for and set to defaults in case of multiple choices. Change them if the defaults are not desired (i.e., these are the only variables you should change to select a configuration):\n\n For unix style it uses the wx-config utility. You can select between debug/release, unicode/ansi, universal/non-universal, and static/shared in the QtDialog or ccmake interfaces by turning ON/OFF the following variables:\n\n The following are set after the configuration is done for both windows and unix style:\n\n wxWidgets_FOUND - Set to TRUE if wxWidgets was found.\n\n wxWidgets_INCLUDE_DIRS - Include directories for WIN32\n\n i.e., where to find \"wx/wx.h\" and\n\n \"wx/setup.h\"; possibly empty for unices.\n\n wxWidgets_LIBRARIES - Path to the wxWidgets libraries.\n\n wxWidgets_LIBRARY_DIRS - compile time link dirs, useful for\n\n rpath on UNIX. Typically an empty string\n\n in WIN32 environment.\n\n wxWidgets_DEFINITIONS - Contains defines required to compile/link\n\n against WX, e.g. WXUSINGDLL\n\n wxWidgets_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG- Contains defines required to compile/link\n\n against WX debug builds, e.g. __WXDEBUG__\n\n wxWidgets_CXX_FLAGS - Include dirs and compiler flags for\n\n unices, empty on WIN32.

It also determines what the name of the library is. Please note this file is DEPRECATED and replaced by FindwxWidgets.cmake. This code sets the following variables:\n\n WXWINDOWS_FOUND = system has WxWindows\n\n WXWINDOWS_LIBRARIES = path to the wxWindows libraries\n\n on Unix/Linux with additional\n\n linker flags from\n\n \"wx-config --libs\"\n\n CMAKE_WXWINDOWS_CXX_FLAGS = Compiler flags for wxWindows,\n\n essentially \"`wx-config --cxxflags`\"\n\n on Linux\n\n WXWINDOWS_INCLUDE_DIR = where to find \"wx/wx.h\" and \"wx/setup.h\"\n\n WXWINDOWS_LINK_DIRECTORIES = link directories, useful for rpath on\n\n Unix\n\n WXWINDOWS_DEFINITIONS = extra defines\n\n OPTIONS If you need OpenGL support please\n\n in your CMakeLists.txt *before* you include this file.\n\n HAVE_ISYSTEM - true required to replace -I by -isystem on g++\n\n For convenience include Use_wxWindows.cmake in your project's CMakeLists.txt using INCLUDE(Use_wxWindows).\n\n NOTES wxWidgets 2.6.x is supported for monolithic builds e.g. compiled in wx/build/msw dir as:\n• : Fortran/C Interface Detection\n\n This module automatically detects the API by which C and Fortran languages interact. Variables indicate if the mangling is found:\n\n FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_FOUND = Global subroutines and functions\n\n FortranCInterface_MODULE_FOUND = Module subroutines and functions\n\n (declared by \"MODULE PROCEDURE\")\n\n A function is provided to generate a C header file containing macros to mangle symbol names:\n\n It generates in <file> definitions of the following macros:\n\n These macros mangle four categories of Fortran symbols, respectively:\n\n - Global symbols without '_': call mysub()\n\n - Global symbols with '_' : call my_sub()\n\n - Module symbols without '_': use mymod; call mysub()\n\n - Module symbols with '_' : use mymod; call my_sub()\n\n If mangling for a category is not known, its macro is left undefined. All macros require raw names in both lower case and upper case. The MACRO_NAMESPACE option replaces the default \"FortranCInterface_\" prefix with a given namespace \"<macro-ns>\".\n\n The SYMBOLS option lists symbols to mangle automatically with C preprocessor definitions:\n\n If the mangling for some symbol is not known then no preprocessor definition is created, and a warning is displayed. The SYMBOL_NAMESPACE option prefixes all preprocessor definitions generated by the SYMBOLS option with a given namespace \"<ns>\".\n\n This creates a \"FC.h\" header that defines mangling macros FC_GLOBAL(), FC_GLOBAL_(), FC_MODULE(), and FC_MODULE_().\n\n This creates a \"FC.h\" header that defines the same FC_*() mangling macros as the previous example plus preprocessor symbols FC_mysub and FC_mymod_my_sub.\n\n Another function is provided to verify that the Fortran and C/C++ compilers work together:\n\n It tests whether a simple test executable using Fortran and C (and C++ when the CXX option is given) compiles and links successfully. The result is stored in the cache entry FortranCInterface_VERIFIED_C (or FortranCInterface_VERIFIED_CXX if CXX is given) as a boolean. If the check fails and QUIET is not given the function terminates with a FATAL_ERROR message describing the problem. The purpose of this check is to stop a build early for incompatible compiler combinations.\n\n FortranCInterface is aware of possible GLOBAL and MODULE manglings for many Fortran compilers, but it also provides an interface to specify new possible manglings. Set the variables\n\n before including FortranCInterface to specify manglings of the symbols \"MySub\", \"My_Sub\", \"MyModule:MySub\", and \"My_Module:My_Sub\". For example, the code:\n\n tells FortranCInterface to try given GLOBAL and MODULE manglings. (The carets point at raw symbol names for clarity in this example but are not needed.)\n• : \n\n This script provides functions to list the .dll, .dylib or .so files that an executable or shared library file depends on.

If only basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG is defined, then basename_LIBRARY, basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG and basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE will take the debug value. \n\n If the generator supports configuration types, then basename_LIBRARY and basename_LIBRARIES will be set with debug and optimized flags specifying the library to be used for the given configuration. If no build type has been set or the generator in use does not support configuration types, then basename_LIBRARY and basename_LIBRARIES will take only the release values.\n• : \n\n This script launches a GUI test using Squish.

It is assumed that FindQt.cmake has already been loaded. See FindQt.cmake for information on how to load Qt 4 into your CMake project.\n• : SWIG module for CMake\n\n SWIG_ADD_MODULE(name language [ files ])\n\n - Define swig module with given name and specified language\n\n SWIG_LINK_LIBRARIES(name [ libraries ])\n\n - Link libraries to swig module\n\n All other macros are for internal use only. To get the actual name of the swig module, use: ${SWIG_MODULE_${name}_REAL_NAME}. Set Source files properties such as CPLUSPLUS and SWIG_FLAGS to specify special behavior of SWIG. Also global CMAKE_SWIG_FLAGS can be used to add special flags to all swig calls. Another special variable is CMAKE_SWIG_OUTDIR, it allows one to specify where to write all the swig generated module (swig -outdir option) The name-specific variable SWIG_MODULE_<name>_EXTRA_DEPS may be used to specify extra dependencies for the generated modules. If the source file generated by swig need some special flag you can use SET_SOURCE_FILES_PROPERTIES( ${swig_generated_file_fullname}\n• : ---------------------------------------------------\n\n This convenience include finds if wxWindows is installed and set the appropriate libs, incdirs, flags etc. author Jan Woetzel <jw -at- mip.informatik.uni-kiel.de> (07/2003)\n\n just include Use_wxWindows.cmake\n\n in your projects CMakeLists.txt\n\n if you are sure you need GL then\n\n *before* you include this file.\n• : Convenience include for using wxWidgets library\n\n Finds if wxWidgets is installed and set the appropriate libs, incdirs, flags etc. INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, LINK_DIRECTORIES and ADD_DEFINITIONS are called.\n\n SET( wxWidgets_USE_LIBS gl xml xrc ) # optionally: more than wx std libs\n\n FIND_PACKAGE(wxWidgets REQUIRED)\n\n INCLUDE( ${xWidgets_USE_FILE} )\n\n ... add your targets here, e.g. ADD_EXECUTABLE/ ADD_LIBRARY ...\n\n TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIERS( <yourWxDependantTarget> ${wxWidgets_LIBRARIES})\n\n LINK_LIBRARIES is not called in favor of adding dependencies per target.\n• : A minimum required CMake version must be specified.\n\n CMake requires that projects specify the version of CMake to which they have been written. This policy has been put in place so users trying to build the project may be told when they need to update their CMake. Specifying a version also helps the project build with CMake versions newer than that specified. Use the cmake_minimum_required command at the top of your main CMakeLists.txt file:\n\n where \"<major>.<minor>\" is the version of CMake you want to support (such as \"2.6\"). The command will ensure that at least the given version of CMake is running and help newer versions be compatible with the project. See documentation of cmake_minimum_required for details.\n\n Note that the command invocation must appear in the CMakeLists.txt file itself; a call in an included file is not sufficient. However, the cmake_policy command may be called to set policy CMP0000 to OLD or NEW behavior explicitly. The OLD behavior is to silently ignore the missing invocation. The NEW behavior is to issue an error instead of a warning. An included file may set CMP0000 explicitly to affect how this policy is enforced for the main CMakeLists.txt file.\n\n This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0.\n• : CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY should no longer be used.\n\n The OLD behavior is to check CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY and present it to the user. The NEW behavior is to ignore CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY completely.\n\n In CMake 2.4 and below the variable CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY was used to request compatibility with earlier versions of CMake. In CMake 2.6 and above all compatibility issues are handled by policies and the cmake_policy command. However, CMake must still check CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY for projects written for CMake 2.4 and below.\n\n This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0. CMake version 2.8.1 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.\n• : Logical target names must be globally unique.\n\n Targets names created with add_executable, add_library, or add_custom_target are logical build target names. Logical target names must be globally unique because:\n\n - Unique names may be referenced unambiguously both in CMake\n\n code and on make tool command lines.\n\n - Logical names are used by Xcode and VS IDE generators\n\n to produce meaningful project names for the targets.\n\n The logical name of executable and library targets does not have to correspond to the physical file names built. Consider using the OUTPUT_NAME target property to create two targets with the same physical name while keeping logical names distinct. Custom targets must simply have globally unique names (unless one uses the global property ALLOW_DUPLICATE_CUSTOM_TARGETS with a Makefiles generator).\n\n This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0. CMake version 2.8.1 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.\n• : Libraries linked via full path no longer produce linker search paths.\n\n This policy affects how libraries whose full paths are NOT known are found at link time, but was created due to a change in how CMake deals with libraries whose full paths are known. Consider the code\n\n CMake 2.4 and below implemented linking to libraries whose full paths are known by splitting them on the link line into separate components consisting of the linker search path and the library name. The example code might have produced something like\n\n in order to link to library A. An analysis was performed to order multiple link directories such that the linker would find library A in the desired location, but there are cases in which this does not work. CMake versions 2.6 and above use the more reliable approach of passing the full path to libraries directly to the linker in most cases. The example code now produces something like\n\n Unfortunately this change can break code like\n\n where \"B\" is meant to find \"/path/to/libB.so\". This code is wrong because the user is asking the linker to find library B but has not provided a linker search path (which may be added with the link_directories command). However, with the old linking implementation the code would work accidentally because the linker search path added for library A allowed library B to be found.\n\n In order to support projects depending on linker search paths added by linking to libraries with known full paths, the OLD behavior for this policy will add the linker search paths even though they are not needed for their own libraries. When this policy is set to OLD, CMake will produce a link line such as\n\n which will allow library B to be found as it was previously. When this policy is set to NEW, CMake will produce a link line such as\n\n which more accurately matches what the project specified.\n\n The setting for this policy used when generating the link line is that in effect when the target is created by an add_executable or add_library command. For the example described above, the code\n\n will work and suppress the warning for this policy. It may also be updated to work with the corrected linking approach:\n\n cmake_policy(SET CMP0003 NEW) # or cmake_policy(VERSION 2.6)\n\n link_directories(/path/to) # needed to find library B\n\n add_executable(myexe myexe.c)\n\n target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so B)\n\n Even better, library B may be specified with a full path:\n\n When all items on the link line have known paths CMake does not check this policy so it has no effect.\n\n Note that the warning for this policy will be issued for at most one target. This avoids flooding users with messages for every target when setting the policy once will probably fix all targets.\n\n This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0. CMake version 2.8.1 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.\n• : Libraries linked may not have leading or trailing whitespace.\n\n CMake versions 2.4 and below silently removed leading and trailing whitespace from libraries linked with code like\n\n This could lead to subtle errors in user projects.\n\n The OLD behavior for this policy is to silently remove leading and trailing whitespace. The NEW behavior for this policy is to diagnose the existence of such whitespace as an error. The setting for this policy used when checking the library names is that in effect when the target is created by an add_executable or add_library command.\n\n This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0. CMake version 2.8.1 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.\n• : Preprocessor definition values are now escaped automatically.\n\n This policy determines whether or not CMake should generate escaped preprocessor definition values added via add_definitions. CMake versions 2.4 and below assumed that only trivial values would be given for macros in add_definitions calls. It did not attempt to escape non-trivial values such as string literals in generated build rules. CMake versions 2.6 and above support escaping of most values, but cannot assume the user has not added escapes already in an attempt to work around limitations in earlier versions.\n\n The OLD behavior for this policy is to place definition values given to add_definitions directly in the generated build rules without attempting to escape anything. The NEW behavior for this policy is to generate correct escapes for all native build tools automatically. See documentation of the COMPILE_DEFINITIONS target property for limitations of the escaping implementation.\n\n This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0. CMake version 2.8.1 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.\n• : Installing MACOSX_BUNDLE targets requires a BUNDLE DESTINATION.\n\n This policy determines whether the install(TARGETS) command must be given a BUNDLE DESTINATION when asked to install a target with the MACOSX_BUNDLE property set. CMake 2.4 and below did not distinguish application bundles from normal executables when installing targets. CMake 2.6 provides a BUNDLE option to the install(TARGETS) command that specifies rules specific to application bundles on the Mac. Projects should use this option when installing a target with the MACOSX_BUNDLE property set.\n\n The OLD behavior for this policy is to fall back to the RUNTIME DESTINATION if a BUNDLE DESTINATION is not given. The NEW behavior for this policy is to produce an error if a bundle target is installed without a BUNDLE DESTINATION.\n\n This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0. CMake version 2.8.1 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.\n• : list command no longer ignores empty elements.\n\n This policy determines whether the list command will ignore empty elements in the list. CMake 2.4 and below list commands ignored all empty elements in the list. For example, a;b;;c would have length 3 and not 4. The OLD behavior for this policy is to ignore empty list elements. The NEW behavior for this policy is to correctly count empty elements in a list. \n\n This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0. CMake version 2.8.1 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.\n• : Libraries linked by full-path must have a valid library file name.\n\n In CMake 2.4 and below it is possible to write code like\n\n where \"somelib\" is supposed to be a valid library file name such as \"libsomelib.a\" or \"somelib.lib\". For Makefile generators this produces an error at build time because the dependency on the full path cannot be found. For VS IDE and Xcode generators this used to work by accident because CMake would always split off the library directory and ask the linker to search for the library by name (-lsomelib or somelib.lib). Despite the failure with Makefiles, some projects have code like this and build only with VS and/or Xcode. This version of CMake prefers to pass the full path directly to the native build tool, which will fail in this case because it does not name a valid library file.\n\n This policy determines what to do with full paths that do not appear to name a valid library file. The OLD behavior for this policy is to split the library name from the path and ask the linker to search for it. The NEW behavior for this policy is to trust the given path and pass it directly to the native build tool unchanged.\n\n This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.1. CMake version 2.8.1 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.\n• : FILE GLOB_RECURSE calls should not follow symlinks by default.\n\n In CMake 2.6.1 and below, FILE GLOB_RECURSE calls would follow through symlinks, sometimes coming up with unexpectedly large result sets because of symlinks to top level directories that contain hundreds of thousands of files.\n\n This policy determines whether or not to follow symlinks encountered during a FILE GLOB_RECURSE call. The OLD behavior for this policy is to follow the symlinks. The NEW behavior for this policy is not to follow the symlinks by default, but only if FOLLOW_SYMLINKS is given as an additional argument to the FILE command.\n\n This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.2. CMake version 2.8.1 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.\n• : Bad variable reference syntax is an error.\n\n In CMake 2.6.2 and below, incorrect variable reference syntax such as a missing close-brace (\"${FOO\") was reported but did not stop processing of CMake code. This policy determines whether a bad variable reference is an error. The OLD behavior for this policy is to warn about the error, leave the string untouched, and continue. The NEW behavior for this policy is to report an error.\n\n This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.3. CMake version 2.8.1 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.\n• : Included scripts do automatic cmake_policy PUSH and POP.\n\n In CMake 2.6.2 and below, CMake Policy settings in scripts loaded by the include() and find_package() commands would affect the includer. Explicit invocations of cmake_policy(PUSH) and cmake_policy(POP) were required to isolate policy changes and protect the includer. While some scripts intend to affect the policies of their includer, most do not. In CMake 2.6.3 and above, include() and find_package() by default PUSH and POP an entry on the policy stack around an included script, but provide a NO_POLICY_SCOPE option to disable it. This policy determines whether or not to imply NO_POLICY_SCOPE for compatibility. The OLD behavior for this policy is to imply NO_POLICY_SCOPE for include() and find_package() commands. The NEW behavior for this policy is to allow the commands to do their default cmake_policy PUSH and POP.\n\n This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.3. CMake version 2.8.1 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.\n• : if() recognizes numbers and boolean constants.\n\n In CMake versions 2.6.4 and lower the if() command implicitly dereferenced arguments corresponding to variables, even those named like numbers or boolean constants, except for 0 and 1. Numbers and boolean constants such as true, false, yes, no, on, off, y, n, notfound, ignore (all case insensitive) were recognized in some cases but not all. For example, the code \"if(TRUE)\" might have evaluated as false. Numbers such as 2 were recognized only in boolean expressions like \"if(NOT 2)\" (leading to false) but not as a single-argument like \"if(2)\" (also leading to false). Later versions of CMake prefer to treat numbers and boolean constants literally, so they should not be used as variable names.\n\n The OLD behavior for this policy is to implicitly dereference variables named like numbers and boolean constants. The NEW behavior for this policy is to recognize numbers and boolean constants without dereferencing variables with such names.\n\n This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.0. CMake version 2.8.1 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.\n• : Duplicate binary directories are not allowed.\n\n CMake 2.6.3 and below silently permitted add_subdirectory() calls to create the same binary directory multiple times. During build system generation files would be written and then overwritten in the build tree and could lead to strange behavior. CMake 2.6.4 and above explicitly detect duplicate binary directories. CMake 2.6.4 always considers this case an error. In CMake 2.8.0 and above this policy determines whether or not the case is an error. The OLD behavior for this policy is to allow duplicate binary directories. The NEW behavior for this policy is to disallow duplicate binary directories with an error.\n\n This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.0. CMake version 2.8.1 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.\n• : Input directories must have CMakeLists.txt.\n\n CMake versions before 2.8 silently ignored missing CMakeLists.txt files in directories referenced by add_subdirectory() or subdirs(), treating them as if present but empty. In CMake 2.8.0 and above this policy determines whether or not the case is an error. The OLD behavior for this policy is to silently ignore the problem. The NEW behavior for this policy is to report an error.\n\n This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.0. CMake version 2.8.1 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.\n• : link_directories() treats paths relative to the source dir.\n\n In CMake 2.6.4 and lower the link_directories() command passed relative paths unchanged to the linker. In CMake 2.8.1 and above the link_directories() command prefers to interpret relative paths with respect to CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR, which is consistent with include_directories() and other commands. The OLD behavior for this policy is to use relative paths verbatim in the linker command. The NEW behavior for this policy is to convert relative paths to absolute paths by appending the relative path to CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR.\n\n This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.1. CMake version 2.8.1 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.\n• : Global flag to cause add_library to create shared libraries if on.\n\n If present and true, this will cause all libraries to be built shared unless the library was explicitly added as a static library. This variable is often added to projects as an OPTION so that each user of a project can decide if they want to build the project using shared or static libraries.\n• : Version of cmake required to build project\n\n From the point of view of backwards compatibility, this specifies what version of CMake should be supported. By default this value is the version number of CMake that you are running. You can set this to an older version of CMake to support deprecated commands of CMake in projects that were written to use older versions of CMake. This can be set by the user or set at the beginning of a CMakeLists file.\n• : Specifies the build type for make based generators.\n\n This specifies what build type will be built in this tree. Possible values are empty, Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo and MinSizeRel. This variable is only supported for make based generators. If this variable is supported, then CMake will also provide initial values for the variables with the name CMAKE_C_FLAGS_[Debug|Release|RelWithDebInfo|MinSizeRel]. For example, if CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is Debug, then CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG will be added to the CMAKE_C_FLAGS.\n• : Enables color output when using the Makefile generator.\n\n When enabled, the generated Makefiles will produce colored output. Default is ON.\n• : Specifies the available build types.\n\n This specifies what build types will be available such as Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo etc. This has reasonable defaults on most platforms. But can be extended to provide other build types. See also CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.\n• : Prefixes to prepend when looking for libraries.\n\n This specifies what prefixes to add to library names when the find_library command looks for libraries. On UNIX systems this is typically lib, meaning that when trying to find the foo library it will look for libfoo.\n• : Suffixes to append when looking for libraries.\n\n This specifies what suffixes to add to library names when the find_library command looks for libraries. On Windows systems this is typically .lib and .dll, meaning that when trying to find the foo library it will look for foo.dll etc.\n• : Path used for searching by FIND_FILE() and FIND_PATH().\n\n Specifies a path which will be used both by FIND_FILE() and FIND_PATH(). Both commands will check each of the contained directories for the existence of the file which is currently searched. By default it is empty, it is intended to be set by the project. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.\n• : Install directory used by install.\n\n If \"make install\" is invoked or INSTALL is built, this directory is pre-pended onto all install directories. This variable defaults to /usr/local on UNIX and c:/Program Files on Windows.\n• : Path used for searching by FIND_LIBRARY().\n\n Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_LIBRARY(). FIND_LIBRARY() will check each of the contained directories for the existence of the library which is currently searched. By default it is empty, it is intended to be set by the project. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH, CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.\n• : Tell cmake to use MFC for an executable or dll.\n\n This can be set in a CMakeLists.txt file and will enable MFC in the application. It should be set to 1 for static the static MFC library, and 2 for the shared MFC library. This is used in visual studio 6 and 7 project files. The CMakeSetup dialog used MFC and the CMakeLists.txt looks like this:\n• : List of directories to search for CMake modules.\n\n Commands like include() and find_package() search for files in directories listed by this variable before checking the default modules that come with CMake.\n• : Skip _BUILD_TYPE flags if true.\n\n This is an internal flag used by the generators in CMake to tell CMake to skip the _BUILD_TYPE flags.\n• : Path used for searching by FIND_XXX(), with appropriate suffixes added.\n\n Specifies a path which will be used by the FIND_XXX() commands. It contains the \"base\" directories, the FIND_XXX() commands append appropriate subdirectories to the base directories. So FIND_PROGRAM() adds /bin to each of the directories in the path, FIND_LIBRARY() appends /lib to each of the directories, and FIND_PATH() and FIND_FILE() append /include . By default it is empty, it is intended to be set by the project. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH, CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH, CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH.\n• : Path used for searching by FIND_PROGRAM().\n\n Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_PROGRAM(). FIND_PROGRAM() will check each of the contained directories for the existence of the program which is currently searched. By default it is empty, it is intended to be set by the project. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH, CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.\n• : Don't make the install target depend on the all target.\n\n By default, the \"install\" target depends on the \"all\" target. This has the effect, that when \"make install\" is invoked or INSTALL is built, first the \"all\" target is built, then the installation starts. If CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY is set to TRUE, this dependency is not created, so the installation process will start immediately, independent from whether the project has been completely built or not.\n• : Path used for searching by FIND_FILE() and FIND_PATH().\n\n Specifies a path which will be used both by FIND_FILE() and FIND_PATH(). Both commands will check each of the contained directories for the existence of the file which is currently searched. By default it contains the standard directories for the current system. It is NOT intended to be modified by the project, use CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH for this. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH.\n• : Path used for searching by FIND_LIBRARY().\n\n Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_LIBRARY(). FIND_LIBRARY() will check each of the contained directories for the existence of the library which is currently searched. By default it contains the standard directories for the current system. It is NOT intended to be modified by the project, use CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH for this. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH.\n• : Path used for searching by FIND_XXX(), with appropriate suffixes added.\n\n Specifies a path which will be used by the FIND_XXX() commands. It contains the \"base\" directories, the FIND_XXX() commands append appropriate subdirectories to the base directories. So FIND_PROGRAM() adds /bin to each of the directories in the path, FIND_LIBRARY() appends /lib to each of the directories, and FIND_PATH() and FIND_FILE() append /include . By default this contains the standard directories for the current system. It is NOT intended to be modified by the project, use CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH for this. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH, CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH.\n• : Path used for searching by FIND_PROGRAM().\n\n Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_PROGRAM(). FIND_PROGRAM() will check each of the contained directories for the existence of the program which is currently searched. By default it contains the standard directories for the current system. It is NOT intended to be modified by the project, use CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH for this. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH.\n• : Specify a file that can change the build rule variables.\n\n If this variable is set, it should to point to a CMakeLists.txt file that will be read in by CMake after all the system settings have been set, but before they have been used. This would allow you to override any variables that need to be changed for some special project.\n• : True of the borland compiler is being used.\n\n This is set to true if the Borland compiler is being used.\n• : Using the 64 bit compiler from Microsoft\n\n Set to true when using the 64 bit cl compiler from Microsoft.\n• : Using the Visual Studio 2005 compiler from Microsoft\n\n Set to true when using the Visual Studio 2005 compiler from Microsoft.\n• : True for Apple OSXoperating systems.\n\n Set to true when the host system is Apple OSX.\n• : Name of system cmake is being run on.\n\n The same as CMAKE_SYSTEM but for the host system instead of the target system when cross compiling.\n• : Name of the OS CMake is running on.\n\n The same as CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME but for the host system instead of the target system when cross compiling.\n• : The name of the CPU CMake is running on.\n\n The same as CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR but for the host system instead of the target system when cross compiling.\n• : OS version CMake is running on.\n\n The same as CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION but for the host system instead of the target system when cross compiling.\n• : True for UNIX and UNIX like operating systems.\n\n Set to true when the host system is UNIX or UNIX like (i.e. APPLE and CYGWIN).\n• : True on windows systems, including win64.\n\n Set to true when the host system is Windows and on cygwin.\n• : Maximum object file full-path length allowed by native build tools.\n\n CMake computes for every source file an object file name that is unique to the source file and deterministic with respect to the full path to the source file. This allows multiple source files in a target to share the same name if they lie in different directories without rebuilding when one is added or removed. However, it can produce long full paths in a few cases, so CMake shortens the path using a hashing scheme when the full path to an object file exceeds a limit. CMake has a built-in limit for each platform that is sufficient for common tools, but some native tools may have a lower limit. This variable may be set to specify the limit explicitly. The value must be an integer no less than 128.\n• : Name of system cmake is compiling for.\n\n This variable is the composite of CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME and CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION, like this ${CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME}-${CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION}. If CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION is not set, then CMAKE_SYSTEM is the same as CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME.\n• : Name of the OS CMake is building for.\n\n This is the name of the operating system on which CMake is targeting. On systems that have the uname command, this variable is set to the output of uname -s. Linux, Windows, and Darwin for Mac OSX are the values found on the big three operating systems.\n• : The name of the CPU CMake is building for.\n\n On systems that support uname, this variable is set to the output of uname -p, on windows it is set to the value of the environment variable PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE\n• : OS version CMake is building for.\n\n A numeric version string for the system, on systems that support uname, this variable is set to the output of uname -r. On other systems this is set to major-minor version numbers.\n• : True for cygwin.\n\n Set to true when using CYGWIN.\n• : True when using Microsoft Visual C\n\n Set to true when the compiler is some version of Microsoft Visual C.\n• : True when using Microsoft Visual C 8.0\n\n Set to true when the compiler is version 8.0 of Microsoft Visual C.\n• : True when using the Microsoft Visual C IDE\n\n Set to true when the target platform is the Microsoft Visual C IDE, as opposed to the command line compiler.\n• : The version of Microsoft Visual C/C++ being used if any.\n\n The version of Microsoft Visual C/C++ being used if any. For example 1300 is MSVC 6.0.\n• : True for UNIX and UNIX like operating systems.\n\n Set to true when the target system is UNIX or UNIX like (i.e. APPLE and CYGWIN).\n• : True on windows systems, including win64.\n\n Set to true when the target system is Windows and on cygwin.\n• : Version of Xcode (Xcode generator only).\n\n Under the Xcode generator, this is the version of Xcode as specified in \"Xcode.app/Contents/version.plist\" (such as \"3.1.2\").\n• : Rule variable to append to a static archive.\n\n This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to append to a static archive. It is used in place of CMAKE_<LANG>_CREATE_STATIC_LIBRARY on some platforms in order to support large object counts. See also CMAKE_<LANG>_ARCHIVE_CREATE and CMAKE_<LANG>_ARCHIVE_FINISH.\n• : Rule variable to create a new static archive.\n\n This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to create a static archive. It is used in place of CMAKE_<LANG>_CREATE_STATIC_LIBRARY on some platforms in order to support large object counts. See also CMAKE_<LANG>_ARCHIVE_APPEND and CMAKE_<LANG>_ARCHIVE_FINISH.\n• : Rule variable to finish an existing static archive.\n\n This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to finish a static archive. It is used in place of CMAKE_<LANG>_CREATE_STATIC_LIBRARY on some platforms in order to support large object counts. See also CMAKE_<LANG>_ARCHIVE_CREATE and CMAKE_<LANG>_ARCHIVE_APPEND.\n• : The full path to the compiler for LANG.\n\n This is the command that will be used as the <LANG> compiler. Once set, you can not change this variable.\n• : An internal variable subject to change.\n\n This is used in determining the compiler ABI and is subject to change.\n• : An internal variable subject to change.\n\n This is used in determining the compiler and is subject to change.\n• : Defined to true if the language is enabled.\n\n When language <LANG> is enabled by project() or enable_language() this variable is defined to 1.\n• : Rule variable to compile a single object file.\n\n This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to compile a single object file for for the language <LANG>.\n• : Rule variable to create a shared library.\n\n This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to create a shared library for the language <LANG>.\n• : Rule variable to create a shared module.\n\n This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to create a shared library for the language <LANG>.\n• : Rule variable to create a static library.\n\n This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to create a static library for the language <LANG>.\n• : Flags for Debug build type or configuration.\n\n <LANG> flags used when CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is Debug.\n• : Flags for MinSizeRel build type or configuration.\n\n <LANG> flags used when CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is MinSizeRel.Short for minimum size release.\n• : Flags for Release build type or configuration.\n\n <LANG> flags used when CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is Release\n• : Flags for RelWithDebInfo type or configuration.\n\n <LANG> flags used when CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is RelWithDebInfo. Short for Release With Debug Information.\n• : File extensions that should be ignored by the build.\n\n This is a list of file extensions that may be part of a project for a given language but are not compiled.\n• : Directories implicitly searched by the compiler for header files.\n\n CMake does not explicitly specify these directories on compiler command lines for language <LANG>. This prevents system include directories from being treated as user include directories on some compilers.\n• : Implicit linker search path detected for language <LANG>.\n\n Compilers typically pass directories containing language runtime libraries and default library search paths when they invoke a linker. These paths are implicit linker search directories for the compiler's language. CMake automatically detects these directories for each language and reports the results in this variable.\n• : Implicit link libraries and flags detected for language <LANG>.\n\n Compilers typically pass language runtime library names and other flags when they invoke a linker. These flags are implicit link options for the compiler's language. CMake automatically detects these libraries and flags for each language and reports the results in this variable.\n• : Preference value for linker language selection.\n\n The \"linker language\" for executable, shared library, and module targets is the language whose compiler will invoke the linker. The LINKER_LANGUAGE target property sets the language explicitly. Otherwise, the linker language is that whose linker preference value is highest among languages compiled and linked into the target. See also the CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE_PROPAGATES variable.\n• : True if CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE propagates across targets.\n\n This is used when CMake selects a linker language for a target. Languages compiled directly into the target are always considered. A language compiled into static libraries linked by the target is considered if this variable is true.\n• : Rule variable to link and executable.\n\n Rule variable to link and executable for the given language.\n• : Extension for the output of a compile for a single file.\n\n This is the extension for an object file for the given <LANG>. For example .obj for C on Windows.\n• : An internal variable subject to change.\n\n This is used in determining the platform and is subject to change.\n• : Size of pointer-to-data types for language <LANG>.\n\n This holds the size (in bytes) of pointer-to-data types in the target platform ABI. It is defined for languages C and CXX (C++).\n• : Extensions of source files for the given language.\n\n This is the list of extensions for a given languages source files.\n• : True if the compiler is GNU.\n\n If the selected <LANG> compiler is the GNU compiler then this is TRUE, if not it is FALSE.\n• : An internal variable subject to change.\n\n This is used in determining the compiler ABI and is subject to change.\n• : Specify a file that can change the build rule variables.\n\n If this variable is set, it should to point to a CMakeLists.txt file that will be read in by CMake after all the system settings have been set, but before they have been used. This would allow you to override any variables that need to be changed for some language.\n• : Default filename postfix for libraries under configuration <CONFIG>.\n\n When a non-executable target is created its <CONFIG>_POSTFIX target property is initialized with the value of this variable if it is set.\n• : Where to put all the ARCHIVE targets when built.\n\n This variable is used to initialize the ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY property on all the targets. See that target property for additional information.\n• : Use the install path for the RPATH\n\n Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when building executables etc on systems that use RPATH. When the software is installed the executables etc are relinked by CMake to have the install RPATH. If this variable is set to true then the software is always built with the install path for the RPATH and does not need to be relinked when installed.\n• : See variable CMAKE_<CONFIG>_POSTFIX.\n\n This variable is a special case of the more-general CMAKE_<CONFIG>_POSTFIX variable for the DEBUG configuration.\n• : Linker flags used to create executables.\n\n Flags used by the linker when creating an executable.\n• : Flag used when linking an executable.\n\n Same as CMAKE_C_FLAGS_* but used by the linker when creating executables.\n• : Fortran module output directory.\n\n This variable is used to initialize the Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY property on all the targets. See that target property for additional information.\n• : Automatically add the current source- and build directories to the include path.\n\n If this variable is enabled, CMake automatically adds in each directory ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} and ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR} to the include path for this directory. These additional include directories do not propagate down to subdirectories. This is useful mainly for out-of-source builds, where files generated into the build tree are included by files located in the source tree.\n\n By default CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR is OFF.\n• : Mac OSX directory name for installed targets.\n\n CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR is used to initialize the INSTALL_NAME_DIR property on all targets. See that target property for more information.\n• : The rpath to use for installed targets.\n\n A semicolon-separated list specifying the rpath to use in installed targets (for platforms that support it). This is used to initialize the target property INSTALL_RPATH for all targets.\n• : Add paths to linker search and installed rpath.\n\n CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH is a boolean that if set to true will append directories in the linker search path and outside the project to the INSTALL_RPATH. This is used to initialize the target property INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH for all targets.\n• : Where to put all the LIBRARY targets when built.\n\n This variable is used to initialize the LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY property on all the targets. See that target property for additional information.\n• : The flag used to add a library search path to a compiler.\n\n The flag used to specify a library directory to the compiler. On most compilers this is \"-L\".\n• : Linker flag used to specify a .def file for dll creation.\n\n The flag used to add a .def file when creating a dll on Windows, this is only defined on Windows.\n• : Flag used to link a library specified by a path to its file.\n\n The flag used before a library file path is given to the linker. This is needed only on very few platforms.\n• : Flag used to link a library into an executable.\n\n The flag used to specify a library to link to an executable. On most compilers this is \"-l\".\n• : Do not use the builtin ELF editor to fix RPATHs on installation.\n\n When an ELF binary needs to have a different RPATH after installation than it does in the build tree, CMake uses a builtin editor to change the RPATH in the installed copy. If this variable is set to true then CMake will relink the binary before installation instead of using its builtin editor.\n• : Where to put all the RUNTIME targets when built.\n\n This variable is used to initialize the RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY property on all the targets. See that target property for additional information.\n• : Do not include RPATHs in the build tree.\n\n Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when building executables etc on systems that use RPATH. When the software is installed the executables etc are relinked by CMake to have the install RPATH. If this variable is set to true then the software is always built with no RPATH.\n• : Use relative paths (May not work!).\n\n If this is set to TRUE, then the CMake will use relative paths between the source and binary tree. This option does not work for more complicated projects, and relative paths are used when possible. In general, it is not possible to move CMake generated makefiles to a different location regardless of the value of this variable.\n• : Old executable location variable.\n\n The target property RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY supercedes this variable for a target if it is set. Executable targets are otherwise placed in this directory.\n• : Old library location variable.\n\n The target properties ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, and RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY supercede this variable for a target if they are set. Library targets are otherwise placed in this directory.\n\nvariables defined by cmake, that give information about the project, and cmake\n• : Name of archiving tool for static libraries.\n\n This specifies name of the program that creates archive or static libraries.\n• : The path to the top level of the build tree.\n\n This is the full path to the top level of the current CMake build tree. For an in-source build, this would be the same as CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR.\n• : Tool used for the actual build process.\n\n This variable is set to the program that will be needed to build the output of CMake. If the generator selected was Visual Studio 6, the CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM will be set to msdev, for Unix makefiles it will be set to make or gmake, and for Visual Studio 7 it set to devenv. For Nmake Makefiles the value is nmake. This can be useful for adding special flags and commands based on the final build environment.\n• : The directory with the CMakeCache.txt file.\n\n This is the full path to the directory that has the CMakeCache.txt file in it. This is the same as CMAKE_BINARY_DIR.\n• : Major version of CMake used to create the CMakeCache.txt file\n\n This is stores the major version of CMake used to write a CMake cache file. It is only different when a different version of CMake is run on a previously created cache file.\n• : Minor version of CMake used to create the CMakeCache.txt file\n\n This is stores the minor version of CMake used to write a CMake cache file. It is only different when a different version of CMake is run on a previously created cache file.\n• : Patch version of CMake used to create the CMakeCache.txt file\n\n This is stores the patch version of CMake used to write a CMake cache file. It is only different when a different version of CMake is run on a previously created cache file.\n• : Build-time reference to per-configuration output subdirectory.\n\n For native build systems supporting multiple configurations in the build tree (such as Visual Studio and Xcode), the value is a reference to a build-time variable specifying the name of the per-configuration output subdirectory. On Makefile generators this evaluates to \".\" because there is only one configuration in a build tree. Example values:\n\n Since these values are evaluated by the native build system, this variable is suitable only for use in command lines that will be evaluated at build time. Example of intended usage:\n\n Note that CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR is no longer necessary for this purpose but has been left for compatibility with existing projects. Instead add_custom_command() recognizes executable target names in its COMMAND option, so \"${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool\" can be replaced by just \"mytool\".\n\n This variable is read-only. Setting it is undefined behavior. In multi-configuration build systems the value of this variable is passed as the value of preprocessor symbol \"CMAKE_INTDIR\" to the compilation of all source files.\n• : The full path to the cmake executable.\n\n This is the full path to the CMake executable cmake which is useful from custom commands that want to use the cmake -E option for portable system commands. (e.g. /usr/local/bin/cmake\n• : Is CMake currently cross compiling.\n\n This variable will be set to true by CMake if CMake is cross compiling. Specifically if the build platform is different from the target platform.\n• : Full path to ctest command installed with cmake.\n\n This is the full path to the CTest executable ctest which is useful from custom commands that want to use the cmake -E option for portable system commands.\n• : The path to the binary directory currently being processed.\n\n This the full path to the build directory that is currently being processed by cmake. Each directory added by add_subdirectory will create a binary directory in the build tree, and as it is being processed this variable will be set. For in-source builds this is the current source directory being processed.\n• : Full path to the listfile currently being processed.\n\n As CMake processes the listfiles in your project this variable will always be set to the one currently being processed. The value has dynamic scope. When CMake starts processing commands in a source file it sets this variable to the location of the file. When CMake finishes processing commands from the file it restores the previous value. Therefore the value of the variable inside a macro or function is the file invoking the bottom-most entry on the call stack, not the file containing the macro or function definition.\n• : The line number of the current file being processed.\n\n This is the line number of the file currently being processed by cmake.\n• : The path to the source directory currently being processed.\n\n This the full path to the source directory that is currently being processed by cmake.\n• : Name of library containing dlopen and dlcose.\n\n The name of the library that has dlopen and dlclose in it, usually -ldl on most UNIX machines.\n• : Full path to cmake-gui or ccmake.\n\n This is the full path to the CMake executable that can graphically edit the cache. For example, cmake-gui, ccmake, or cmake -i.\n• : The suffix for executables on this platform.\n\n The suffix to use for the end of an executable if any, .exe on Windows.\n• : The extra generator used to build the project.\n\n When using the Eclipse, CodeBlocks or KDevelop generators, CMake generates Makefiles (CMAKE_GENERATOR) and additionally project files for the respective IDE. This IDE project file generator is stored in CMAKE_EXTRA_GENERATOR (e.g. \"Eclipse CDT4\").\n• : Additional suffixes for shared libraries.\n\n Extensions for shared libraries other than that specified by CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX, if any. CMake uses this to recognize external shared library files during analysis of libraries linked by a target.\n• : The generator used to build the project.\n\n The name of the generator that is being used to generate the build files. (e.g. \"Unix Makefiles\", \"Visual Studio 6\", etc.)\n• : Path to top of source tree.\n\n This is the path to the top level of the source tree.\n• : The prefix for import libraries that you link to.\n\n The prefix to use for the name of an import library if used on this platform.\n• : The suffix for import libraries that you link to.\n\n The suffix to use for the end of an import library if used on this platform.\n• : The suffix for libraries that you link to.\n\n The suffix to use for the end of a library, .lib on Windows.\n• : The Major version of cmake (i.e. the 2 in 2.X.X)\n\n This specifies the major version of the CMake executable being run.\n• : See CMAKE_BUILD_TOOL.\n\n This variable is around for backwards compatibility, see CMAKE_BUILD_TOOL.\n• : The Minor version of cmake (i.e. the 4 in X.4.X).\n\n This specifies the minor version of the CMake executable being run.\n• : Full path to the parent listfile of the one currently being processed.\n\n As CMake processes the listfiles in your project this variable will always be set to the listfile that included or somehow invoked the one currently being processed. See also CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE.\n• : The patch version of cmake (i.e. the 3 in X.X.3).\n\n This specifies the patch version of the CMake executable being run.\n• : The name of the current project.\n\n This specifies name of the current project from the closest inherited PROJECT command.\n• : Name of randomizing tool for static libraries.\n\n This specifies name of the program that randomizes libraries on UNIX, not used on Windows, but may be present.\n• : Install directory for running cmake.\n\n This is the install root for the running CMake and the Modules directory can be found here. This is commonly used in this format: ${CMAKE_ROOT}/Modules\n• : The prefix for shared libraries that you link to.\n\n The prefix to use for the name of a shared library, lib on UNIX.\n• : The suffix for shared libraries that you link to.\n\n The suffix to use for the end of a shared library, .dll on Windows.\n• : The prefix for loadable modules that you link to.\n\n The prefix to use for the name of a loadable module on this platform.\n• : The suffix for shared libraries that you link to.\n\n The suffix to use for the end of a loadable module on this platform\n• : Size of a void pointer.\n\n This is set to the size of a pointer on the machine, and is determined by a try compile. If a 64 bit size is found, then the library search path is modified to look for 64 bit libraries first.\n• : If true, do not add run time path information.\n\n If this is set to TRUE, then the rpath information is not added to compiled executables. The default is to add rpath information if the platform supports it.This allows for easy running from the build tree.\n• : The path to the top level of the source tree.\n\n This is the full path to the top level of the current CMake source tree. For an in-source build, this would be the same as CMAKE_BINARY_DIR.\n• : Libraries linked into every executable and shared library.\n\n This is the list of libraries that are linked into all executables and libraries.\n• : The prefix for static libraries that you link to.\n\n The prefix to use for the name of a static library, lib on UNIX.\n• : The suffix for static libraries that you link to.\n\n The suffix to use for the end of a static library, .lib on Windows.\n• : True if free visual studio tools being used.\n\n This is set to true if the compiler is Visual Studio free tools.\n• : Create verbose makefiles if on.\n\n This variable defaults to false. You can set this variable to true to make CMake produce verbose makefiles that show each command line as it is used.\n• : The full version of cmake in major.minor.patch format.\n\n This specifies the full version of the CMake executable being run. This variable is defined by versions 2.6.3 and higher. See variables CMAKE_MAJOR_VERSION, CMAKE_MINOR_VERSION, and CMAKE_PATCH_VERSION for individual version components.\n• : Full path to build directory for project.\n\n This is the binary directory of the most recent PROJECT command.\n• : Name of the project given to the project command.\n\n This is the name given to the most recent PROJECT command.\n• : Top level source directory for the current project.\n\n This is the source directory of the most recent PROJECT command.\n• : Top level binary directory for the named project.\n\n A variable is created with the name used in the PROJECT command, and is the binary directory for the project. This can be useful when SUBDIR is used to connect several projects.\n• : Top level source directory for the named project.\n\n A variable is created with the name used in the PROJECT command, and is the source directory for the project. This can be useful when add_subdirectory is used to connect several projects.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\nRedistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\nRedistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\nNeither the names of Kitware, Inc., the Insight Software Consortium, nor the names of their contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

        "document": "As C++ programmers, we always struggle with building projects written in C++. Sometimes we clone a C++ project and spend a long time understanding how the project is built. And sometimes we need to build our own projects by ourselves. For C++, there are many choices related to build systems like Makefile, CMake, Ninja, Bazel, and Scons, to name a few. It’s not easy to find a perfect combination for our C++ project. This article will introduce you to the most stable, the most powerful, and the fastest build system for C++.\n\nCMake is probably the most widely used and the most powerful build system generator for C++. Many large projects written in C++ are using CMake as their build system generator, so you may often use CMake and encounter files like . And sometimes you need to open these CMake files to figure out how a project is organized and built. Or you may write your own CMake files to build your own project.\n\nSomehow you manage to read and write CMake files for a project, then what? You would need a build system. Every build system has pros and cons, but build speed might be the most important factor when choosing a build system for your project. If you are working on a very large project, it would take a long time to build and test the project after you change a tiny piece of code. Ninja just might be the answer for you if speed matters. For instance, the LLVM framework, which has millions of Lines of Code (LoC), recommends its developers use the combination of CMake and Ninja.\n\nIf you are a C++ developer who wants to understand the CMake build system more, this is the right article for you. This article will teach you the best practice of reading and writing CMake files, so you can better understand and build projects. We also assume that you know nothing about CMake or Ninja. So don’t panic and buckle up!"

        "document": "This article discusses the Ninja build tool. Earthly ensures consistent builds across team environments with its reproducibility features. Check it out.\n\nNinja is a compact build system with a focus on fast incremental builds. It was originally developed by Evan Martin, a Google dev, partly in response to the needs of building large projects such as Google Chrome.\n\nIf you’re developing a software system and you require a rebuild every few minutes to test your latest feature or code block, then Ninja will only rebuild what you have just modified or added and nothing else—as opposed to Make, which would rebuild the whole project every single time.\n\nThis article will start by explaining build systems in a little more detail. It’ll then introduce Ninja and teach you how to use Ninja to build a simple C++ project.\n\nSoftware projects are usually composed of many files. And the process of compiling, linking, copying, structuring, testing, or more generally, processing these files into an executable program is called a build.\n• Build generator: Software that takes as input a spec file written in a specially designed language (in many cases, Turing Complete programming languages) and generates a build file that tells build tools how to go about building a software package.\n• Build tool: Software that takes in a build file previously generated by a build generator and then builds a software package. Ninja is an example of a build tool.\n\nNext, let’s take a closer look at Ninja and when you may want to use it.\n\nNinja is a fast build tool that can also be used as a build tool for other build generators. As mentioned, it was originally developed by Evan Martin, a Google dev, as a resource to speed up the building of projects such as Chrome. Since its inception, some notable projects built using Ninja include Chrome, Android, all Meson projects, Swift, and LLVM.\n\nNinja differs from other build systems in two major ways:\n• It’s designed to have its input files generated by a higher-level build system such as CMake or Meson, and\n• It’s designed to run builds as fast as possible.\n\nThis philosophy even goes into the default arguments, which are designed to provide the best performance with little to no tinkering. For example, it builds things in parallel by default. This motivates developers to ensure that their code can be built in parallel, and any problems can be detected early in the development process.\n\nNext, we’ll take a closer look at the strengths and weaknesses of Ninja as a build system.\n\nThe main advantage of Ninja is its speed in incremental builds. It incentivizes developers to write code that can be built in parallel, using defaults that utilize the flag, which causes Ninja to build in parallel. Furthermore, Ninja doesn’t use a background daemon to constantly keep track of things in memory; it always starts its own binary from scratch and works without relying on any state. So developers will always have a realistic idea of build time without fancy background optimizations done by daemons, and it also makes Ninja very portable and simple.\n\nAccording to benchmarks, Ninja performs as well as Make in a fresh build but outperforms it in an incremental build by what appears to be an exponentially increasing factor.\n\nOn the downside, Ninja can’t build projects without a build file, so it must always work with a build generator, such as CMake or Meson, the most popular build generators that work with Ninja. Problems can be introduced depending on the build generator used. For example, Make requires each file to be specified in the build file, making the process of writing these files extremely complicated, time consuming, and prone to errors. So, the key is to choose the right build generator that works well with Ninja.\n\nWhen Should You Use Ninja?\n\nNinja works well for large projects with many files that need many incremental builds over a short time. If you’re already using Make, Meson, or CMake to generate build files and using Make to build them, Ninja is a plug-and-play replacement that will, at worst, keep the performance the same or, at best, improve it in an exponential manner in case of incremental builds.\n\nConversely, Ninja might not be a good choice if you want an end-to-end tool (build generator and tool in one) that has a high-level language to describe relationships between files and is also a build tool. In that case, something like Bazel might be better, but it’s often slower than Ninja and not as portable.\n\nThe following sections explain the different ways to install Ninja before going through step-by-step instructions for implementing a Ninja build.\n\nThis section explains how to install Ninja on Linux, Mac, and Windows, and how to build it from source.\n\nFor a more thorough set of instructions for any specialized installation cases, please see the Ninja GitHub page, a very useful resource. For day-to-day use, the wiki page also includes a list of standard build patterns and build generators that work well with Ninja.\n\nDepending on the Linux flavor, the installation process differs a bit:\n\nNinja can be installed using either Homebrew or MacPorts with the following one-liners:\n\nChocolatey or Scoop can be used to install Ninja with a one-liner on Windows:\n\nNinja can also be installed via package managers, which generally provide more convenience when managing multiple other packages in addition to it:\n\nUsers who don’t want to build Ninja with specialized flags can build it from source with the following instructions.\n\nFirst, and the Ninja repo:\n\nThen, build a basic Ninja binary and a set of files needed to build Ninja:\n\nThis will generate the Ninja binary and a file that can be used to build Ninja with itself. That is, the basic Ninja binary generated in the previous step can be used to build the particular configuration of Ninja required. A sort of “ninjaception” if you will.\n\nUse the following code to build Ninja:\n\nThe Ninja binary will now be inside the directory (though the user can name this directory anything).\n\nThe following code will run the unit tests:\n\nTo demonstrate how to use Ninja as well as showcase some of its strengths, this tutorial uses a sample project, which can be found in this GitHub repo.\n\nThis tutorial will show you how to create a simple from-scratch project and an incremental project to demonstrate the time-saving features of Ninja.\n\nThe following are prerequisites to follow along:\n• CMake is required to build the project. Instructions for CMake installation can be found on their official website.\n• For Linux users, CMake can be installed with the single terminal command . It can be installed on macOS with .\n• Python is required to generate the sample files used in this tutorial. Ensure Python is installed.\n\nTo create a project from scratch, do the following:\n• Navigate to the project directory using\n• Navigate to the from-scratch project using\n• Notice the two files inside this folder: and\n\nis a simple C++ program that prints “Hello World” to the console:\n\nis a CMake file that describes the project and how to build it:\n\nNow use CMake to generate a build file for Ninja:\n\nThis should generate a file in the current directory, along with related configuration files.\n\nThe project can now be built with Ninja using the following command:\n\nThe following output should be generated:\n\nWith that, the Ninja project should be successfully built.\n\nNow, go back to the root of the repository and navigate to the incremental project by running:\n\nThere are three files here: , , and .\n\nThe file is a Python script that generates the C++ project files and the CMake file from the template files.\n\nThis script needs to be run twice: once to generate a 1000-file project and a second time to generate a 1001-file project. So the second project will be an incremental build of the first.\n\nNow, use CMake to generate a build file for Ninja:\n\nThis should generate a file in the current directory, along with related configuration files.\n\nNext, emulate an incremental build by adding one more file to your sample project:\n\nUse CMake to generate a build file for Ninja:\n\nThis should generate a file in the current directory, along with related configuration files.\n\nAs before, build the project with Ninja:\n\nIn the second build, Ninja only builds the new file and not the entire project. This can be seen in the terminal output that shows how many files had to be processed, as well as the time taken for the build to complete.\n\nOn the local setup (Apple M1 Max, 16-inch) used in this tutorial, the first build took 35 seconds, and the second build took three seconds.\n\nThe following is a copy of the terminal output for the second build:\n\nAs you can see, Ninja is able to build the updated 1001-file project in only three seconds, compared to the 35 seconds it took to build its predecessor project consisting of 1000 files. Because Ninja had already built the 1000-file variant of the same project, it only had to add one more file to the build.\n\nSo, we’ve dived deep into build systems and Ninja, covering how to install and use Ninja for your C++ projects. Remember, tools like build systems are your best pals for automating software building, testing, and deployment. Ninja is just one awesome tool that can save you heaps of time.\n\nAnd if you loved Ninja, you might want to take a peek at Earthly for more build automation improvements."
