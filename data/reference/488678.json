For your data to be usable, you must consider how they are presented to end users and how quickly they can answer queries. In this post, we will discuss how to construct data models that are easier to maintain, more helpful, and have better performance. In the realm of data and analytics, data modeling has gained increasing prominence.\n\nData analysts without a background in data engineering may now participate in building, defining, and constructing data models for use in business intelligence and analytics tasks, thanks to modern technologies and tools. The word \"data modeling\" can be interpreted in a variety of ways. Data modeling will be defined as the process of developing data tables for usage by users, BI tools, and applications.\n\nWith the advent of the contemporary data warehouse and ELT pipeline, many of the traditional norms and holy cows of data modeling are no longer applicable and, in some cases, even harmful.\n\nIn this blog, we will examine the current best practices for data modeling from the perspective of data analysts, software engineers, and analytics engineers who construct these models.\n\nApproximately 70% of software development initiatives fail due to early coding. Data modeling assists in characterizing the structure, connections, and limitations pertinent to accessing data, and encodes these rules into a standard that is re-usable. Preparing a comprehensive data model requires familiarity with the process and its advantages, the many types of data models, best practices, and related software tools.\n\nA data model is a tool for describing the fundamental business rules and data definitions associated with data. Data Modeling provides business and technical stakeholders with a clear, visual representation of complicated data ideas, to their benefit.\n\nWhy are Data Modeling Best Practices Important\n\nThe activities of every contemporary, data-driven organization create a large quantity of data. Due to differences in business activities, systems, and procedures, the data must be appropriately consolidated, cleaned to eliminate noise, and converted to allow meaningful analytics. To achieve this goal, it is required to execute a Data Modeling exercise to arrange the data consistently and save it in a way that can be utilized for several reasons.\n\nIn addition, an efficient data model offers a stable basis for any Data Warehouse, allowing it to accommodate expanding data quantities and readily accommodate the addition or deletion of data entities.\n\nWatch below video to see how Saras Analytics helps Omnichannel brands turn fragmented data into powerful insights!\n\n\n\nTop ecommerce brands trust Saras Analytics for their data strategy. Now, it's your turn—Try for free\n\nThe conceptual data model is the initial stage in comprehending the organization's operations. It aids in the documentation of how the firm functions, essential business principles, and how it all works to support business operations. It is a communication technique that Data Architects use to convey information to corporate audiences, particularly executives and important stakeholders.\n\nAfter completing the conceptual data model, the next level of detail is the logical data model. The logical data model explains data structures, their connections, and the properties of each item in more detail.\n\nTo construct databases, the database development team requires physical data models. This level contains keys, constraints, main and foreign key associations, and specific data types for every attribute.\n\nThese 10 approaches will assist you in enhancing your data modeling and its usefulness to your organization.\n\nThe purpose of data modeling is to improve an organization's operation. As a data modeler responsible for gathering, organizing, and storing data for analysis, you can only achieve this objective if you understand the enterprise's requirements. Often, the greatest data modeling problem is accurately capturing business needs to determine which data to prioritize, gather, store, process, and make available to users. Therefore, we cannot stress this enough: obtain a thorough grasp of the requirements by inquiring about the desired outcomes from the data. Then organize your data with these objectives in mind.\n\nObserving many rows and columns of alphabetic entries is unlikely to result in insight. Most people are far more at ease with graphical representations of data that make it easy to spot abnormalities or with drag-and-drop interfaces that allow them to swiftly analyze and merge data tables. These techniques to data visualization assist you clean your data so that it is comprehensive, consistent, and free of mistake and redundancy. In addition, they assist you identify distinct data record types that correspond to the same real-world object (such as \"Customer ID\" and \"Client Ref. \"), allowing you to modify them to utilize common fields and formats, so making it simpler to merge several data sources.\n\nCommence with Simple Data Modeling and Expand Thereafter\n\nDue to considerations including quantity, nature, structure, growth pace, and query language, data can quickly become complicated. Keeping data models modest and straightforward at the outset facilitates the correction of errors. When you are certain that your early models are reliable and informative, you may incorporate more datasets, reducing discrepancies as you go. You should search for a tool that makes it simple to get started, but can accommodate extremely massive data models later, and that allows you to easily \"mash-up\" many data sources from various places.\n\nUnderstanding how these four parts constitute business questions can help you organize data in a manner that makes it simpler to deliver responses. For instance, say your business is a retail chain with several locations, and you need to determine which stores sold the most of a certain product over the last year. In this instance, the facts would be the overall historical sales data (all sales of all products from all stores for each day over the past \"N\" years), the dimensions considered would be \"product\" and \"store location\", the filter would be \"previous 12 months\", and the order could be \"top five stores in descending order of sales of the given product.\" By structuring your data using separate tables for facts and dimensions, you simplify the analysis to identify the top sales performers for each sales period and to address other business intelligence queries.\n\nUse Only the Necessary Data Rather Than All Available Data\n\nComputers dealing with massive datasets can quickly encounter memory and input-output performance issues. In many instances, only a tiny subset of the data is required to address business queries. Ideally, you should be able to identify which sections of datasets are to be used by simply checking boxes on-screen, allowing you to minimize data modeling waste and performance difficulties.\n\nA primary objective of data modeling is to construct a single version of the truth against which users may pose business inquiries. People may have differing ideas on how an answer should be applied, but there should be no controversy regarding the facts or math utilized to arrive at the result. For instance, a computation may be necessary to aggregate daily sales data into monthly statistics, which may then be compared to reveal the best and worst months. You may prevent difficulties by putting up this computation in advance as part of your data modeling and having it available in the dashboard for end users, as opposed to requiring everyone to use a calculator or spreadsheet tool (both of which are major causes of user mistake).\n\nBefore Continuing, Verify Each Stage of your Data Modeling\n\nBefore proceeding to the next stage, each activity should be reviewed, beginning with the data modeling priorities derived from the business requirements. For instance, a dataset must have an attribute called the primary key so that each record may be uniquely recognized by the value of the main key in that record. Suppose you choose \"ProductID\" as the primary key for the aforementioned historical sales dataset. This may be validated by comparing the total number of rows for \"ProductID\" in the dataset to the total number of unique (no duplicates) rows. If the two counts are same, \"ProductID\" may be used to uniquely identify each record; otherwise, another primary key must be identified. The same method may be applied to a joining of two datasets to ensure that their relationship is either one-to-one or one-to-many and to avoid many-to-many interactions that result in unnecessarily complicated or unmanageable data models.\n\nData modeling contains use recommendations for the modeled data. While allowing end users to access business analytics on their own is a significant step forward, it is vital that they refrain from leaping to incorrect assumptions. For instance, they may observe that the sales of two distinct items appear to grow and decline in tandem. Are the sales of one product causing the sales of another (a cause-and-effect relationship) or do they just rise and fall together (a simple correlation) due to an external factor such as the economy or the weather? Confusion between cause and correlation might lead to the targeting of incorrect or nonexistent opportunities, so squandering corporate resources.\n\nUtilize Intelligent Tools to Do the Heavy Lifting\n\nComplex data modeling may need coding or other procedures to handle data prior to analysis. However, if such \"heavy lifting\" can be performed by a software application, you are freed from the requirement to master many programming languages and may devote your time to other enterprise-beneficial activities. All steps of data ETL can be facilitated or automated by a proper software application (extracting, transforming, and loading). Data can be accessible graphically without the need for scripting, various data sources can be combined using a simple drag-and-drop interface, and data modeling can even be performed automatically based on the query type.\n\nBusiness data models are never set in stone since data sources and business goals are ever-changing. You must therefore anticipate upgrading or altering them over time. Use a data dictionary or \"ready reference\" with clear, up-to-date information on the purpose and structure of each piece of data to put your data models in a repository that facilitates their growth and change.\n\nThe field of data modeling is developing, and with the growth of cloud storage and computation, it will only continue to grow and improve. Due to the promising outcomes the two gives when combined, data modeling for data warehouse will soon be an enterprise-wide priority. The two procedures will continue to offer value to organizations and improve their long-term planning.\n\nThese strategies give clear lines of cross-functional communication and comprehension in a technical world that is always growing and where these ties will only become more useful.\n\nAs organizational infrastructures migrate to the cloud, data modeling software assists stakeholders in making educated decisions regarding what, when, and how data should be migrated.\n\nUnderstanding how to implement technologies such as power BI models, ELT, data storage, data migration, and data streaming, among others, begins with a commitment to modeling the underlying data and the factors that contribute to its existence.\n\nData modeling is, at its heart, a paradigm of data comprehension prior to analysis or action. With current data modeling strategies, such as codeless models, visual model construction, representative data shaping, graph techniques, programming, and more, its significance and need will increase exponentially as diverse domains increase their adoption rates.\n\nThere are four principles and best practices for data modeling design to help you enhance the productivity of your data warehouse:\n\nIndicate the level of granularity at which the data will be kept. Usually, the least proposed grain would be the starting point for data modeling. Then, you may modify and combine the data to obtain summary insights.\n\nNaming things remains a problem in data modeling. The ideal practice is to pick and adhere to a naming scheme.\n\nUtilize schemas to identify name-space relations, such as data sources or business units. For instance, you might use the marketing schema to hold the tables most relevant to the marketing team, and the analytics schema to store advanced concepts such as long-term value.\n\nIt is one of the most important tools for constructing an exceptional data model. If you build the relation as a table, you may precompute any required computations, resulting in faster query response times for your user base.\n\nIf you expose your relation as a view, your users' queries will return the most recent data sets. Nonetheless, reaction times will be sluggish. Depending on the data warehousing strategy and technologies you employ, you may have to make various trade-offs according to actualization.\n\nData modelers should be aware of the varying rights and data governance requirements of the enterprise. Working collaboratively with your security team to verify that your data warehouse adheres to all applicable regulations would be beneficial.\n\nFor instance, firms that deal with medical data sets are subject to HIPAA data authorization and privacy rules. All customer-facing internet firms should be aware of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR), and SaaS enterprises are frequently constrained in their ability to exploit client data depending on the terms of their contracts.\n\nThese are the most significant high-level considerations while developing data models. The most essential piece of advice I can provide is to continually examine how to produce a better product for consumers; analyze the requirements and experiences of users and strive to create a data model that best serves these concerns. While having a big toolbox of data modeling approaches and styles is advantageous, rigid adherence to any one set of principles or methodology is typically inferior to a flexible approach based on your organization's specific requirements."

        "document": "Data models play an integral role in the development of effective data architecture for modern businesses. They are key to the conceptualization, planning, and building of an integrated data repository that drives advanced analytics and BI. In this blog post, we’ll provide you with an overview of the most popular data modeling techniques and best practices to ensure an agile and efficient data warehouse development process.\n\nThe proven approach to seamlessly designing and deploying a data warehouse is putting enterprise data modeling at the center of your data warehousing process. By doing so, you can ensure a seamless path from design to development and deployment.\n\nThough data modelers have multiple approaches to creating these schemas, it’s critical to pick the right one for your business use case.\n\nData modeling is the process of designing a framework that defines the data relationships within a database or a data warehouse. It involves creating a visual schema to describe associations and constraints between datasets. It gives a conceptual representation of data and visualizes the interrelation between datasets within a system. There are three main perspectives of data models:\n• Conceptual Model: It is a visual representation of database concepts and focuses on determining the entities within a system, their characteristics, and relationships between them.\n• Logical Model: It defines the structure of the entities and provides further context on their relationships, providing a technical map of data structures and rules.\n• Physical Model: It is a framework or schema specifying how the model will be built in a database. It represents the tables, columns, data types, etc.\n\nThe following are a few data modeling techniques to know:\n\nA network technique involves designing a flexible database model representing objects and their relationships. It has a schema that provides the logical view of the database in a graphical form. The network model is similar to a hierarchical model, but unlike the latter, it supports multiple parent and child records, making it easier to handle complex relationships.\n\nEntity-relationship modeling is a technique used to define data elements, entities, and their relationships in a database. This technique involves creating an entity-relationship diagram comprising entities, attributes, and relationships in a graphical format. It serves as a conceptual blueprint to be implemented as a database.\n\nRelational technique is used to describe the relationships between the data elements stored in rows and columns. These relations between the entities can be one to one, one to many, many to one, and many to many. Data modelers use this technique to minimize the complexity and ensure a clear overview of the data.\n• Look at the business process from the most holistic sense possible so you can identify all the component systems and entities relevant to your use case.\n• When using 3rd Normal Form, create narrow tables for your datasets. Wide tables result in longer scans/reads, which can affect performance of your data model – especially when dealing with large volumes of data or multiple tables.\n• Always build a data model around a business process. This approach will make it easier for analysts to navigate the data model and quickly get the answers to their questions.\n• Evaluate data on a granular level. The more you know about each dataset, the more appropriately you can place it into the data models.\n\nData modeling is about understanding your business and data before moving forward with analytics. Equipping yourself with the knowledge of modern data modeling techniques and best practices will help you build a data model that will serve your business and end-user requirements.\n\nMoreover, using automated tools to optimize the data modeling process is a great way to fast-track data management projects. Modern solutions eliminate the need to manually code, configure, and test your schema, significantly cutting down the time to design a data model.\n\nAs a result, you can quickly set up a functional data warehouse and start your analytics journey."

        "document": "Relational databases are the workhorses of data storage; they excel at organizing large amounts of information into a structured format, making it easy to store, retrieve, and manage. Whether you’re managing a company’s customer records, tracking inventory in a store, or building a personal library of movies, a relational database can be your secret weapon.\n\nThis comprehensive guide is designed to equip you with the knowledge and tools to build a relational database. We’ll outline the technical aspects of creating tables, defining relationships, and querying data and also explore the theoretical foundations of relational database design.\n\nSo, whether you’re a seasoned developer or just starting your journey into the world of data, this guide is here to empower you. Let’s dive in and build a solid foundation for your data management needs.\n• A relational database is a structured collection of data organized into tables (or relations) that are connected by defined relationships. This allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and management of data using SQL (Structured Language Query).\n• A relational database management system (RDBMS) is software that enables users to create, manage, and interact with relational databases by organizing data into tables with relationships. It ensures data integrity, supports SQL for querying, and enables efficient data storage and retrieval.\n• Relational databases are used for storing, organizing, and managing large amounts of structured data, such as customer information, transaction records, and inventory management. They can be used in industries like finance, healthcare, and e-commerce.\n\nA relational database is a structured system for storing and organizing data in a way that allows for efficient retrieval and manipulation. It follows the relational model, which emphasizes data organization into tables and the establishment of relationships between those tables.\n\nHere’s why relational databases are crucial for data management:\n• Organization: They provide a clear and structured way to store large amounts of data, making it easy to find specific information quickly.\n• Data Integrity: The relational model enforces data consistency and reduces redundancy, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of your information.\n• Scalability: They can efficiently handle large datasets and accommodate growing data volumes.\n• Data Sharing: The structured format allows for easy sharing and manipulation of data across different applications and processes.\n\nThe concept of relational databases is rooted in the mathematical theory of relations. A relational database table can be seen as a mathematical relation where each row is a tuple, and the columns represent the attributes of that data.\n\nUnderstanding this connection helps us grasp the core principles of relational databases:\n• Tables: Correspond to mathematical relations, with rows and columns representing tuples and attributes.\n• Primary Keys: Uniquely identify each row in a table, similar to how mathematical relations avoid duplicate entries.\n• Relationships: Established between tables using foreign keys, which link data points across tables, reflecting the connections between sets in mathematical relations.\n\nBy leveraging these mathematical concepts, relational databases ensure data organization, minimize redundancy and enable powerful data manipulation techniques.\n\nBefore getting involved in table structures and queries, it’s crucial to establish clear goals for your relational database. Your ideal database should be efficient, adaptable, and perfectly suited to the unique needs of your organization.\n• Focus: Clearly defined goals help you focus on the data that truly matters for your organization’s needs.\n• Scalability: Goals that consider future growth ensure your database can adapt to accommodate evolving data needs.\n\nHow to Define Your Database Goals:\n• Identify Data Users: Who will be using this database, and for what purposes? Understanding their needs is key. (e.g., Marketing team, Sales department, Customer support)\n• Data Requirements: What specific data points are essential to capture and manage?\n• Desired Functionality: What kind of operations need to be performed on the data? (e.g., Reporting, Data Analysis, Searching)\n• Future Considerations: How might your data needs change over time? Will you need to integrate with other systems?\n\nThe true power of relational databases lies in their ability to establish connections between different tables.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the different types of data relationships:\n• One-to-One (1:1): In this relationship, a single record in one table corresponds to exactly one record in another table. This is less common but can be used in specific scenarios.\n• One-to-Many (1:N): This is the most fundamental and widely used relationship. A single record in one table (the “one” side) can be linked to multiple records in another table (the “many” side). This is often achieved through the use of a foreign key, which references the primary key of the “one” side table.\n• Many-to-Many (N:N): Here, multiple records in one table can be associated with multiple records in another table. Relational databases cannot directly represent this relationship, but we can create a workaround using an associative table. This associative table has foreign keys referencing both the original tables and establishes the many-to-many connection.\n\nUnderstanding these relationships is key to designing an efficient and organized database structure. By properly defining relationships, you can:\n• Minimize Data Redundancy: Store data only once and avoid duplication across tables.\n• Maintain Data Integrity: Ensure consistency and accuracy of information by linking related data points.\n• Simplify Data Retrieval: Perform complex queries that span multiple tables to retrieve the information you need.\n\nNow that you understand the core concepts of relational databases, let’s explore some best practices for designing them effectively. Following these principles will ensure your database is functional, efficient, manageable, and future-proof.\n• Normalization: This is a set of techniques to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity. Normalization involves breaking down tables into smaller, focused tables with well-defined relationships.\n• Clear and Consistent Naming: Use descriptive and consistent names for tables, columns, and constraints. This enhances the readability and maintainability of your database.\n• Data Types: Choose appropriate data types for each column, such as integers for numbers, dates for time-based data, and text for descriptive information. This ensures data accuracy and efficient storage.\n• Constraints: Utilize constraints like primary keys and foreign keys to enforce data integrity and prevent invalid entries.\n• Clear Documentation: Document your database design clearly, including table structures, relationships, and the purpose of each field. This is crucial for future maintenance and collaboration.\n• Data Duplication: Avoid storing the same data in multiple places. This can lead to inconsistencies and maintenance headaches.\n• Poor Data Naming: Cryptic or inconsistent naming conventions can make the database difficult to understand and navigate.\n• Inflexible Design: Don’t anticipate every future need, but design with some level of flexibility to accommodate potential growth and changes.\n• Security Oversights: Implement proper access controls and security measures to safeguard your sensitive data.\n• Lack of Testing: Thoroughly test your database design and queries before deploying them to real-world use cases.\n\nThe Role of SQL in Database Creation in Relational Databases\n\nSQL (Structured Query Language) is the cornerstone of interacting with relational databases. It’s a powerful and standardized language that allows you to create, manipulate, and retrieve data from your database.\n\nHere’s a glimpse into how SQL empowers you to manage your relational database:\n• Database Creation: SQL commands like CREATE TABLE enable you to define the structure of your tables, specifying columns, data types, and constraints.\n• Data Manipulation: SQL provides a rich set of commands for inserting, updating, and deleting data within your tables. (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)\n• Data Retrieval: The SELECT statement is the heart of data retrieval in SQL. You can use it to extract specific data points or entire rows based on various criteria and filter conditions.\n• Data Relationships: SQL allows you to establish relationships between tables using foreign keys. This is often achieved through the FOREIGN KEY constraint within the CREATE TABLE statement.\n\nNow that we’ve explored the fundamental concepts and design principles, let’s build a simple relational database using SQL.\n\nStep 1: Define Your Purpose and Data Needs\n\nHere, you’ll identify the purpose of your database and the specific data points you want to manage.\n• What kind of information will you be storing? (e.g., Customer information, Product inventory, Library of books)\n• Who will be using this database, and how? (e.g., Sales team, Marketing department, Personal reference)\n\nBy answering these questions, you can determine the tables you need and the attributes (columns) within those tables.\n\nCreating an Entity-Relationship Model (ERM) can be a helpful visualization tool, especially for complex data structures. An ERM is a diagram that represents the entities (tables) in your database and the relationships between them.\n\nOnce you have a clear understanding of your data, it’s time to translate that knowledge into SQL commands to create the tables in your database. Here’s a breakdown of the process:\n• Use the CREATE TABLE statement: This command defines the structure of your table, specifying its name and the columns it will contain.\n• Define Columns: For each column, specify its name, data type (e.g., text, integer, date), and any constraints like primary key or foreign key.\n\nThis code creates a table named “Customers” with four columns:\n• customer_id: An auto-incrementing integer that uniquely identifies each customer (primary key).\n• first_name: Customer’s first name (text, not null).\n• last_name: Customer’s last name (text, not null).\n\nNow that you have your tables defined, it’s time to establish relationships between them if necessary. Foreign keys are used to link data points across tables, enforcing referential integrity and preventing inconsistencies.\n\nHere, the Orders table is created with a foreign key customer_id that references the primary key of the Customers table. This ensures that each order has a valid customer associated with it.\n\nWith your tables in place, you can start inserting data using the INSERT statement in SQL.\n\nFinally, the power of your relational database lies in its ability to retrieve specific data. SQL’s SELECT statement allows you to query your database based on various criteria, filtering and sorting data to answer your questions and generate reports.\n\nIt’s crucial to identify your data requirements in great detail. This initial phase allows for a structured and efficient database that perfectly aligns with your application or business needs.\n\nHere, we’ll explore a step-by-step process to identify your data requirements:\n• What problem are you trying to solve, or what information do you need to manage? (e.g., Tracking customer orders for an e-commerce store, Managing employee information for a company)\n• Who will be using this data, and for what purposes? (e.g., Sales team, Marketing department, Human Resources)\n• Entities are the core building blocks of your data model. They represent the real-world objects or concepts you want to store information about. Think of them as the “things” in your data universe. (e.g., In an e-commerce store, entities could be Customers, Products, or Orders)\n• Once you have your entities identified, it’s time to determine the specific characteristics or details you want to capture for each one. These characteristics become the attributes (columns) of your database tables. Ask yourself: What information do you need to know about each entity?\n• In the real world, entities rarely exist in isolation. They often have connections with each other. Your data model needs to reflect these relationships to accurately represent the information structure. Analyze how your entities interact and identify the nature of those relationships. A Product can be included in many Orders, and an Order can contain multiple Products (Many-to-Many relationship – typically requiring an associative table).)\n• Involve Stakeholders: Get input from different departments or users who will be working with the data.\n• Start Simple, Iterate Often: Begin with a core set of entities and attributes. As your understanding evolves, refine and expand your data model.\n• Document Everything: Clearly document your data requirements, including entity definitions, attribute details, and relationship descriptions.\n\nKnack’s no-code platform offers a user-friendly interface for building database schemas without writing code. Here’s a step-by-step guide on designing your schema using Knack:\n• Log in to your Knack account or create a free trial.\n• Click on “New App” to initiate the app-building process.\n• Knack uses tables to represent your data entities.\n• Click on “Add Table” to create a new table.\n• Give your table a descriptive name that reflects the entity it represents (e.g., Customers, Products, Orders).\n• Each table will contain fields that represent the attributes of your entity.\n• Click on “Add Field” to define a new field.\n• Choose the appropriate data type for your field based on the information you want to store (e.g., Text for names, Number for prices, Date for order dates).\n• Give your field a clear and concise name that reflects its purpose (e.g., first_name, product_price, order_date).\n• Knack allows you to establish relationships between tables using connected fields.\n• To create a relationship, navigate to the table containing the “one” side of the relationship (e.g., the Customers table).\n• Select the table representing the “many” side of the relationship (e.g., Orders table). This creates a foreign key connection.\n• Choose the field in the “one” table that will be used for linking (e.g., customer_id in the Customers table).\n\nA well-designed relational database is a powerful tool, but like any tool, it needs proper maintenance. Here are best practices to keep your database running smoothly as your data volume and user base grow.\n• Indexing Key Fields: Indexes act like reference catalogs in a library, allowing for faster data retrieval. Identify frequently used columns in your queries and create indexes on those fields. This significantly improves query execution speed.\n• Optimize Queries: Write efficient SQL queries that avoid unnecessary operations or filtering conditions. Analyze slow queries and identify areas for improvement.\n• Hardware Optimization: Ensure your database server has sufficient resources (CPU, RAM) to handle the workload. Consider upgrading hardware if performance bottlenecks arise.\n• Denormalization (Strategic): In some cases, denormalization can improve read performance by duplicating certain data points across tables.\n• Archiving Old Data: Don’t overload your database with inactive or historical data. Regularly archive to keep your active tables lean and efficient.\n• Horizontal Scaling (Sharding): For massive datasets, consider horizontal scaling. This involves distributing data across multiple servers.\n• Choose the Right Database Engine: Select a database engine that fits your specific needs and anticipated data growth. Consider factors like performance, scalability, and available features.\n• Design for Growth: While building your schema, factor in potential future needs. Leave room for adding new tables or fields without compromising the overall structure.\n• Regular Monitoring: Proactively monitor your database performance and identify potential bottlenecks before they become critical issues. Regularly analyze query execution times, storage usage, and user activity.\n\nBuilding a relational database is an iterative process. Just like any software development project, thorough testing and continuous improvement can create a robust and user-friendly system.\n• Data Integrity: Testing helps identify data inconsistencies, invalid entries, and potential breaches of referential integrity. This ensures your data remains accurate and reliable.\n• Functionality: Verify that your database functions as intended. Test different queries, data manipulation operations, and user workflows to identify any bugs or shortcomings.\n• Performance: Evaluate the performance of your database under various load conditions. This helps pinpoint areas for optimization and ensures the system can handle real-world usage.\n• Unit Testing: Test individual components of your database schema, such as table structures and queries, in isolation. This helps isolate issues early in the development process.\n• Integration Testing: Test how different parts of your database interact with each other, ensuring smooth data flow and consistency across tables.\n• User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Involve your end-users in testing the database. Their feedback is invaluable for identifying usability issues and ensuring the system meets their needs effectively.\n\nChoosing and Setting Up Primary Fields in a Relational Database\n\nThe primary key is a fundamental concept in relational databases. It acts as a unique identifier for each row in a table, ensuring data integrity and efficient data retrieval. Choosing the right primary key is crucial for establishing a solid foundation for your database.\n• Uniqueness: The primary key value must be unique for every row in the table. No two rows can have the same primary key value.\n• Not Null: The primary key field should not allow null values. Every row must have a defined primary key value.\n• Simplicity and Efficiency: Ideally, the primary key should be concise and allow for efficient retrieval of data.\n• Auto-Incrementing Integers: This is a popular choice for primary keys. The database automatically generates a unique integer for each new row, ensuring uniqueness and simplicity. (e.g., customer_id in a Customers table)\n• Unique Natural Keys: In some cases, a natural attribute of an entity can serve as a unique identifier. For example, a Social Security number (assuming appropriate privacy considerations) could be a primary key in an Employee table, provided duplicates are strictly controlled.\n• Composite Keys: When no single attribute is inherently unique, a combination of two or more attributes can be used as a composite primary key. This is often used for tables linking multiple entities. (e.g., A combination of order_id and product_id in an Order_Details table linking Orders and Products tables)\n\nRelational databases require regular maintenance, so you may need to address issues in your design as your data needs evolve. Here’s how:\n• Data Redundancy: Avoid storing the same data in multiple places. Normalize your tables and use foreign keys to create relationships.\n• Performance Issues: Optimize queries, create indexes on frequently used fields, and consider hardware upgrades if needed.\n• Scalability Challenges: Plan for growth! Denormalize strategically, archive old data, and explore horizontal scaling for massive datasets.\n• Testing Oversights: Thoroughly test your database design! Involve users, identify bottlenecks, and iterate based on feedback.\n\nThis comprehensive guide has equipped you with the knowledge and best practices to navigate the world of relational databases. You’ve learned how to:\n• Define your data requirements and identify key entities and relationships.\n• Optimize your database for performance and scalability to handle growing needs.\n• Implement a rigorous testing and iteration process to ensure data integrity and user satisfaction.\n\nBuilding a database with Knack is far simpler than doing this from scratch. Following our “working with records” guide will give you everything you need to know about building your table, fields, and records to start building custom software applications.\n\nKnack uses tables and fields to define your data. Tables are used to separate your data into common groups. You can think of a table like a spreadsheet or a database table. Fields are used to define specific attributes of a table.

        "document": "Database modeling is a fundamental aspect of database design that involves visualising the data structures, relationships, and constraints within a database.\n\nRelational databases, the most widely used database, rely on this data modeling approach to organize information into tables, rows, and columns. The ER diagram serves as a blueprint, guiding the creation of these tables and their interconnections, ensuring data integrity and optimizing database performance.\n\nMastering the principles of database modeling, such as cardinality, entity types, and normalization, enables database professionals to design scalable and maintainable data structures that can meet the evolving needs of an organization. This blog will uncover all these aspects in detail.\n\nBuilding a well-designed database is crucial for the long-term success of any data-driven application. By following key principles of effective database modeling, you can ensure data integrity, optimize performance, and create a scalable foundation for your system. Some of the key principles of effective database modeling are discussed below:\n• Data Normalization: Normalize your data to eliminate redundancy and maintain data integrity.\n• Data Integrity: Enforce data integrity through the use of primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints. This ensures data consistency and accuracy across your database.\n• Database Optimization: Identify appropriate data types, create efficient indexing strategies, and denormalize when necessary to optimize query speeds.\n• Schema Design: Carefully plan your database schema, considering the relationships between entities. Use appropriate table structures and enforce referential integrity to maintain data consistency.\n• Table Relationships: Model the connections between your data entities accurately, using one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships as needed.\n\nHow to Identify Entities, Attributes, and Relationships in a Conceptual Data Model\n\nEntity-relationship modeling is a crucial step in the data modeling process. It involves identifying the key entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them. This conceptual data model forms the foundation for the logical and physical data models that follow.\n\nEntities represent the core “things” in the system, such as customers, products, or orders. Each entity has a set of attributes that describe its properties, like a customer’s name, email, or order date.\n\nRelationships capture how the entities interact with or relate to one another. For example, a customer can place many orders, and each order is associated with a single customer. The integrity and relationships of these data elements are essential for maintaining accurate and reliable data within the database.\n\nThe resulting conceptual model can then be translated into a logical model, which adds more technical detail, and ultimately a physical data model that aligns with the target database technology. This structured approach ensures the data architecture aligns with business needs.\n\nDatabase normalization is a crucial process in designing efficient and scalable databases. It involves organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. Here are the key normalization techniques that help optimize database performance:\n\nFirst Normal Form (1NF): This form ensures that all attributes in a table are atomic, meaning they cannot be further divided into smaller parts. It also requires that there are no repeating groups within the table.\n\nSecond Normal Form (2NF): In addition to 1NF, 2NF requires that all non-key attributes are fully dependent on the primary key. This helps eliminate partial dependencies and further reduce data redundancy.\n\nThird Normal Form (3NF): Building on 2NF, 3NF states that all non-key attributes must be independent of each other and depend only on the primary key. This helps eliminate transitive dependencies and improve data integrity.\n\nBoyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF): BCNF is a stricter version of 3NF, which ensures that every determinant (a set of attributes that uniquely identifies a row) is a candidate key. This helps eliminate certain types of anomalies and further optimize database performance.\n\nBest Practices to Keep in Mind During Data Modeling Process\n\nDesigning a robust and efficient database is crucial for the success of any application or system. Here are some best practices to keep in mind when designing your database:\n• Select data types that accurately represent the data and optimize storage and performance.\n• Utilize constraints, such as primary keys, and foreign keys, and check constraints, to maintain data consistency and accuracy.\n• Create appropriate indexes to improve query performance, especially for frequently accessed data.\n• Use clear and descriptive names for tables, columns, and other database objects to enhance readability and maintainability.\n• Design the database with expansion in mind, considering factors like data volume, transaction loads, and user base.\n• Analyze and optimize complex queries to ensure efficient data retrieval and processing.\n• Secure the database by applying access controls, encryption, and other security best practices.\n• Keep comprehensive documentation on the database design, schema changes, and any other relevant information to facilitate future maintenance and modifications.\n\nAlso, check out: Data modeling tools and techniques\n\nDatabase modeling is a crucial skill for professionals looking to excel in the field of data management and information systems. As the volume of data continues to grow, the demand for skilled database modellers has never been higher.\n\nUnderstanding various modeling techniques, such as hierarchical, relational, and non-relational databases, is essential for a successful career in database modeling.\n\nIn this section, we’ll explore the key steps to building a successful career in database modeling.\n\nWhile theoretical knowledge is important, hands-on experience is crucial for database modeling roles. Seek out internships or personal projects that allow you to apply your skills and build a portfolio of work.\n\nDatabase modeling is a dynamic field, with constant changes in tools, techniques, and best practices. Successful database modelers prioritize continuous learning and stay informed about the latest industry developments.\n\nKey certifications that are highly regarded in the field of database modeling include:\n\n1. Certified Data Modeler (CDM): Offered by the Data Management Association (DAMA), this certification validates an individual's proficiency in designing and implementing effective data models that align with business requirements.\n\n2.

        "document": "Data Modeler provides integrated support for using the Subversion versioning and source control system with Data Modeler designs. You can store designs in a Subversion repository to achieve the usual version control benefits, including:\n• Storing the \"official\" versions of designs in a central repository instead of in various folders or directories.\n• Enabling multiple developers to work on the same design, coordinating their changes through the traditional Subversion checkout and commit processes. The Data Modeler documentation does not provide detailed information about SVN concepts and operations; it assumes that you know them or can read about them. For information about Subversion, see . For Subversion documentation, see . To access the versioning features of Data Modeler, use the Team menu. If you create any versioning repositories or connect to any existing repositories, you can use the hierarchical display of repositories and their contents in the Versions navigator. (If that navigator is not visible, click Team, then Versions.) Before you can work with a Subversion repository through Data Modeler, you must create a connection to it. When you create a local Subversion repository, a connection to it is automatically created, and this can be seen in the Versions navigator. You can subsequently edit the connection details. Existing files must be imported into the Subversion repository to bring them under version control. Files are then checked out from the Subversion repository to a local folder known as the \"Subversion working copy\". Files created in Data Modeler must be stored in the Subversion working copy. Files newly created within Data Modeler must be added to version control. Changed and new files are made available to other users by committing them to the Subversion repository. The Subversion working copy can be updated with the contents of the Subversion repository to incorporate changes made by other users. The Pending Changes window is displayed if you click View, then Pending Changes, or when you initiate an action that changes the local source control status of a file. This window shows files that have been added, modified or removed (locally or remotely), files whose content conflicts with other versions of the same file files that have not been added to source control files that are being watched, and files for which editors have been obtained. You can use this information to detect conflicts and to resolve them where possible. The Outgoing Changes pane shows changes made locally, the Incoming Changes pane shows changes made remotely, and the Candidates pane shows files that have been created locally but not yet added to source control. You can double-click file names to edit them, and you can use the context menu to perform available operations. To use Subversion with a Data Modeler design, you must have the following:\n• A folder or directory on your local system to serve as the working directory for the design. You create the design in this working directory, save the design to this working directory, and open the design from this working directory.\n• A Subversion repository to which you can connect, and in which you can create under a branch for the initial version of the design (and later any subsequent versions). The following are suggested basic steps. They are not the only possible steps or necessarily the \"best\" steps for a given project. These steps reflect the use of the Versions navigator and the Import wizard within Data Modeler to perform many actions; however, many actions can alternatively be performed using a separate SVN repository browser (such as the TortoiseSVN browser) and using SVN commands on your local system.\n• On your local system, create a directory or folder to serve as the parent for design-specific working directories. For example, on a Windows PC create:\n• On your local system, create a directory or folder under the one in the preceding step to serve as the working directory for the design you plan to create. For example, for a design to be named , create:\n• In Data Modeler, create the design (for example, the library design in Data Modeler Tutorial: Modeling for a Small Database), and save the design to the working directory that you created. For example, save the design to: Saving the design causes the file and the related directory structure to be created in the working directory. (The file and the directory structure are explained in Database Design.)\n• Close the design. (Do not exit Data Modeler.)\n• Create an SVN connection to the repository that you want to use.\n• In the Versions navigator, right-click the top-level node (Subversion) and select New Repository Connection.\n• In the Subversion: Create/Edit Subversion Connection dialog box, complete the information. Example repository URL:\n• \n• In the Versions navigator, right-click the repository path and select New Remote Directory.\n• In the Subversion: Create Remote Directory dialog box, complete the information, specifying the Directory Name as .\n• \n• In the Versions navigator, right-click the directory and select New Remote Directory.\n• In the Subversion: Create Remote Directory dialog box, complete the information. Example Directory Name: For example, if you plan to create the library design in Data Modeler Tutorial: Modeling for a Small Database, the URL in the repository for this branch might be:\n• Use the Subversion: Import to Subversion wizard to import the design files into the repository. Click Team, then Import Files, and complete the wizard pages as follows.\n• Destination: Specify the SVN connection and the repository path into which to import the files. Example:\n• Source: Specify the source directory from which to import the files (that is, the directory containing the .dmd file and the design-specific folder hierarchy). Example:\n• Filters: Accept the defaults and click Next.\n• Options: Accept the defaults and click Next.\n• The SVN Console Log shows the progress as files are added. After the files are added, the Handle New Files dialog box is displayed.\n• In the Handle New Files dialog box, select Do Not Open Files and click OK.\n• To see the files that have been added, click the Refresh icon in the Versions navigator tab. For subsequent work on the design, follow the usual workflow for Subversion-based projects (SVN Update, SVN Lock, modify files, SVN Commit)."

        "document": "Even though the concept of data modeling has been around for a long time, in many organizations it is interpreted differently. A data model is a set of data specifications and related diagrams that reflect data requirements and designs. Generally, conceptual data modeling and logical data modeling are requirements analysis activities, while physical data modeling is a design activity. All are parts of an enterprise data model.\n\nThe Logical Data Model refers to a higher level of data – the business data. Once the business data requirements are known and modeled in a logical data model, the physical data model and database design can proceed. However, if there is no clear understanding of the business requirements all the design and implementation work in the world will not result in a good quality application.\n\nData is the most important part of any application or system. A good, strong, accurate data structure allows application developers to design any processing, user interface, reporting, or statistical analysis ever needed. The only things more important in developing application systems than a quality data structure are the business rules and requirements. The most elegant, highly technical system in the world will be abandoned if it does not meet business requirements. Therefore, logical data modeling combines the two most important components of application development: business requirements and quality data structure.\n\nA logical data model is a graphical representation of the information requirements of a business area; it is not a database.\n\nThe word logical is critical because it modifies the phrase data modeling to a more specific activity. A logical data model is independent of a physical, data storage device (database management system, file system, etc). This is the key concept of the logical data model. A logical data model must be independent of technology since technology changes so rapidly.\n\nIt is dangerous for application developers to continue to gather requirements with a specific technology in mind. The problem with legacy applications continues to grow and multiply in complexity. Applications should be as independent of technology as possible. Build a system that is independent of technology; isn’t this an oxymoron? Yes and No. There are components of an application that are linked intimately to the technology: the programs, the database management systems, and the screen components. There are also components of the system that can be technology independent: the logical data model, the logical process model, the business rules and other relevant business metadata. These components are connected to the business, not the technology.\n\nMost business areas evolve more slowly than technology. Consider industries operating for 100-200 years: an enterprise data governance model captures their core functions that remain stable despite technological changes. An insurance company’s fundamental processes – providing coverage, receiving payments, and paying claims – have remained constant throughout its history, even as execution moved from paper to mainframes, PCs, networks, and the Internet. This distinction between WHAT the business requirements are and HOW they are accomplished illustrates the difference between a logical data model and physical database.\n\nThe logical data model is a picture of all the pieces of information necessary to run the business. The logical data model is built using an Entity Relationship diagram (ERD) – a standard modeling technique used by data modelers around the world. Entity relationship diagramming is a structured technique used as a communication tool. It includes the complete business requirements without reference to any technical components.\n\nThe components of a logical data model include Entities, Relationships, and Attributes. Each Entity represents a set of persons, things, or concepts about which the business needs information. Each Relationship represents an association between two entities. Each Attribute is a characteristic or piece of information that further describes an entity. A name and a textual definition describe each of these components. These name and definitions provide ongoing documentation of the business rules and information requirements of the business area. They describe what the business requirements are, not how they are implemented, stored, or processed.\n\nWho Uses the Logical Data Model?\n\nIn most organizations, the logical data models are the responsibility of a Data Architecture team, with input from each business unit. Each business unit has subject matter experts who describe their data requirements to the data modeler and review the models created. They use the models for impact analysis of changes to business requirements. The Data Modeler conducts facilitated sessions with subject matter experts to gather the data requirements and build the logical data model. The data modeler also works with the process analyst to link data with processes. The data modeler is responsible for getting approval of the logical data model from the subject matter experts and then works with the DBA to transition the logical model to the physical model. In many cases, the logical data modeler and the process analyst are the same person, but different tools and techniques are used in data and process modeling. An expert logical data modeler is trained in gathering rules and data and synthesizing the essential elements from the non-essential to display the business needs in an Entity Relationship diagram and supporting documentation. An expert data modeler’s skills are independent of any specific database management system’s techniques.\n\nThe Database Administrator (DBA) builds the physical data model from the logical data model. To create a good quality database design, the database administrator reviews the logical model to select technology-appropriate keys, create indexes, detail data types, and build referential integrity to protect the data values. The database administrator may de-normalize the database for efficiency. DBA’s also are responsible for writing stored procedures, triggers, maintaining referential integrity, and monitoring database performance.\n\nWhat is the Difference Between a Logical Data Model and a Physical Database Design?\n\nReviewing the information in the table below, one could gloss over the importance of the differences between the models. Many people carelessly interchange the word entity with the word table. However, the distinction is significant. An entity represents a set of persons, things, or concepts that are important to the business. A table is a data structure that contains data values and is physically stored on a medium using a specific DBMS. The difference is the link to technology. An entity has no link to technology; a table is a technology.\n\nAlso, consider the difference between a unique identifier in the logical model and a primary key in the physical model. A unique identifier represents the data element(s) used by the business to discriminate between one occurrence of an entity and another. How do you tell the difference between one CUSTOMER and another? A subject matter expert may answer this question: ‘Customer Name’. This is an important business requirement and must be captured as such.\n\nHowever, most database designers would not select Customer Name as a primary key. In the physical model, a primary key, such as a computer-generated Customer ID, is selected because it uniquely identifies each row in the table and can serve as a foreign key in related tables.\n\nThe most important reason to build a logical data model is to confirm the users’ and analysts’ understanding of the business requirements to assure that the system developed satisfies the business need. Logical data modeling provides the analyst with a tool and technique to conduct analysis. Most subject matter experts can articulate problems, and often, solutions. Unfortunately, their problems and solutions are often based on current system constraints, not true business needs. Assuming perfect technology forces users and analysts to look beyond the current system limitations. Asking the business people to detail every piece of data (attributes), requires them to understand and articulate every aspect of their business. This process allows the business to drive the application / solution, not the other way around. It also stimulates discussion and thoughts. By identifying and detailing data in a model, further requirements and problem areas arise simply because of discussing and reviewing the model.\n\nA logical data model is a foundation for designing a database that supports the business requirements. Database designers start their design with a complete picture of the business requirements and can then determine the best implementation approach. Doing so allows designers to use their expertise in data access paths, data distribution and placement, and access efficiency to create a database that will satisfy business requirements for years to come.\n\nA logical data model also facilitates data re-use and sharing. Data is stable over time; therefore, the model remains stable over time. As additional project teams define their needs, they can re-use model components that are shared by various parts of the business. This leads to physical data sharing and less storage of redundant data. It also helps the organization recognize that information is an organization-wide resource, not the property of one department or another. Data sharing makes the organization more cohesive and increases the quality of service to outside customers and suppliers.\n\nBuilding and maintaining a logical data model decreases system development and maintenance time and cost. Identifying all business requirements and rules at the beginning of a project makes the design, coding, testing, and implementation phases go much smoother and faster. A model is easier and cheaper to modify during the development life cycle. Mistakes, missed data, and misinterpretations are less costly when corrected in a model than in an implemented application. It also decreases user requests for changes.\n\nWhen changes are necessary, the logical model can be used for impact analysis. A logical data model, documented in an Entity Relationship diagram, is a picture of the business area. Every entity, attribute, and relationship created and defined in the model is a piece of the resulting system documentation. The objects in the model contain textual definitions that describe their characteristics in business language. Because of data modeling, system documentation can become easier to produce.\n\nA logical data model confirms a logical process model and provides documentation of the information requirements of the business area for ongoing impact analysis. Each business process and rule is tied to the logical data model to assure that all data and process model components have been discovered.\n\nIssues When a Logical Data Model is not Developed\n\nWhen users are not asked to focus on data as a critical part of a new system design, they talk about processes and activities. They may forget to tell designers about all data requirements. Traditionally designers create tables and files based on screen and report layouts, searching out data elements as they go. These data elements are not well organized or structured properly. Designing a model based on physical workflow could result in a model that does not fully represent the business requirements. This can occur when the technology of the workflow is forced into the physical model. Often the result is a database that is missing critical data and must be changed immediately after implementation.\n\nThe database design task is a much longer activity and the database may be poorly structured without a logical data model as a guide. If not all business data requirements have been thoroughly identified and defined, database designs will be unstable throughout the development process. During coding, testing and even implementation, developers can find additional data elements, requiring the DBAs to be re-active instead of pro-active. Resulting non-modeled databases may be poorly structured, looking like a patchwork quilt, rather than being well planned and easy to maintain. Errors in the database design will cause the entire system to be unusable.\n\nSystem documentation may not be created, or it may be sparse, or it is textual vs. text with graphics and difficult to maintain. User requirements are lengthy, textual documents that are time consuming to review. Without a logical model to refer to, data definition language must be referenced when planning system enhancements. DBMS systems often limit the length of column names making them difficult to decipher.\n\nAn ERD is a structured, graphical document that describes the business supported by the system. It can be used to identify business rules, which must be fully documented before application development can begin.\n\nLogical data modeling forces analysts to think about the current business requirements, independent of technology, thereby highlighting opportunities for business process improvement rather than simply automating an existing procedure or recreating a legacy system on a new platform. Users who understand their current systems can prevent analysts from identifying incorrect business requirements. The main reason for missed target dates is a poor understanding of the business requirements. Building a complete, essential, logical data model (and linking it to an essential process model) forces the analysts and the business users to completely describe all information requirements of the business area. Without this rigorous analysis, data elements will be missed or defined improperly, causing poor database design and ineffective application development efforts.\n\nA logical data model is a crucial and essential part of every application development project and should proceed every database design. A logical data model should form the basis for a physical data model and serve as the foundation for recording business requirements and metadata. Using data modeling standard notation and applying proven techniques for data modeling will provide organizations that perform logical data modeling with many tangible and intangible benefits."

        "document": "Knowing how to create a data model is the first step toward building a successful app. This is the foundation of how you’ll transform your business requirements into reality.\n\nIn fact, all other elements of your app build on your data model.\n\nHowever, coming up with an effective data model presents a few key challenges. This is a complex process, involving end-users, technical teams, and other business stakeholders.\n\nToday, we’re going to look at exactly how you can create a successful data model.\n\nBudibase is the fast, easy way to connect to just about any data source and build professional UIs in minutes.\n\nFirst thing’s first, let’s start with the basics.\n\nA data model is an abstract overview of how your app stores, connects to, organizes, and manages data. This includes the values you need, where they come from, and how they’re structured.\n\nThis is distinct from a database schema, in a couple of ways:\n• Your data model design encompasses how data is structured across all sources, whereas the schema typically only applies to a single source.\n• The data model is more concerned with how data is structured in abstract terms, rather than the technical details of each individual source.\n\nData modeling is the process of creating a model based on your real-world data requirements.\n\nThe goal of data model creation is to build a framework for how your application will handle and process data. This then forms the basis of building out your app’s automation processes and user interfaces.\n\nWhy do you need a data model?\n\nPerhaps a better question is ‘why do you need to explicitly build a data model?’ Every app has a data model. It’s really just a question of whether or not you’ve put the thought into creating the most effective one for your needs.\n\nThis impacts your information systems’ security, functionality, performance, scalability, and usability, to name just a few factors.\n\nAs such, it pays to get your data model right the first time around.\n\nThis is especially true when pulling data from sources within a single application. For example, some of the information you need might be contained in external sources, alongside an internal database.\n\nA large part of developing a data model is establishing the data you’ll need, and where it will come from.\n\nHaving an effective data model in place also allows you to ensure compatibility between multiple sources, optimum performance, scalability, and effective security within your data warehouse or other information assets.\n\nHow to create a data model for your app project in 9 steps\n\nTo ensure the best results, it’s useful to follow a reproducible framework.\n\nHere are the specific steps you can follow to build the perfect data model for your next app project, along with all of the key things you’ll need to consider along the way.\n\nThe first step is gathering business requirements for how your application will process data. At this stage, requirements can be fairly general, and we don’t need to worry about specific variables just yet.\n\nEssentially, gathering requirements means figuring out what your app will actually do, and a broad overview of what data you’ll need to achieve this.\n\nThis means engaging with different business stakeholders, including end-users, decision-makers, clients, and technical colleagues, to establish an overview of the app’s required functionality.\n\nFor example, if we were building an employee timesheet app, our high-level requirements would look something like this:\n• Employees should be able to log hours against different projects.\n• Project owners should be able to monitor time usage.\n• Project owners should be able to query and approve timesheet submissions.\n• The application should offer integration with CRM and billing platforms.\n\nOf course, these are just a few illustrative examples of the kinds of requirements that we might settle on.\n\nNext, we can start fleshing out our requirements into more specific processes. This means outlining what the application should do in response to different events and triggers. This includes system processes, as well as responses to user actions.\n\nAgain, we still want to do this in abstract terms, without worrying about specific variables.\n\nThis step is also known as creating a logical data model.\n\nLater, we’ll use this information to build a more concrete data structure that deals more granularly with specific data elements - including relationships between data objects.\n\nFor now, though, we can simply outline our desired processes using non-technical, business language.\n\nFor example, we could outline the following business processes for our timesheet example:\n• The application should calculate labor costs for all timesheet submissions.\n• Project managers should be notified when an employee submits a relevant timesheet.\n• Project managers should be able to view the status of each project, in terms of expenditure and time usage.\n• Employees should be able to edit only their own submissions. Project managers should be able to edit any relevant submissions.\n• The system should integrate with external platforms to generate and send invoices, based on project timesheets.\n\nAgain, these are just a few examples of business rules. The goal of logical modeling is to flesh out the different actions users can take, and how our application will respond, along with any other processes it might conduct in the background.\n\nThen we can start planning the data we’ll need to achieve this.\n\nThe next step is to create a conceptual data model. This is a more structured plan for the data we’ll need to implement the processes we identified in the previous step. For now, we’ll carry on using non-technical, business terminology. The more specific technical details come later in other types of data models.\n\nCreating a conceptual model is all about figuring out how different kinds of data will be structured to meet our goals.\n\nThe first step here is to decide the broad entities our data will consist of. Then we can outline the information that we need to know about each of these and start drawing up general links between them.\n\nSo, in our timesheets app example, our entities would need to include:\n\nDepending on your business, you could add extra entities. For example, individual tasks within projects, or other resources you need to implement them.\n\nNext, we’ll create a brief outline of the kinds of data we’ll store for each entity. For example, your employee’s personal and professional details, and hourly rates, or the requirements, budget, and goals of each project.\n\nFinally, your conceptual model should include an overview of how different entities are related. For example, each project has one owner, each employee can submit multiple timesheets, et cetera.\n\nOnce we’ve identified our entities, we can start to define them more closely. The most common way to do this is to translate each entity into a distinct database table. Here, the rows will represent each individual instance of our entity, like a specific employee or project.\n\nEach column will represent a specific attribute we want to store for each of our entities. This means we need to decide:\n• The specific variables we need to know,\n• And any rules we’ll apply to them.\n\nIf you decide that you need to create a new database for your application, this will form part of your schema. If you’re going to rely on existing data, you’ll need to take this into account when choosing your sources.\n\nCheck out our in-depth guide, what is a database schema , to find out more.\n\nA large part of your data model is actually figuring out where values will come from, and how they should be stored for your app to function properly. This means identifying your app’s data sources.\n\nNote that these are the main sources of existing data that we can use. We can also add or update values within them by sending queries from our finished app, depending on the data modeling techniques we want to use.\n\nOne of the key tasks here is deciding whether to create entirely new data sources or to rely on existing ones. Of course, we can build our data model around a combination of both.\n\nOften, there are different options available to achieve similar results.\n\nLet’s think about the different ways we could structure the data sources for our employee timesheet.\n\nThe simplest option would be to build a dedicated internal database around the entities we already identified. This would offer us the most control over how our attributes and entities are structured and stored, as we’d have to create our own database schema from scratch.\n\nHowever, this would also make integration with other platforms a little bit more complicated.\n\nWe could also connect to an existing, external database, either directly, or using an API.\n\nThat is, assuming that a suitable database exists. Naturally, this saves us going to the effort of creating our own. It also makes it easy to integrate with any other tools that already query the same data.\n\nThe downside is that the schemas of existing databases might not match our needs. In this case, we’d need to transform query outputs to format the data in a way that meets our requirements.\n\nOften, we’ll need to do a combination of the two. So, in our timesheet app, we might pull employee details and project information from external sources, but create an internal database to store user inputs for timesheet submissions.\n\nWe’ve also created a guide on how to integrate multiple databases .\n\nEarlier, we briefly touched on how to define relationships between different entities within our data model. Now that we have a firmer, technical view of our entities, we can establish more specific relationships between them.\n\nThere are a few different things to keep abreast of here.\n\nFirst of all, it’s important to choose the correct kind of relationship for each set of entities. There are a few options here:\n\nWe’ll also need to decide which columns in each table to build the relationships around. The specifics here will depend on your DBMS.\n\nFor example, within a single SQL database, you’ll need to define primary keys for each row in a given table. These are unique values, used by other tables to reference related rows. When a primary key appears in a related table, it’s what’s known as a foreign key.\n\nIf your data model contains multiple databases, you’ll need to take additional steps to establish relationships. For example, building an internal database, so you can query and store entities from different sources.\n\nNext, it’s time to create a physical data model. This includes the more specific detail of how you’ll structure any internal databases, and how you’ll connect to external data sources.\n\nAs such, creating a physical model essentially means putting the previous steps into practice.\n\nIf you’re creating your own database design for your app, this means defining specific names for all of your attributes, as well as their types, formats, integrity constraints, and any other rules governing them.\n\nCheck out our guide to database schemas for more information\n\nWhen working with external data sources, we’ll also have to think about how we connect these to our app. One way to do this is to manually point to the source’s name, location, authentication details, and other information in our app’s code.\n\nWith low-code tools and other newer app-building platforms, we can also use dedicated data connectors.\n\nThese are dedicated interfaces for establishing a connection to specific kinds of external data. Rather than manually creating the necessary code, you can simply input the required information in a GUI.\n\nDepending on the tool and data source, you can then manually create the queries you need, or import all available queries provided by the source.\n\n8. Normalization and ensuring the integrity of data\n\nOne of your major goals, when you create a data model, is to ensure the long-term validity, reliability, and integrity of your app’s data. This includes avoiding redundancy, conflicting values, formatting issues, and more.\n\nOne way to do this is through data normalization.\n\nNormalization is a topic in itself. Essentially this is a set of strategies you can use to prevent redundancy and anomalies as you maintain data.\n\nThere are many techniques available to you here.\n\nThe most common relates to how you structure your data in the first place. More specifically, the goal is to create entities, that each deal with one specific theme or idea. If you’ve followed the advice we’ve given so far, this will already be built into your data model.\n\nThe rule here is that any time a group of values could apply to more than one row on a table, you should consider creating a dedicated entity for these, and using relationships to link it to the original table.\n\nThis improves performance, as well as lowering the storage space we need.\n\nFor example, in an employee directory, we could have attributes called department_name, department_phone, and department_head stored against each individual employee row.\n\nThis would mean we’d have to store the exact same information multiple times across the employee_details table.\n\nIt would also be unnecessarily difficult to list all of the company’s departments or change their details.\n\nA better solution would therefore to create a dedicated departments table and link the relevant row to each employee’s entry. This provides easier querying, and maintenance, as well as reducing the load on your servers.\n\nTake a look at our guide to CAP vs ACID to learn more.\n\nEven once your data model is implemented, there’s still the issue of maintaining it. This poses several challenges, especially when it comes to scaling your application. For instance, when it comes to growing your data set and adding new functionality to the app itself.\n\nIt’s crucial that you can respond to change, without undermining your data model.\n\nThis can mean adding objects, altering existing ones, modifying relationships, or changing individual attributes.\n\nThe key is ensuring that your data model is easily adaptable when change is required. For example, if you need to add new functionality, entities, attributes, processes, or relationships.\n\nThat is, you must be able to make your required changes, without compromising other elements of your data. For instance, a change to one attribute might inadvertently impact another, through a transitive dependency.\n\nSo for example, you might need to alter the format of a particular attribute to implement support for a new third-party tool. In doing so, there’s a danger that you could break any other elements of your data model that depend on this attribute.\n\nIt’s crucial to put steps in place to prevent this.\n\nBeyond this, there’s the challenge of ensuring you have adequate server capacity to facilitate growth, both in terms of storage space and user numbers. Adequate planning for this during the modeling stage helps to prevent the need for data migrations later.\n\nFor a more practical example, check out our tutorial on workflow management database design .\n\nYou might also like our round-up of the top Airtable alternatives .\n\nThere are countless data modeling tools on the market today.

        "document": "Indexing in PostgreSQL is a process that involves creating data structures that are optimized to efficiently search and retrieve data from tables.\n\nAn index is a copy of a portion of a table, arranged in a way that enables PostgreSQL to quickly locate and retrieve rows that match a particular query condition.\n\nWhen a query is executed, PostgreSQL looks at the indexes available to determine if any of them can be used in satisfying the query condition. If it finds a relevant index, PostgreSQL employs it to quickly identify the corresponding rows in the table. This results in significantly speedy queries, especially in situations where tables are large or the conditions are complex.\n\nPostgreSQL provides support for several index types, including B-tree, hash, GiST, SP-GiST, and BRIN. Each index type is tailored to cater to distinct query types and data access patterns.\n\nApart from the standard index types, PostgreSQL permits users to define custom indexes utilizing user-defined functions.\n\nIt's important to note that creating an index requires additional disk space and can impact the performance of write operations, such as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. Because of this, it's essential to consider the trade-offs and carefully choose which columns to index based on the queries you frequently execute and the access patterns of your data.\n\nB-tree index is the most commonly used type of index to efficiently store and retrieve data in PostgreSQL. It's the default index type. Whenever we use the command without specifying the type of index we want, PostgreSQL will create a B-tree index for the table or column.\n\nA B-tree index is organized in a tree-like structure. The index starts with a root node, with pointers to child nodes. Each node in the tree typically contains multiple key-value pairs, where the keys are used for indexing, and the values point to the corresponding data in the table.\n\nTo create a B-tree index in PostgreSQL, use the statement. Here’s the syntax:\n\nTo create a single B-tree index based on one table column instead of creating an index on the entire table, the syntax is as follows.\n\nis the name you want to give to the index.\n\nis the name of the table on which you want to create the index.\n\nis the name of the column(s) on which you want to create the index.\n\nInsert values into the table using the statement:\n\nIf we create a B-tree index on the sales_id column by running this statement:\n\nWhen we run the statement, we get the total query runtime below.\n\nThe time displayed might look insignificant, as the table we are working with is small. But when working with a large amount of data, this will significantly improve the performance of your queries.\n\nTo learn more about the B-Tree index and the behaviors of B-Tree operator classes, see the official documentation here.\n\nHash indexes are designed for fast key-value lookups. When a query condition requires equality checks on indexed columns, hash indexes can provide extremely fast retrieval, as the hash function directly determines the location of the desired data. Hash indexes are most suitable for equality comparisons, such as or operations.\n\nLike other index types, hash indexes need to be maintained during data modifications (inserts, updates, and deletes) to ensure data consistency. But hash index maintenance can be more expensive than B-tree indexes due to the need to resolve collisions and rehash data.\n\nTo create a hash index in PostgreSQL, you can use the statement with the clause. For example:\n\nThis statement creates a hash index named \"hash_name\" on the specified column of the table.\n\nPoint to note here: while hash indexes are available in PostgreSQL, they are not suitable for range queries or sorting. B-tree indexes are typically preferred for such scenarios. Again, B-tree indexes are the default and commonly used index type.\n\nHash indexes have specific use cases and limitations, and it's essential to assess your requirements and query patterns before deciding on the appropriate index type for your PostgreSQL database.\n\nCreate a Hash index on the table using HASH for the column :\n\nSelect and filter the data using the clause:\n\nCheck out the official documentation if you want to dive deeper into Hash Indexes.\n\nGiST (Generalized Search Tree) and SP-GiST (Space-Partitioned Generalized Search Tree) indexes are advanced index types in PostgreSQL that provide support for a wide range of data types and search operations.\n\nThey are particularly useful for handling complex data structures and spatial data, GiST indexes are what you use if you want to speed up full-text searches.\n\nTo create a GiST or SP-GiST index in PostgreSQL, you can use the statement with the or clause, respectively.\n\nHere's an example of creating a GiST index on a geometry column:\n\nAnd here's an example of creating an SP-GiST index on a tsvector column:\n\nHere's an overview of GiST and SP-GiST indexes in PostgreSQL:\n• Generalized Search Tree (GiST) indexes are versatile index structures that support various data types beyond simple scalar values.\n• GiST indexes enable efficient searching and retrieval for complex data structures such as geometric objects, text documents, arrays, and more.\n• They are based on the concept of multidimensional trees, allowing for flexible search operations.\n• GiST indexes can handle different search predicates, including equality, range, and spatial operations like overlaps, containment, and distance-based searches.\n• Space-Partitioned Generalized Search Tree (SP-GiST) indexes are an extension of GiST indexes that further enhance indexing capabilities.\n• SP-GiST indexes are designed for data types with space-filling characteristics, such as multi-dimensional data, time-series data, and network data.\n• They partition the index space into non-overlapping regions, optimizing search performance for specific access patterns.\n• SP-GiST indexes provide support for various data types, including geometric objects, text search, and more.\n• They are particularly efficient for spatial indexing and can handle complex spatial queries, including intersection, nearest-neighbor, and clustering operations.\n\nSee the official documentation GiST and SP-GiST indexes for more information.\n\nBRIN, or Block Range Index, is an index type in PostgreSQL designed to provide efficient indexing for large tables with sorted data. BRIN index contains the minimum and maximum in a group of database pages.\n\nBRIN index makes is the easiest way to optimize for speed. It is particularly useful for data that exhibits sequential or sorted characteristics, such as time series data or data with a natural ordering.\n\nHere’s an overview of the BRIN Index:\n• BRIN indexes divide the table into logical blocks and store summary information about each block.\n• Each block contains a range of values, and the index stores the minimum and maximum values within each block.\n• Instead of storing individual index entries for each row, BRIN indexes store block-level summaries, making them smaller in size compared to other index types.\n• BRIN indexes work well when the data is sorted or when sequential scans are more efficient than index scans.\n\nTo create a BRIN index in PostgreSQL, you use the statement with the clause.\n\nHere's an example of creating a BRIN index on a timestamp column:\n\nThe above statement creates a BRIN index on the specified timestamp column of the table.\n\nHere are some things to consider when creating a BRIN Index:\n• BRIN indexes are most effective when the data is sorted or exhibit natural ordering.\n• They may not be suitable for tables with highly unsorted or non-sequential data.\n• BRIN indexes are generally used for read-intensive workloads where sequential scans are prevalent.\n• Regular maintenance and periodic reindexing may be necessary to ensure optimal performance.\n\nTo read more on BRIN Indexes, you can check out the official documentation.\n\nIn this quick guide, we have seen other types of indexes supported by PostgreSQL other than the B-Tree index.\n\nIt is not recommended to create an index on the fly just before running a one-off query. Creating a well-designed index requires careful planning and testing.\n\nIt's important to consider that indexes consume disk space. Also, whenever new data rows are inserted or existing rows are updated, the database automatically updates the corresponding index entries."

        "document": "Efficient data retrieval is essential for achieving peak PostgreSQL application performance, particularly when dealing with vast datasets. Databases offer a robust solution in the form of indexing, a mechanism that accelerates the retrieval of specific rows. This article will explore PostgreSQL indexing, starting with a general introduction and building up to the best practices for optimizing index performance.\n\nThis article is the third of our four-part series on PostgreSQL performance tuning. If you missed the first chapters of our guide, check out Part I (on database sizing) and Part II (on key PostgreSQL parameters you may want to fine-tune) .\n\nWhat Are Indexes in PostgreSQL?\n\nAt its core, a PostgreSQL index serves as a data structure designed to speed up data retrieval operations within a database table. Think of it as the table of contents in a book. Instead of painstakingly searching through the entire book to pinpoint a particular topic, you can swiftly navigate to the relevant page using the table of contents.\n\nSimilarly, in PostgreSQL, indexes act like a GPS for the database engine, enabling it to efficiently locate and retrieve specific rows without scanning the entire table. Simply put, an index is a pointer to data within a table.\n\nThese database indexes are standalone data structures that reside on disk alongside data tables and other related catalog objects. Sometimes, when all the data required for a query is in an index, Postgres can employ an scan and never have to touch the table.\n\nLeveraging indexes in PostgreSQL provides several key advantages.\n\nIndexes are instrumental in drastically slashing the time needed to retrieve data, particularly from large tables. Without indexes, a complete table scan would be required, which can be quite time-consuming. For example, without an index, data retrieval is based on the object's key. While this can be quick for direct lookups, it's inefficient for complex queries or partial matches, which PostgreSQL handles gracefully with indexes.\n\nQueries that include conditions in the WHERE clause or require table joins see marked improvements in performance with indexing. Such queries leverage indexes to quickly pinpoint rows that fulfill the set criteria.\n\nIndexes store a subset of the table's data, resulting in a reduction of disk I/O operations. This reduction not only expedites query execution but also reduces the burden on the storage system.\n\nUnique indexes act as safeguards against duplicate values within specific columns, thereby maintaining data integrity by ensuring no two rows have identical values in the designated columns.\n\nDespite PostgreSQL indexes offering remarkable benefits in query performance, there are some potential pitfalls to using indexes in PostgreSQL. It's crucial to judiciously balance these advantages against potential drawbacks, especially in situations where storage efficiency and write performance are key considerations.\n\nThe most obvious downside of utilizing indexes is the extra storage space they require. The precise amount depends on the size of the table and the number of indexed columns. Usually, it's a small fraction of the total table size. However, for large datasets, adding multiple indexes can lead to a significant increase in storage usage.\n\nEvery time a row is inserted, updated, or deleted, the index must be updated too. As a result, write operations may become slower. It's crucial to balance read and write operations when considering index usage. If your application relies heavily on write operations, the benefits of faster reads should be carefully weighed against the cost of slower writes.\n\nPostgreSQL employs a mechanism called Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) for updates. However, indexes can lead to \"HOT\" (Heap-Only Tuples) updates. Instead of allowing direct in-place updates, each update operation effectively results in a new row version, generating a new entry in each associated index. This leads to increased I/O activity and the addition of dead rows in the database.\n\nAn apparent one is the consumption of extra storage space: every index you add to a table requires its own separate storage allocation. At a fundamental level, an index comprises the values of the indexed columns and a reference (or pointer) to the actual row in the table.\n\nFor smaller datasets, the space used by indexes typically constitutes a small percentage of the total table size. However, as the size of your PostgreSQL tables grows, so does the size of its associated indexes. Sizes can become an obstacle when multiple columns are indexed or the indexed columns contain textual or string data. Unlike fixed-size data types like integers or dates, strings can vary in length, meaning that the index has to accommodate not only the string values but also metadata indicating the length of each string, thereby increasing the space overhead.\n\nPostgreSQL table partitioning adds another layer of complexity. Partitioning is a technique used to enhance the performance and maintenance of large tables by splitting them into smaller, more manageable pieces while still treating them as a single logical entity .\n\nIn Timescale, all are automatically partitioned by time. When a large table is partitioned, each partition is a table unto itself; if indexes are applied to the partitioned table, they are effectively applied to each partition separately. So, if you have hundreds or thousands of partitions, each with its own index, the cumulative storage used by these indexes can rise quickly.\n\nPostgres supports many index types, from the default b-tree indexes to more exotic types like hash, GIN, GiST, or BRIN. They are well documented in the PostgreSQL docs , but here’s a quick summary:\n• None Supports <, <=, =, >=, >, BETWEEN, IN, IS NULL, IS NOT NULL.\n• None Ideal for equality checks, especially for integers.\n• None Optimize based on columns frequently used in WHERE clauses.\n• None Built over a subset of a table, defined by a conditional expression.\n• None Useful for filtering out frequently unqueried rows.\n• None Allows index-only scans when the select list matches index columns.\n• None Additional columns are specified with the INCLUDE keyword.\n• None GiST (Generalized Search Tree) supports indexing of complex data types such as geometric shapes and full-text documents.\n• None Allows for custom operators for querying, supporting advanced search functionalities like natural language processing.\n• None Uses \"lossy\" indexing strategies to summarize complex items, potentially leading to false positives that require detailed row checks.\n• None SP-GiST (Space Partitioned Generalized Search Tree) is ideal for data with natural partitioning, such as spatial and hierarchical data.\n• None Enables different branching factors at different nodes, allowing tailored tree structures that reduce search space.\n• None Particularly efficient for applications requiring complex spatial queries or managing large data hierarchies.\n\nHow Can I Know Whether my PostgreSQL Indexes Are Working Efficiently?\n\nDetermining whether your PostgreSQL indexes need optimization requires ongoing monitoring via a multi-faceted approach. Indexes are not a \"set and forget\" in PostgreSQL; as your workload evolves, they will require maintenance to ensure your database runs optimally.\n\nThankfully, PostgreSQL comes with great tools and techniques you can use to monitor your indexes. Let’s cover some of the most rewarding strategies you can follow to identify if your indexes might not be functioning as intended.\n\nIf you want to spot potentially unused or underutilized indexes, is your friend. You can look at the column, which counts the number of index scans initiated on each index.\n\nSELECT relname AS table_name, indexrelname AS index_name, pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(indexrelid)) AS index_size, idx_scan AS index_scan_count FROM pg_stat_user_indexes WHERE idx_scan < 50 -- Choose a threshold that makes sense for your application. ORDER BY index_scan_count ASC, pg_relation_size(indexrelid) DESC;\n\nIn the example above, we're looking for indexes with fewer than 50 scans (which is an arbitrary number for this example—you should adjust it based on your application's usage patterns and the duration since the last statistics reset; also, if you have daily or weekly batch jobs, ensure you're not prematurely dropping indexes that are used by those less frequent tasks).\n\nMonitoring shared_blks_read and blk_read_time to identify if a new index may be needed\n\nThe view can help you to identify slow queries that may benefit from additional indexing via the metrics and . indicates the number of disk blocks read from shared memory; a high value for this parameter suggests that the system is reading a significant amount of data directly from the disk.\n\nrepresents the total time spent reading these blocks, measured in milliseconds. A high value indicates that not only is the system reading a lot of blocks from the disk, but it's also spending a significant amount of time doing so.\n\nIf you notice higher values of and associated with an important query, it signals that PostgreSQL is fetching data from disk rather than using indexes efficiently. Creating an index may significantly improve query performance.\n\nLet’s use a particle example to bring this home. Suppose you run a daily report listing all customers who made a purchase in the last 24 hours. Over time, as the number of customers and purchases grows, you notice that the query is taking longer and longer to run. To diagnose the issue, you turn to :\n\nWithin your use case, the high value suggests that PostgreSQL is fetching a substantial amount of data directly from the disk when executing this query. Furthermore, the of 300 milliseconds indicates a significant delay in retrieving this data, which should be performing much better. (Once again, don’t take these values as generally applicable—you’ll have to determine your own normal ranges by monitoring overtime.)\n\nGiven this insight, you decide to investigate the indexes on the purchases table. You discover that there's no index on the column. By adding an appropriate index, you might be able to significantly reduce the and , leading to a faster query execution:\n\nAfter creating the index and letting it populate, you could revisit to confirm the improvement.\n\nUsing EXPLAIN ANALYZE and looking for Seq Scan\n\nWe’re mentioning a lot in this series, and for a good reason—it’s a fantastic tool. By running before executing a query, you can examine the query execution plan generated by the planner. It details which indexes are being used, how data is retrieved, and which query node might be spending excessive time.\n\nFor the specific case of optimizing indexes, if you see that PostgreSQL is doing sequential scans (Seq Scan) on large tables when you expect it to be doing index scans, this is another sign that the system isn't using indexes.\n\nImagine a table with a column containing a million records. You frequently run queries to look up customers by their email addresses, so you've set up an index on the column to optimize these lookups. However, over time, you've noticed that the query performance seems to be deteriorating. To investigate this, you decide to examine the query plan using :\n\nYou get this output:\n\nThe output shows that PostgreSQL has chosen a over the table, even though there's an index on the column. This choice is surprising; you'd expect an index scan to be more efficient for such a specific lookup.\n\nThe output also gives you the time taken ( ) and highlights that the filter removed nearly all rows in the table ( ), indicating that there was indeed a full scan.\n\nThis information tells you that the index on the column can be more effective. Potential reasons might include:\n• None There's some misconfiguration that makes the planner believe sequential scans are cheaper. The parameters we’ve covered earlier, such as and , may not be set accurately according to your resources. As we’ve mentioned earlier, a common reason is that is too high, which causes the planner to avoid index scans even when they would be faster.\n• None The index is damaged or missing. This is a rare scenario, but indexes might get corrupted due to disk issues, crashes, or other issues. Furthermore, if an expected index has been inadvertently dropped or never created in the first place, PostgreSQL would have no choice but to revert to a sequential scan.\n• None The statistics used by the query planner are out of date. PostgreSQL relies on statistics about the distribution of data in tables and indexes to generate efficient query plans. As data changes over time (due to additions, updates, or deletions), these statistics can become outdated. Without accurate statistics, the query planner might make suboptimal choices, such as selecting a sequential scan over an index scan. Running the command helps the system gather fresh statistics.\n\nRoutine maintenance tasks, like and , play a crucial role in optimizing indexes in a PostgreSQL database, so with best practices, you can get serious results. The operation deserves special attention. When you run , the system examines the tables and updates the statistics related to the distribution of values within the tables\n\nThese statistics are vital because the query planner relies on them to devise the most efficient strategy to execute a query, which often includes deciding whether to use an index. Without updated statistics, the planner might make suboptimal choices, as mentioned previously.\n\nImplementing a regular routine for these maintenance tasks (e.g., weekly) can be highly beneficial. Such a schedule ensures that the database is rid of dead rows—obsolete data no longer accessible due to updates or deletions—and has up-to-date statistics.\n\nThere are some best practices to keep in mind to optimize your PostgreSQL database indexes. Most are related to server parameters.\n\nCertain server parameters offer a degree of control over how the query planner makes decisions about index usage, and they are instrumental in optimizing query performance. Let’s cover the best practices for these parameters:\n\nWe discussed these parameters in the previous episode of this series . dictates the amount of memory allocated to each database operation, such as sorting and hashing—its sizing directly impacts whether operations remain in memory or spill over to disk. If is set appropriately, it can efficiently accommodate bitmap scans and sorts in memory, reducing the need for PostgreSQL to rely heavily on indexes. If the allocated memory is too small, the system might have to use disk-based temporary storage, affecting performance.\n\nrepresents a cache of the database's disk pages in the main memory and is critical in how frequently the database needs to access the underlying disk. A well-sized ensures that frequently accessed table and index pages are kept in fast, main memory, drastically reducing I/O operations and improving overall query response times.\n\nMake sure to check out Part II for more detailed configuration recommendations for both these parameters.\n\nprovides the query planner with an estimate of how much memory is available for caching data and indexes. Although it doesn't allocate memory by itself, it influences the planner's decisions regarding the execution of queries.\n\nThis parameter is essential for query planning, as it guides the planner in selecting the most efficient query plan based on the expected cost of different strategies. For example, suppose the is a high value and the planner believes, based on this setting, that much of the needed data is likely to be in the OS's cache. In that case, the query planner is more likely to favor index scans over sequential ones, assuming ample caching memory.\n\nThe optimal value will vary based on your setup, but a common starting point is setting it to 50-70 percent of your machine's total RAM.\n\nand are configuration parameters that help the PostgreSQL query planner estimate the relative costs of random versus sequential page reads. By default, is set to 1 (one), indicating the base cost of a sequential read, while is set to 4 (four), suggesting that random access is considered four times more expensive than sequential access.\n\nGenerally, index lookups tend to involve random disk I/O because of the nature of traversing index trees. Full table scans are more inclined to be sequential, although this can vary with frequent updates or deletions. Adjusting the downward makes the planner more favorable towards index scans by narrowing the perceived cost gap between random and sequential page reads.\n\nIt's worth noting that the default value of 4 is more aligned with the behavior of traditional spinning disks. However, if your PostgreSQL instance runs on an SSD, you could see benefits by adjusting to around 1.1, reflecting the significantly reduced random access penalty of SSDs.\n\nThis parameter indicates the relative cost of CPU operations required to scan and process index entries during query execution.\n\nIn theory, adjusting allows you to influence the query planner's choices regarding whether to utilize an index or a sequential scan for a particular query. Lower values would make index scans more appealing from a cost perspective, while higher values would lead the planner to favor sequential scans.\n\nIn practice, it is not recommended to alter the default value for , which is 0.005 in the latest versions of PostgreSQL—at least not without thorough testing. The potential performance gains from tweaking it are usually marginal compared to the risks, e.g., suboptimal query plans and unexpected performance regressions.\n\nOnly index what you need\n\nDon't create indexes on every column. Assess your query patterns and create indexes that align with your most common queries. Over-indexing can negatively impact write operations, increase storage requirements, and introduce maintenance overhead.\n\nIndexing uniformly distributed columns with few distinct values (say gender or a boolean value) is usually an anti-pattern, as the random I/O generated by using the index will still visit most pages and will be slower than sequentially scanning the table. Sometimes, using partial indexes (which have a clause), multicolumn indexes, or writing queries with char can solve this problem.\n\nAs your application's data and usage patterns evolve, the effectiveness of existing indexes may diminish. Regular reviews and optimizations can help align indexes with current query requirements.\n\nBefore implementing new indexes, assess their impact on query performance using tools like to verify whether the planner utilizes the index.\n\nAfter adding or removing an index, update statistics using the command on the affected table. Accurate statistics about the distribution of values in indexed columns are vital for the query optimizer to make better decisions. Failing to update statistics can result in suboptimal query plans and decreased performance.\n\nThe standard command requires an exclusive table lock, which can disrupt database operations. In contrast, allows the table to remain accessible during the index rebuilding process, although it may take longer to complete. Setting a higher value of can substantially speed up the index creation process, as we mentioned in\n\nAs part of our approach to PostgreSQL performance tuning, we want to abstract much of this work, handling it automatically for the user so they can focus on building their application—not their database. That's what we do with hypertables and automatic indexing.\n\nWhen working with partitioned tables or with Timescale’s hypertables (which abstract partitioning, taking care of it automatically), it’s worth noting:\n• None In PostgreSQL, while you can create indexes on the parent partitioned table (which apply to all partitions), you can also create indexes on individual partitions, known as local indexes. If you’re using in Timescale, an index will be created on each chunk (instead of a single transaction for the entire hypertable), enhancing performance for large databases.\n• None When creating a hypertable, Timescale automatically creates indexes on the time column.\n\nYou can inspect your database indexes via the Explorer view in the Timescale console\n• None You can also use composite indexes (an index that includes two or more table columns) in vanilla PostgreSQL and hypertables. These indexes are useful if your queries often filter on the time column combined with one or more other columns. For example, you may want to keep the index on time to quickly filter for a given time range and add another index on another column (e.g., ).\n• None When building composite indexes, order matters. Check out this blog post for more information.\n• None To define an index as a or index in Timescale, the index must include the time and the partitioning columns (if you use one).\n• None When you create a hypertable in Timescale, set the datatype for the time column as and not .\n• None In partitioned tables, it is extra important to pay attention to over-indexing, as every index you add introduces extra overhead during data ingestion.\n• None If you have sparse data (a.k.a. with columns that are often ), you can add a clause to the index saying column . This clause prevents the index from indexing data, which can lead to a more compact and efficient index.\n• None One of the benefits of partitioned tables is the ability to quickly drop partitions (for example, old data in a time-based partitioning setup). When a partition is dropped, its associated indexes are also dropped, which is much faster than deleting rows and cleaning up associated index entries. This operation is even faster in Timescale due to its data retention policies and continuous aggregates .\n• None Indexing strategies should consider how data in partitioned tables is accessed. For example, if older partitions (e.g., in a time-based partitioning setup) are rarely accessed, it might not be worth maintaining certain indexes.\n\nWhen transforming your PostgreSQL tables into hypertables, you’ll keep your indexes , as seen in this blog post.\n\nAn efficient PostgreSQL indexing is a potent ally for fine-tuning data retrieval within your applications. Indexing is a balancing act, but creating the appropriate indexes and maintaining them will significantly enhance the overall performance of your PostgreSQL database.\n\nOn to the last article of this series: PostgreSQL Performance Tuning: Designing and Implementing Your Database Schema ."

You frequently need to find orders based on two things: the customer's ID and the order date. Here's how the table looks:\n\nTo make these order-based queries faster, we can create a multi-column index on both and . It's like giving your database a roadmap for finding orders efficiently:\n\nNow, your queries involving filtering by both criteria will be optimized for speed.\n\nImagine managing a table with detailed information about various products. You frequently search for products based on their category and manufacturer. To create a covering index, including the column in the index might enhance performance.\n\nCreate an index with columns ordered by and , and include the :\n\nConsider a scenario where you manage a database of products. The table includes several columns: , , , , and . You frequently run queries to filter products based on their and .\n\nWhen creating a multi-column index, the order of the columns is crucial. The leftmost column in the index plays a pivotal role. It should align with the most frequently filtered or sorted criteria in your queries.\n\nIn our case, since we often filter by first and then by , the optimal index order should have as the leftmost column.\n\nNow, when you run queries filtering by and , the index's hierarchy aligns perfectly with your query patterns, leading to efficient data retrieval.\n\nConversely, if you create the index with an incorrect order, say, starting with , it might not yield the same performance benefits:\n\nQueries filtering by first would not benefit from this index as much, as it doesn't match the leftmost prefix of the index.\n\nNow, let’s see how this well-ordered index improves query performance:\n\nThis query efficiently utilizes the multi-column index, benefiting from the leftmost column.\n\nContrast this with a query that doesn’t align with the index order:\n\nThis query might not fully leverage the index’s potential, resulting in potentially slower performance.\n\nWhen to Avoid Indexing: Situations to Consider\n• Highly Volatile Tables: Tables frequently changing with new data or updates may not benefit from indexes due to potential write performance impacts.\n• Small Tables: For very small tables with few rows, adding indexes may not significantly boost performance and could be unnecessary.\n• Low Selectivity Columns: Columns with limited distinct values might not gain much from indexing; focus on columns with higher variety.\n• Frequent Full Table Scans: When queries scan the entire table without leveraging indexes, the overhead of maintaining them may not be justified.\n• Batch Insert Operations: During large data imports, temporarily removing and then rebuilding indexes can expedite the process.\n• Temporary Tables: For short-lived tables rarely queried, adding indexes might not be worth the effort.\n• Queries with Low Complexity: Simple queries with minimal filtering may not see significant performance gains from indexes.\n• Low Latency Tolerance: In real-time applications, even minor indexing delays may not be acceptable, necessitating other optimization methods.\n\nKeep in mind that whether to use or skip indexes should be based on a thorough analysis of your specific database and your performance needs. It can be beneficial to closely examine your queries, both with and without indexes, and employ the command to determine the actual impact on performance.\n\nBecoming professional in indexing is a must skill when working with the PostgreSQL database management system. By knowing which columns to index and understanding how indexing really works, you’ll have the tools to make your queries faster and more efficient. Don’t hesitate to experiment with various types of indexes, monitor their performance, and leverage included columns to create efficient covering indexes. Armed with these practical examples, you’ll be well-prepared to enhance the efficiency of your PostgreSQL database, ensuring that your application remains responsive and fast, even as your data continues to evolve and expand."
