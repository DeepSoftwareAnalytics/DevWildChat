        "document": "Although Python 3 has officially started to use UTF-8 encoding for text files, I still sometimes got errors regarding ASCII/UTF-8 in Docker container. Surprisingly, there is no such issue in the native system. It turns out that it is the system locale problem. In the native system, the locale is usually properly set from the GUI during installation. In Docker container, usually the system locale was not set, and therefore UTF-8 could not be properly read and display in the terminal.\n\nIn this blog post, I will talk about how to set the locale properly in Docker container so that there will be no UTF-8 problems at all.\n\nWe could check the system locale using the command.\n\nIf the , , and are not set with locales, you are likely to have UTF-8 read and display issues when running computer programs.\n\nIn Python, we could also check the encoding method of the locale in the system using the following command.\n\nIf the output is not , you are likely to have UTF-8 read and display issues when running computer programs.\n\nIt should be noted that the following command, although somewhat similar to the one we used above, does not reflect the system locale.\n\nIt is actually simple to set locale for the Docker container. During the building of Docker image, just add either one of the following Docker script snippets to the Dockerfile and you are all set."

        "document": "To navigate to Settings either:\n• Select the Docker menu and then Settings\n• Select the Settings icon from the Docker Desktop Dashboard.\n\nYou can also locate the file (or for Docker Desktop versions 4.34 and earlier) at:\n\nOn the General tab, you can configure when to start Docker and specify other settings:\n• None Start Docker Desktop when you sign in to your computer. Select to automatically start Docker Desktop when you sign in to your machine.\n• None Open Docker Dashboard when Docker Desktop starts. Select to automatically open the dashboard when starting Docker Desktop.\n• None Choose theme for Docker Desktop. Choose whether you want to apply a Light or Dark theme to Docker Desktop. Alternatively you can set Docker Desktop to Use system settings.\n• None Choose container terminal. Determines which terminal is launched when opening the terminal from a container. If you choose the integrated terminal, you can run commands in a running container straight from the Docker Desktop Dashboard. For more information, see Explore containers.\n• None Enable Docker terminal. Interact with your host machine and execute commands directly from Docker Desktop.\n• None Enable Docker Debug by default. Check this option to use Docker Debug by default when accessing the integrated terminal. For more information, see Explore containers.\n• None Mac only Include VM in Time Machine backups. Select to back up the Docker Desktop virtual machine. This option is turned off by default.\n• None Windows only Expose daemon on tcp://localhost:2375 without TLS. Check this option to enable legacy clients to connect to the Docker daemon. You must use this option with caution as exposing the daemon without TLS can result in remote code execution attacks.\n• None Windows only Use the WSL 2 based engine. WSL 2 provides better performance than the Hyper-V backend. For more information, see Docker Desktop WSL 2 backend.\n• None Windows only Add the names to the host's file (Password required). Lets you resolve DNS names from both the host and your containers.\n• None Use containerd for pulling and storing images. Turns on the containerd image store. This brings new features like faster container startup performance by lazy-pulling images, and the ability to run Wasm applications with Docker. For more information, see containerd image store.\n• None Mac only Choose Virtual Machine Manager (VMM). Choose the Virtual Machine Manager for creating and managing the Docker Desktop Linux VM.\n• Select Docker VMM for the latest and most performant Hypervisor/Virtual Machine Manager. This option is available only on Apple Silicon Macs running macOS 12.5 or later and is currently in Beta. Turn this setting on to make Docker Desktop run faster.\n• Alternatively, you can choose Apple Virtualization framework, QEMU (for Apple Silicon), or HyperKit (for Intel Macs). For macOS 12.5 and later, Apple Virtualization framework is the default setting. For more information, see Virtual Machine Manager.\n• None Mac only Choose file sharing implementation for your containers. Choose whether you want to share files using VirtioFS, gRPC FUSE, or osxfs (Legacy). VirtioFS is only available for macOS 12.5 and later, and is turned on by default. Use VirtioFS for speedy file sharing. VirtioFS has reduced the time taken to complete filesystem operations by up to 98% . It is the only file sharing implementation supported by Docker VMM.\n• None Mac only Use Rosetta for x86_64/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon. Turns on Rosetta to accelerate x86/AMD64 binary emulation on Apple Silicon. This option is only available if you have selected Apple Virtualization framework as the Virtual Machine Manager. You must also be on macOS 13 or later.\n• None Send usage statistics. Select so Docker Desktop sends diagnostics, crash reports, and usage data. This information helps Docker improve and troubleshoot the application. Clear the checkbox to opt out. Docker may periodically prompt you for more information.\n• None Use Enhanced Container Isolation. Select to enhance security by preventing containers from breaching the Linux VM. For more information, see Enhanced Container Isolation. This setting is only available if you are signed in to Docker Desktop and have a Docker Business subscription.\n• None Show CLI hints. Displays CLI hints and tips when running Docker commands in the CLI. This is turned on by default. To turn CLI hints on or off from the CLI, set to or respectively.\n• None SBOM Indexing. When this option is enabled, inspecting an image in Docker Desktop shows a Start analysis button that, when selected, analyzes the image with Docker Scout.\n• None Enable background SBOM indexing. When this option is enabled, Docker Scout automatically analyzes images that you build or pull.\n• None Mac only Automatically check configuration. Regularly checks your configuration to ensure no unexpected changes have been made by another application. Docker Desktop checks if your setup, configured during installation, has been altered by external apps like Orbstack. Docker Desktop checks:\n• The symlinks of Docker binaries to .\n• The symlink of the default Docker socket. Additionally, Docker Desktop ensures that the context is switched to on startup. You are notified if changes are found and are able to restore the configuration directly from the notification. For more information, see the FAQs.\n\nThe Resources tab allows you to configure CPU, memory, disk, proxies, network, and other resources.\n\nOn the Advanced tab, you can limit resources available to the Docker Linux VM.\n• None CPU limit. Specify the maximum number of CPUs to be used by Docker Desktop. By default, Docker Desktop is set to use all the processors available on the host machine.\n• None Memory limit. By default, Docker Desktop is set to use up to 50% of your host's memory. To increase the RAM, set this to a higher number; to decrease it, lower the number.\n• None Swap. Configure swap file size as needed. The default is 1 GB.\n• None Virtual disk limit. Specify the maximum size of the disk image.\n• None Disk image location. Specify the location of the Linux volume where containers and images are stored. You can also move the disk image to a different location. If you attempt to move a disk image to a location that already has one, you are asked if you want to use the existing image or replace it.\n• None Resource Saver. Enable or disable Resource Saver mode, which significantly reduces CPU and memory utilization on the host by automatically turning off the Linux VM when Docker Desktop is idle (i.e., no containers are running). You can also configure the Resource Saver timeout which indicates how long should Docker Desktop be idle before Resource Saver mode kicks in. Default is 5 minutes. Exit from Resource Saver mode occurs automatically when containers run. Exit may take a few seconds (~3 to 10 secs) as Docker Desktop restarts the Linux VM.\n\nUse File sharing to allow local directories on your machine to be shared with Linux containers. This is especially useful for editing source code in an IDE on the host while running and testing the code in a container.\n\nSynchronized file shares is an alternative file sharing mechanism that provides fast and flexible host-to-VM file sharing, enhancing bind mount performance through the use of synchronized filesystem caches. Available with Pro, Team, and Business subscriptions.\n\nTo learn more, see Synchronized file share.\n\nBy default the , , , and directory are shared. If your project is outside this directory then it must be added to the list, otherwise you may get or errors at runtime.\n• None Add a Directory. Select and navigate to the directory you want to add.\n• None Remove a Directory. Select next to the directory you want to remove\n• None Apply & Restart makes the directory available to containers using Docker's bind mount ( ) feature.\n\nOn Windows, you can share a folder \"on demand\" the first time a particular folder is used by a container.\n\nIf you run a Docker command from a shell with a volume mount (as shown in the example below) or kick off a Compose file that includes volume mounts, you get a popup asking if you want to share the specified folder.\n\nYou can select to Share it, in which case it is added to your Docker Desktop Shared Folders list and available to containers. Alternatively, you can opt not to share it by selecting Cancel.\n\nDocker Desktop supports the use of HTTP/HTTPS and SOCKS5 proxies.\n\nHTTP/HTTPS proxies can be used when:\n\nIf the host uses a HTTP/HTTPS proxy configuration (static or via Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC)), Docker Desktop reads this configuration and automatically uses these settings for signing in to Docker, for pulling and pushing images, and for container Internet access. If the proxy requires authorization then Docker Desktop dynamically asks the developer for a username and password. All passwords are stored securely in the OS credential store. Note that only the proxy authentication method is supported so we recommend using an URL for your HTTP/HTTPS proxies to protect passwords while in transit on the network. Docker Desktop supports TLS 1.3 when communicating with proxies.\n\nTo set a different proxy for Docker Desktop, turn on Manual proxy configuration and enter a single upstream proxy URL of the form or .\n\nTo prevent developers from accidentally changing the proxy settings, see Settings Management.\n\nThe HTTPS proxy settings used for scanning images are set using the environment variable.\n\nIf your proxy uses Basic authentication, Docker Desktop prompts developers for a username and password and caches the credentials. All passwords are stored securely in the OS credential store. It will request re-authentication if that cache is removed.\n\nIt's recommended that you use an URL for HTTP/HTTPS proxies to protect passwords during network transit. Docker Desktop also supports TLS 1.3 for communication with proxies.\n\nDevelopers are no longer interrupted by prompts for proxy credentials as authentication is centralized. This also reduces the risk of account lockouts due to incorrect sign in attempts.\n\nIf your proxy offers multiple authentication schemes in 407 (Proxy Authentication Required) response, Docker Desktop by default selects the Basic authentication scheme.\n\nTo enable Kerberos or NTLM proxy authentication, no additional configuration is needed beyond specifying the proxy IP address and port.\n\nFor Docker Desktop version 4.32 and later:\n\nTo enable Kerberos or NTLM proxy authentication you must pass the installer flag during installation via the command line, and ensure your proxy server is properly configured for Kerberos or NTLM authentication.\n\nDocker Desktop uses a private IPv4 network for internal services such as a DNS server and an HTTP proxy. In case Docker Desktop's choice of subnet clashes with IPs in your environment, you can specify a custom subnet using the Network setting.\n\nOn Mac, you can also select the Use kernel networking for UDP setting. This lets you use a more efficient kernel networking path for UDP. This may not be compatible with your VPN software.\n\nOn Windows in WSL 2 mode, you can configure which WSL 2 distributions will have the Docker WSL integration.\n\nBy default, the integration is enabled on your default WSL distribution. To change your default WSL distribution, run . (For example, to set Ubuntu as your default WSL distribution, run ).\n\nYou can also select any additional distributions you would like to enable the WSL 2 integration on.\n\nFor more details on configuring Docker Desktop to use WSL 2, see Docker Desktop WSL 2 backend.\n\nThe Docker Engine tab allows you to configure the Docker daemon used to run containers with Docker Desktop.\n\nYou configure the daemon using a JSON configuration file. Here's what the file might look like:\n\nYou can find this file at . To change the configuration, either edit the JSON configuration directly from the dashboard in Docker Desktop, or open and edit the file using your favorite text editor.\n\nTo see the full list of possible configuration options, see the dockerd command reference.\n\nSelect Apply & Restart to save your settings and restart Docker Desktop.\n\nIf you have turned on the Docker Desktop Builds view, you can use the Builders tab to inspect and manage builders in the Docker Desktop settings.\n\nTo inspect builders, find the builder that you want to inspect and select the expand icon. You can only inspect active builders.\n\nThe Selected builder section displays the selected builder. To select a different builder:\n• Find the builder that you want to use under Available builders\n• Open the drop-down menu next to the builder's name.\n• Select Use to switch to this builder.\n\nYour build commands now use the selected builder by default.\n\nTo create a builder, use the Docker CLI. See Create a new builder\n\nYou can remove a builder if:\n• None The builder isn't associated with a Docker context. To remove builders associated with a Docker context, remove the context using the command.\n• Find the builder that you want to remove under Available builders\n\nIf the builder uses the or driver, the build cache is also removed, along with the builder.\n\nBuilders that use the driver run the BuildKit daemon in a container. You can start and stop the BuildKit container using the drop-down menu.\n\nRunning a build automatically starts the container if it's stopped.\n\nYou can only start and stop builders using the driver.\n\nDocker Desktop includes a standalone Kubernetes server, so that you can test deploying your Docker workloads on Kubernetes. To turn on Kubernetes support and install a standalone instance of Kubernetes running as a Docker container, select Enable Kubernetes.\n\nWith Docker Desktop version 4.38 and later, you can choose your cluster provisioning method:\n• Kubeadm creates a single-node cluster and the version is set by Docker Desktop.\n• kind creates a multi-node cluster and you can set the version and number of nodes.\n\nDocker Desktop version 4.38 and later also lets you install the Kubernetes Dashboard within an existing Kubernetes cluster with the Deploy the Kubernetes Dashboard into cluster setting. It provides real-time visibility into workloads and nodes and helps you manage and monitor your Kubernetes clusters and applications easily.\n\nSelect Show system containers (advanced) to view internal containers when using Docker commands.\n\nSelect Reset Kubernetes cluster to delete all stacks and Kubernetes resources.\n\nFor more information about using the Kubernetes integration with Docker Desktop, see Deploy on Kubernetes.\n\nThe Software Updates tab notifies you of any updates available to Docker Desktop. When there's a new update, you can choose to download the update right away, or select the Release Notes option to learn what's included in the updated version.\n\nTurn off the check for updates by clearing the Automatically check for updates check box. This disables notifications in the Docker menu and the notification badge that appears on the Docker Desktop Dashboard. To check for updates manually, select the Check for updates option in the Docker menu.\n\nTo allow Docker Desktop to automatically download new updates in the background, select Always download updates. This downloads newer versions of Docker Desktop when an update becomes available. After downloading the update, select Apply and Restart to install the update. You can do this either through the Docker menu or in the Updates section in the Docker Desktop Dashboard.\n\nUse the Extensions tab to:\n• Allow only extensions distributed through the Docker Marketplace\n\nFor more information about Docker extensions, see Extensions.\n\nOn the Feature control tab you can control your settings for Beta features and Experimental features.\n\nYou can also sign up to the Developer Preview program from the Features in development tab.\n\nBeta features provide access to future product functionality. These features are intended for testing and feedback only as they may change between releases without warning or remove them entirely from a future release. Beta features must not be used in production environments. Docker doesn't offer support for beta features.\n\nExperimental features provide early access to future product functionality. These features are intended for testing and feedback only as they may change between releases without warning or can be removed entirely from a future release. Experimental features must not be used in production environments. Docker does not offer support for experimental features.\n\nFor a list of current experimental features in the Docker CLI, see Docker CLI Experimental features .\n\nUse the Notifications tab to turn on or turn off notifications for the following events:\n\nBy default, all notifications are turned on. You'll always receive error notifications and notifications about new Docker Desktop releases and updates.\n\nNotifications momentarily appear in the lower-right of the Docker Desktop Dashboard and then move to the Notifications drawer. To open the Notifications drawer, select .\n\nOn Mac, you can reconfigure your initial installation settings on the Advanced tab:\n• None Choose how to configure the installation of Docker's CLI tools.\n• System: Docker CLI tools are installed in the system directory under\n• User: Docker CLI tools are installed in the user directory under . You must then add to your PATH. To add to your path:\n• Open your shell configuration file. This is if you're using a bash shell, or if you're using a zsh shell.\n• Copy and paste the following:\n• Save and the close the file. Restart your shell to apply the changes to the PATH variable.\n• None Enable default Docker socket (Requires password). Creates which some third party clients may use to communicate with Docker Desktop. For more information, see permission requirements for macOS.\n• None Enable privileged port mapping (Requires password). Starts the privileged helper process which binds the ports that are between 1 and 1024. For more information, see permission requirements for macOS. For more information on each configuration and use case, see Permission requirements."
