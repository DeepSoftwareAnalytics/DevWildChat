        "document": "When we try to number rows in Excel using the Fill Series handle, Excel doesn’t understand why we are filling it down. It assumes we wish to copy the value from the first cell.\n\nThere are ways to get the sequential list we had hoped for by either supplying a number pattern (like 1 & 2) or clicking on the Fill Options button to change the behavior from Copy Cells to Fill Series.\n\nThe problem with these methods is that anything beyond a list of 20 to 30 numbers becomes a frustrating exercise. Imagine trying to build a list of 1 million numbers. The time it would take to scroll down 1 million rows is a dealbreaker.\n\nAnother problem is that when new items are added to the list, the numbers do not automatically increase to account for the new items.\n\nThe biggest problem with numbering lists this way is that adding or removing an item can mess up the order. Sorting the list by a different column also scrambles the numbers.\n\nUse the Excel SEQUENCE Function to Generate Numbered Lists\n\nThe SEQUENCE function is the perfect tool to number rows in Excel of any length quickly. It ensures the list remains correct even when rows are added, deleted, or sorted.\n\nThe simplest use of the SEQUENCE function is to give it a value that represents the count of numbers needed. A list of numbers that goes from 1 to 10 in whole number increments would look like the following:\n\nAlthough easy, it doesn’t tell us where the adjacent list ends or extend when new list items are added.\n\nA smarter way to do this is to have the SEQUENCE function count the number of items in the adjacent list. Then, use that count as the “count of numbers to generate” argument.\n\nIt doesn’t matter if the list grows, shrinks, or is sorted, the number sequence remains correct.\n\nIf you like your numbered lists fancier, the way to achieve it is to concatenate text before or after the generated numbers. Here’s a couple of examples:\n\nIf you don’t want to change your formulas to include the extra text, you can use Custom Number Formatting to alter the appearance of the SEQUENCE results.\n\nSelect the cells (or the entire column) containing SEQUENCE numbers, then press CTRL + 1 to open the Format Cells dialog box.\n\nOn the Number tab, select the “Custom” category and enter something like the following examples.\n\nIf you are a fan of Excel Tables (and who isn’t?), you’ll be disappointed to learn that you can’t use the SEQUENCE function because you’ll encounter a #SPILL! error.\n\nAn alternate method of creating dynamic numbered lists in an Excel Table is to use the ROW function.\n\nThe ROW function returns the row number in which the function resides. If the function is used on row 3, the number 3 is returned.\n\nBelow is an example of using the ROW function in a table. Note the “minus one” to account for the table’s heading.\n\nImagine you need a list where each number repeats several times before moving to the next number. For example, the list would look like: 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, and so on.\n\nHere’s a simple way to do this:\n• Count the Items: First, find out how many numbers you need in total. Use the COUNTA function, which counts how many items are in a column.\n• Generate the Numbers: Next, use the SEQUENCE function. This function creates a list of numbers. Set it to start at 3 and increase each number by 1.\n• Round Down: Lastly, the INT function helps by rounding down any decimal numbers. It takes the list from SEQUENCE, divides each number by 3, and keeps only the whole number part. This ensures each number repeats three times.\n\nThe formula to use in your spreadsheet is:\n\nThis makes each number repeat three times before the next increment. I demonstrate this method in this video.\n\nEnhance your learning experience by downloading our workbook.

Adding them manually can take time and result in errors, but there are several ways you can add these numbers automatically.\n\nSave yourself some time at work by learning how to add serial numbers to your spreadsheets. We’ll cover four popular methods.\n\nIf you want to add a series of number rows without doing so manually, use the Fill Series tool to generate a column with a list of numbers in it.\n• Select the cell you want to use and insert the number “1” into it\n• Click the Home tab, then hover over to Editing, then Fill, then Series.\n• The Series window will populate, and when it does, key in the following information:\n• Stop Value = the number you want to end your sequence with (ex: 1,000)\n\nFor this method, click on the cell A1, then edit it. Key in the =ROW() formula. You’ll then select the formula and drag it to the number you want to end your sequence with.\n\nThis is another quick method to use if you want to add serial numbers in an Excel spreadsheet.\n• Click the cell you want to use to start your sequence\n• Enter the number “1” into the cell\n• In the next cell down, key in the formula =C1+1 (assuming C1 is your starting cell)\n• Click the formula and then drag it down to the number you want to end your sequence with\n\nIf you want to add serial numbers to a pivot table, it’s important to insert an extra column in your source data. This number column will appear after the row item columns.\n\nTo accomplish this task, follow these steps:\n• Add a new column in your source data, and place a “1” in each cell\n• Create a pivot table with the data therein\n• Right-click the column in the values section and select Value Field Settings\n• Click on Show Value As and select the running total\n\nWe hope these tools help save time and enhance the quality of your data!\n\nIf you want to take your Excel skills to the next level and explore a wide range of formulas and functions, check out our workshop.\n\nAnd, we’ve got you covered with an entire library of solutions that will empower you to work smarter!\n\nLike Learn Excel Now?

        "document": "In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a number sequence in Excel with formulas. Additionally, we'll show you how to auto generate a series of Roman numbers and random integers - all by using a new dynamic array SEQUENCE function.\n\nThe times when you had to put numbers in sequence in Excel manually are long gone. In modern Excel, you can make a simple number series in a flash with the Auto Fill feature. If you have a more specific task in mind, then use the SEQUENCE function, which is specially designed for this purpose.\n\nThe SEQUENCE function in Excel is used to generate an array of sequential numbers such as 1, 2, 3, etc. It is a new dynamic array function introduced in Microsoft Excel 365. The result is a dynamic array that spills into the specified number of rows and columns automatically. The function has the following syntax: Rows (optional) - the number of rows to fill. Columns (optional) - the number of columns to fill. If omitted, defaults to 1 column. Start (optional) - the starting number in the sequence. If omitted, defaults to 1. Step (optional) - the increment for each subsequent value in the sequence. It can be positive or negative.\n• If omitted, the step defaults to 1. The SEQUENCE function is only supported in Excel for Microsoft 365, Excel 2021, and Excel for the web.\n\n\n\nIf you are looking to populate a column of rows with sequential numbers starting at 1, you can use the Excel SEQUENCE function in its simplest form: Where n is the number of elements in the sequence. For example, to populate a column with 10 incremental numbers, type the below formula in the first cell (A2 in our case) and press the Enter key: The results will spill in the other rows automatically.\n\n To make a horizontal sequence, set the rows argument to 1 (or omit it) and define the number of columns, 8 in our case: If you'd like to fill a range of cells with sequential numbers, then define both the rows and columns arguments. For instance, to populate 5 rows and 3 columns, you'd use this formula: To start with a specific number, say 100, supply that number in the 3rd argument: To generate a list of numbers with a specific increment step, define the step in the 4th argument, 10 in our case: Translated into plain English, our complete formula reads as follows:\n\n To efficiently do a sequence of numbers in Excel, please remember these 4 simple facts:\n• The SEQUENCE function is only available with Microsoft 365 subscriptions and Excel 2021. In Excel 2019, Excel 2016 and earlier versions, it does not work since those versions do not support dynamic arrays.\n• If the array of sequential numbers is the final result, Excel outputs all the numbers automatically in a so-called spill range. So, be sure you have enough empty cells down and to the right of the cell where you enter the formula, otherwise a #SPILL error will occur.\n• The resulting array can be one-dimensional or two-dimensional, depending on how you configure the rows and columns arguments.\n• Any optional argument that is not set defaults to 1.\n\nHow to create a number sequence in Excel - formula examples Though the basic SEQUENCE formula does not look very exciting, when combined with other functions, it takes on a whole new level of usefulness. To generate a descending sequential series, such that each subsequent value is less than the preceding one, supply a negative number for the step argument. For example, to create a list of numbers starting at 10 and decreasing by 1, use this formula: When populating a range of cells with sequential numbers, by default, the series always goes horizontally across the first row and then down to the next row, just like reading a book from left to right. To get it to propagate vertically, i.e. top to bottom across the first column and then right to the next column, nest SEQUENCE in the TRANSPOSE function. Please note that TRANSPOSE swaps rows and columns, so you should specify them in the reverse order: For example, to fill 5 rows and 3 columns with sequential numbers starting at 100 and incremented by 10, the formula takes this form: To better understand the approach, please have a look at the screenshot below. Here, we input all the parameters in separate cells (E1:E4) and create 2 sequences with the below formulas. Please pay attention rows and columns are supplied in different order! Regular sequence that moves horizontally left to right (column-wise): Need a Roman number sequence for some task, or just for fun? That's easy! Build a regular SEQUENCE formula and warp it in the ROMAN function. For example: Where B1 is the number of rows, B2 is the number of columns, B3 is the start number and B4 is the step.\n\n \n\n Generate an increasing or decreasing sequence of random numbers As you probably know, in new Excel there is a special function for generating random numbers, RANDARRAY, which we discussed a few articles ago. This function can do a lot of useful things, but in our case it cannot help. To generate either an ascending or descending series of random whole numbers, we'll be needing the good old RANDBETWEEN function for the step argument of SEQUENCE. For example, to create a series of increasing random numbers that spills in as many rows and columns as specified in B1 and B2, respectively, and start at the integer in B3, the formula goes as follows: Depending on whether you want a smaller or bigger step, supply a lower or higher number for the second argument of RANDBETWEEN.\n\n To make a sequence of decreasing random numbers, the step should be negative, so you put the minus sign before the RANDBETWEEN function: Note. Because the Excel RANDBETWEEN function is volatile, it will generate new random values with every change in your worksheet. As the result, your sequence of random numbers will be continuously changing. To prevent this from happening, you can use Excel's Paste Special > Values feature to replace formulas with values.\n\nThat's how to create sequence in Excel with formulas. I hope the examples were both useful and fun. Anyway, thank you for reading and hope to see you on our blog next week!"

        "document": "Use COUNTIF, one of the statistical functions, to count the number of cells that meet a criterion; for example, to count the number of times a particular city appears in a customer list. In its simplest form, COUNTIF says:\n• =COUNTIF(Where do you want to look?, What do you want to look for?)\n\nThe group of cells you want to count. Range can contain numbers, arrays, a named range, or references that contain numbers. Blank and text values are ignored. Learn how to select ranges in a worksheet. A number, expression, cell reference, or text string that determines which cells will be counted. For example, you can use a number like 32, a comparison like \">32\", a cell like B4, or a word like \"apples\". COUNTIF uses only a single criteria. Use COUNTIFS if you want to use multiple criteria.\n\nTo use these examples in Excel, copy the data in the table below, and paste it in cell A1 of a new worksheet. Counts the number of cells with apples in cells A2 through A5. The result is 2. Counts the number of cells with peaches (the value in A4) in cells A2 through A5. The result is 1. Counts the number of apples (the value in A2), and oranges (the value in A3) in cells A2 through A5. The result is 3. This formula uses COUNTIF twice to specify multiple criteria, one criteria per expression. You could also use the COUNTIFS function. Counts the number of cells with a value greater than 55 in cells B2 through B5. The result is 2. Counts the number of cells with a value not equal to 75 in cells B2 through B5. The ampersand (&) merges the comparison operator for not equal to (<>) and the value in B4 to read =COUNTIF(B2:B5,\"<>75\"). The result is 3. Counts the number of cells with a value greater than (>) or equal to (=) 32 and less than (<) or equal to (=) 85 in cells B2 through B5. The result is 1. Counts the number of cells containing any text in cells A2 through A5. The asterisk (*) is used as the wildcard character to match any character. The result is 4. Counts the number of cells that have exactly 7 characters, and end with the letters \"es\" in cells A2 through A5. The question mark (?) is used as the wildcard character to match individual characters. The result is 2.\n\nBe aware that COUNTIF ignores upper and lower case in text strings. Criteria aren't case sensitive. In other words, the string \"apples\" and the string \"APPLES\" will match the same cells. Wildcard characters —the question mark (?) and asterisk (*)—can be used in criteria. A question mark matches any single character. An asterisk matches any sequence of characters. If you want to find an actual question mark or asterisk, type a tilde (~) in front of the character. For example, =COUNTIF(A2:A5,\"apple?\") will count all instances of \"apple\" with a last letter that could vary. Make sure your data doesn't contain erroneous characters. When counting text values, make sure the data doesn't contain leading spaces, trailing spaces, inconsistent use of straight and curly quotation marks, or nonprinting characters. In these cases, COUNTIF might return an unexpected value. Try using the CLEAN function or the TRIM function. COUNTIF supports named ranges in a formula (such as =COUNTIF(fruit,\">=32\")-COUNTIF(fruit,\">85\"). The named range can be in the current worksheet, another worksheet in the same workbook, or from a different workbook. To reference from another workbook, that second workbook also must be open."

It will calculate the number of cells that are not blank within a given set of values. The COUNTA function is also commonly referred to as the Excel COUNTIF Not Blank formula.\n\nAs a financial analyst, the COUNTA function is useful if we wish to keep a count of cells in a given range. Apart from crunching numbers, we often need to count cells with values. In such a scenario, the function can be useful.\n\nThe Excel countif not blank formula uses the following arguments:\n• Value1 (required argument) – This is the value at which we evaluate the function.\n• Value2 (optional argument) – Additional arguments that represent the values that we wish to count.\n\nA few notes about the arguments\n• We can enter up to 255 value arguments if we are using MS Excel 2007 or later. Earlier versions can handle 30 arguments only.\n• Value arguments can be values, an array of values, or references to cell ranges.\n\nHow to use the COUNTA Function in Excel?\n\nTo understand the uses of the COUNTA function, let’s consider a few examples:\n\nSuppose we are given the data below:\n\nAs seen above, the COUNTA function will count text or formula errors. So unlike the COUNT function, which considers only numbers, COUNTA considers numbers, dates, text values, logical values, and errors.\n\nWe get the results below:\n\nThe COUNTA function can be used for an array. If we enter the formula =COUNTA(B5:B10), we will get the result 6, as shown below:\n\nSuppose we wish to count the number of cells that contain data in a given set, as shown below:\n\nTo count the cells with data, we will use the formula =COUNTA(B4:B16).\n\nWe get 8 as the result, as the COUNTA function will not count cells that are absolutely empty cells.\n\nSuppose we wish to count cells that are not equal to a range of certain things. We can use a combination of the COUNTA, COUNTIF, and SUMPRODUCT functions to get the desired results.\n\nSuppose we are given the data below:\n\nTo count cells not equal to Rose and Marigold, we used the following formula:\n\nWe can list down the things we wish to exclude from counting. One other way to arrive at the same result is to use the formula =COUNTIFS(B4:B9,”<>Rose”B4:B9,”<>Marigold”).\n\nHowever, the above formula would be tedious to use if the list contains many items. We need to add an additional range/criteria pair for each item that we don’t wish to count.\n\nHence, we can use a reference list and use the =COUNTA(B4:B9)-SUMPRODUCT(COUNTIF(B4:B9,D5:D6)) formula.\n\nThe formula uses the range D5:D6 to hold values that we don’t want to count. The formula starts by counting all values in the range being counted with COUNTA. Next, it generates a count of all things we don’t want to count with COUNTIF. Lastly, SUMPRODUCT will sum up all items in the array, which returns 2. The number is then subtracted from the original total to yield the final result.\n\nWe get the result below:\n\nThings to remember about the COUNTA Function\n• If we wish to count logical values, we should use the COUNTA function, but if we want to count only cells that contain a number, we should use COUNT function.\n• The function belongs to the COUNT function family. There are five variants of COUNT functions: COUNT, COUNTA, COUNTBLANK, COUNTIF, and COUNTIFS.\n• We need to use the COUNTIF function or COUNTIFS function if we want to count only numbers that meet specific criteria.\n• If we wish to count based on certain criteria, we should use COUNTIF.\n\nClick here to download the sample Excel file\n\nThanks for reading CFI’s guide to important Excel functions!
