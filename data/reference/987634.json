        "document": "In today’s data-driven world, the ability to efficiently handle and analyze data in various formats is crucial for businesses to derive insights and make informed decisions. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) has emerged as one of the most popular formats for data interchange due to its simplicity and flexibility. Snowflake, a leading cloud data platform, offers robust capabilities for handling JSON data, enabling users to seamlessly ingest, store, and analyze JSON files. In this guide, we’ll explore how to read JSON files in Snowflake, empowering you to leverage the full potential of your data.\n\nBefore diving into reading JSON files in Snowflake, it’s essential to understand the structure of JSON data. JSON represents data in key-value pairs, making it easy to organize and store complex data structures. JSON objects are enclosed in curly braces , and each key is followed by a colon and its corresponding value. Arrays in JSON are enclosed in square brackets and can contain multiple objects or values.\n\nSnowflake provides several methods for ingesting JSON data into its platform:\n• Loading JSON Files from Cloud Storage: Snowflake seamlessly integrates with cloud storage services like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Microsoft Azure Blob Storage. You can simply load JSON files stored in these repositories into Snowflake using the COPY command.\n• Direct Ingestion from JSON Streams: Snowflake supports ingesting JSON data directly from streams, enabling real-time data ingestion and analysis. You can use Snowpipe, Snowflake’s continuous data ingestion service, to automatically load JSON data as it arrives.\n• Uploading JSON Files from Local Storage: If your JSON files are stored locally, you can easily upload them to Snowflake using the Snowflake web interface or SnowSQL, Snowflake’s command-line client.\n\nOnce the JSON data is ingested into Snowflake, you can leverage SQL queries to extract, transform, and analyze the data:\n\nIn the example above, we create an external stage pointing to the location of our JSON files and then define an external table to map the JSON data. We can then execute SQL queries to extract specific fields from the JSON data.\n\nHandling nested or complex JSON structures in Snowflake involves leveraging its semi-structured data capabilities along with SQL functions to navigate through the nested hierarchy. Let’s explore how to read nested JSON data with examples:\n\nConsider a nested JSON structure representing information about employees and their departments:\n\nTo read this nested JSON data in Snowflake, we’ll follow these steps:\n• Create Stage and External Table: Define a stage pointing to the location of the JSON files and create an external table to map the JSON data.\n• Query the Nested Data: Use Snowflake’s semi-structured data functions to query and extract information from the nested JSON structure.\n\nLet’s see how this is done with SQL queries:\n\nIn the above SQL query:\n• We use the function to flatten the nested arrays ( and ) and create a table-like structure.\n• We extract information such as company name, department details, and employee information using the column and accessing nested fields with the operator.\n\nThe output of this query will be a tabular result set containing all the extracted information from the nested JSON structure.\n\nBy utilizing Snowflake’s semi-structured data functions and SQL capabilities, you can effectively read and query nested JSON data, enabling you to gain valuable insights from complex data structures.\n\nBest Practices for Working with JSON Data in Snowflake\n\nTo maximize the efficiency and performance of working with JSON data in Snowflake, consider the following best practices:\n• Optimize Data Loading: Use Snowflake’s COPY command options to optimize data loading performance, such as specifying file formats and partitioning strategies.\n• Leverage Semi-Structured Data Functions: Snowflake provides powerful functions for querying semi-structured data, such as GET, ARRAY_CONTAINS, and FLATTEN, which simplify data extraction and manipulation.\n• Implement Data Compression: Utilize Snowflake’s automatic data compression feature to reduce storage costs and improve query performance, especially for large JSON datasets.\n• Monitor Query Performance: Regularly monitor query performance using Snowflake’s query history and performance metrics to identify and address any bottlenecks or inefficiencies.\n\nBy following these best practices, you can effectively read and analyze JSON data in Snowflake, unlocking valuable insights to drive business growth and innovation.\n\nIn conclusion, Snowflake provides robust capabilities for reading and analyzing JSON data, enabling organizations to harness the full potential of their data assets.

        "document": "Python’s module provides you with the tools you need to effectively handle JSON data. You can convert Python data types to a JSON-formatted string with or write them to files using . Similarly, you can read JSON data from files with and parse JSON strings with .\n\nJSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a widely-used text-based format for data interchange. Its syntax resembles Python dictionaries but with some differences, such as using only double quotes for strings and lowercase for Boolean values. With built-in tools for validating syntax and manipulating JSON files, Python makes it straightforward to work with JSON data.\n\nBy the end of this tutorial, you’ll understand that:\n• JSON in Python is handled using the standard-library module, which allows for data interchange between JSON and Python data types.\n• JSON is a good data format to use with Python as it’s human-readable and straightforward to serialize and deserialize, which makes it ideal for use in APIs and data storage.\n• You write JSON with Python using to serialize data to a file.\n• You can minify and prettify JSON using Python’s module.\n\nSince its introduction, JSON has rapidly emerged as the predominant standard for the exchange of information. Whether you want to transfer data with an API or store information in a document database, it’s likely you’ll encounter JSON. Fortunately, Python provides robust tools to facilitate this process and help you manage JSON data efficiently.\n\nWhile JSON is the most common format for data distribution, it’s not the only option for such tasks. Both XML and YAML serve similar purposes. If you’re interested in how the formats differ, then you can check out the tutorial on how to serialize your data with Python.\n\nThe acronym JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. As the name suggests, JSON originated from JavaScript. However, JSON has transcended its origins to become language-agnostic and is now recognized as the standard for data interchange. The popularity of JSON can be attributed to native support by the JavaScript language, resulting in excellent parsing performance in web browsers. On top of that, JSON’s straightforward syntax allows both humans and computers to read and write JSON data effortlessly. To get a first impression of JSON, have a look at this example code: You’ll learn more about the JSON syntax later in this tutorial. For now, recognize that the JSON format is text-based. In other words, you can create JSON files using the code editor of your choice. Once you set the file extension to , most code editors display your JSON data with syntax highlighting out of the box: The screenshot above shows how VS Code displays JSON data using the Bearded color theme. You’ll have a closer look at the syntax of the JSON format next! In the previous section, you got a first impression of how JSON data looks. And as a Python developer, the JSON structure probably reminds you of common Python data structures, like a dictionary that contains a string as a key and a value. If you understand the syntax of a dictionary in Python, you already know the general syntax of a JSON object. Note: Later in this tutorial, you’ll learn that you’re free to use lists and other data types at the top level of a JSON document. The similarity between Python dictionaries and JSON objects is no surprise. One idea behind establishing JSON as the go-to data interchange format was to make working with JSON as convenient as possible, independently of which programming language you use: [A collection of key-value pairs and arrays] are universal data structures. Virtually all modern programming languages support them in one form or another. It makes sense that a data format that is interchangeable with programming languages is also based on these structures. (Source) To explore the JSON syntax further, create a new file named and add a more complex JSON structure as the content of the file: In the code above, you see data about a dog named Frieda, which is formatted as JSON. The top-level value is a JSON object. Just like Python dictionaries, you wrap JSON objects inside curly braces ( ). In line 1, you start the JSON object with an opening curly brace ( ), and then you close the object at the end of line 20 with a closing curly brace ( ). Note: Although whitespace doesn’t matter in JSON, it’s customary for JSON documents to be formatted with two or four spaces to indicate indentation. If the file size of the JSON document is important, then you may consider minifying the JSON file by removing the whitespace. You’ll learn more about minifying JSON data later in the tutorial. Inside the JSON object, you can define zero, one, or more key-value pairs. If you add multiple key-value pairs, then you must separate them with a comma ( ). A key-value pair in a JSON object is separated by a colon ( ). On the left side of the colon, you define a key. A key is a string you must wrap in double quotes ( ). Unlike Python, JSON strings don’t support single quotes ( ). The values in a JSON document are limited to the following data types: Either or without quotes Just like in dictionaries and lists, you’re able to nest data in JSON objects and arrays. For example, you can include an object as the value of an object. Also, you’re free to use any other allowed value as an item in a JSON array. As a Python developer, you may need to pay extra attention to the Boolean values. Instead of using or in title case, you must use the lowercase JavaScript-style Booleans or . Unfortunately, there are some other details in the JSON syntax that you may stumble over as a developer. You’ll have a look at them next. The JSON standard doesn’t allow any comments, trailing commas, or single quotes for strings. This can be confusing to developers who are used to Python dictionaries or JavaScript objects. Here’s a smaller version of the JSON file from before with invalid syntax:\n• Line 5 has a trailing comma after the final key-value pair.\n• Line 10 contains a trailing comma in the array. Using double quotes is something you can get used to as a Python developer. Comments can be helpful in explaining your code, and trailing commas can make moving lines around in your code less fragile. This is why some developers like to use Human JSON (Hjson) or JSON with comments (JSONC). Hjson gives you the freedom to use comments, ditch commas between properties, or create quoteless strings. Apart from the curly braces ( ), the Hjson syntax look like a mix of YAML and JSON. JSONC is a bit stricter than Hjson. Compared to regular JSON, JSONC allows you to use comments and trailing commas. You may have encountered JSONC when editing the file of VS Code. Inside its configuration files, VS Code works in a JSONC mode. For common JSON files, VS Code is more strict and points out JSON syntax errors. If you want to make sure you write valid JSON, then your coding editor can be of great help. The invalid JSON document above contains marks for each occurrence of incorrect JSON syntax: When you don’t want to rely on your code editor, you can also use online tools to verify that the JSON syntax you write is correct. Popular online tools for validating JSON are JSON Lint and JSON Formatter. Later in the tutorial, you’ll learn how to validate JSON documents from the comfort of your terminal. But before that, it’s time to find out how you can work with JSON data in Python.\n\nPython supports the JSON format through the built-in module named . The module is specifically designed for reading and writing strings formatted as JSON. That means you can conveniently convert Python data types into JSON data and the other way around. The act of converting data into the JSON format is referred to as serialization. This process involves transforming data into a series of bytes for storage or transmission over a network. The opposite process, deserialization, involves decoding data from the JSON format back into a usable form within Python. You’ll start with the serialization of Python code into JSON data with the help of the module. One of the most common actions when working with JSON in Python is to convert a Python dictionary into a JSON object. To get an impression of how this works, hop over to your Python REPL and follow along with the code below: After importing the module, you can use to convert a Python dictionary to a JSON-formatted string, which represents a JSON object. It’s important to understand that when you use , you get a Python string in return. In other words, you don’t create any kind of JSON data type. The result is similar to what you’d get if you used Python’s built-in function: Using gets more interesting when your Python dictionary doesn’t contain strings as keys or when values don’t directly translate to a JSON format: In the dictionary, the keys , , and are numbers. Once you use , the dictionary keys become strings in the JSON-formatted string. Note: When you convert a dictionary to JSON, the dictionary keys will always be strings in JSON. The Boolean Python values of your dictionary become JSON Booleans. As mentioned before, the tiny but significant difference between JSON Booleans and Python Booleans is that JSON Booleans are lowercase. The cool thing about Python’s module is that it takes care of the conversion for you. This can come in handy when you’re using variables as dictionary keys: When converting Python data types into JSON, the module receives the evaluated values. While doing so, sticks tightly to the JSON standard. For example, when converting integer keys like to the string . The module allows you to convert common Python data types to JSON. Here’s an overview of all Python data types and values that you can convert to JSON values: Note that different Python data types like lists and tuples serialize to the same JSON data type. This can cause problems when you convert JSON data back to Python, as the data type may not be the same as before. You’ll explore this pitfall later in this tutorial when you learn how to read JSON. Dictionaries are probably the most common Python data type that you’ll use as a top-level value in JSON. But you can convert the data types listed above just as smoothly as dictionaries using . Take a Boolean or a list, for example: A JSON document may contain a single scalar value, like a number, at the top level. That’s still valid JSON. But more often than not, you want to work with a collection of key-value pairs. Similar to how not every data type can be used as a dictionary key in Python, not all keys can be converted into JSON key strings: You can’t use dictionaries, lists, or tuples as JSON keys. For dictionaries and lists, this rule makes sense as they’re not hashable. But even when a tuple is hashable and allowed as a key in a dictionary, you’ll get a when you try to use a tuple as a JSON key: : keys must be str, int, float, bool or None, not tuple By providing the argument, you can prevent getting a when creating JSON data with unsupported Python keys: When you set in to , then Python skips the keys that are not supported and would otherwise raise a . The result is a JSON-formatted string that only contains a subset of the input dictionary. In practice, you usually want your JSON data to resemble the input object as close as possible. So, you must use with caution to not lose information when calling . Note: If you’re ever in a situation where you need to convert an unsupported object into JSON, then you can consider creating a subclass of the and implementing a method. When you use , you can use additional arguments to control the look of the resulting JSON-formatted string. For example, you can sort the dictionary keys by setting the parameter to : When you set to , then Python sorts the keys alphabetically for you when serializing a dictionary. Sorting the keys of a JSON object can come in handy when your dictionary keys formerly represented the column names of a database, and you want to display them in an organized fashion to the user. Another notable parameter of is , which you’ll probably use the most when serializing JSON data. You’ll explore later in this tutorial in the prettify JSON section. When you convert Python data types into the JSON format, you usually have a goal in mind. Most commonly, you’ll use JSON to persist and exchange data. To do so, you need to save your JSON data outside of your running Python program. Conveniently, you’ll explore saving JSON data to a file next. The JSON format can come in handy when you want to save data outside of your Python program. Instead of spinning up a database, you may decide to use a JSON file to store data for your workflows. Again, Python has got you covered. To write Python data into an external JSON file, you use . This is a similar function to the one you saw earlier, but without the s at the end of its name: In lines 3 to 22, you define a dictionary that you write to a JSON file in line 25 using a context manager. To properly indicate that the file contains JSON data, you set the file extension to . When you use , then it’s good practice to define the encoding. For JSON, you commonly want to use as the encoding when reading and writing files: The RFC requires that JSON be represented using either UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32, with UTF-8 being the recommended default for maximum interoperability. (Source) The function has two required arguments:\n• The object you want to write\n• The file you want to write into Other than that, there are a bunch of optional parameters for . The optional parameters of are the same as for . You’ll investigate some of them later in this tutorial when you prettify and minify JSON files.\n\nIn the former sections, you learned how to serialize Python data into JSON-formatted strings and JSON files. Now, you’ll see what happens when you load JSON data back into your Python program. In parallel to and , the library provides two functions to deserialize JSON data into a Python object: As a rule of thumb, you work with when your data is already present in your Python program. You use with external files that are saved on your disk. The conversion from JSON data types and values to Python follows a similar mapping as before when you converted Python objects into the JSON format: When you compare this table to the one in the previous section, you may recognize that Python offers a matching data type for all JSON types. That’s very convenient because this way, you can be sure you won’t lose any information when deserializing JSON data to Python. Note: Deserialization is not the exact reverse of the serialization process. The reason for this is that JSON keys are always strings, and not all Python data types can be converted to JSON data types. This discrepancy means that certain Python objects may not retain their original type when serialized and then deserialized. To get a better feeling for the conversion of data types, you’ll start with serializing a Python object to JSON and then convert the JSON data back to Python. That way, you can spot differences between the Python object you serialize and the Python object you end up with after deserializing the JSON data. To investigate how to load a Python dictionary from a JSON object, revisit the example from before. Start by creating a dictionary and then serialize the Python dictionary to a JSON string using : By passing into , you’re creating a string with a JSON object that you save in . If you want to convert back to a Python dictionary, then you can use : By using , you can convert JSON data back into Python objects. With the knowledge about JSON that you’ve gained so far, you may already suspect that the content of the dictionary is not identical to the content of : The difference between and is subtle but can be impactful in your Python programs. In JSON, the keys must always be strings. When you converted to using , the integer key became the string . When you used , there was no way for Python to know that the string key should be an integer again. That’s why your dictionary key remained a string after deserialization. You’ll investigate a similar behavior by doing another conversion roundtrip with other Python data types! To explore how different data types behave in a roundtrip from Python to JSON and back, take a portion of the dictionary from a former section. Note how the dictionary contains different data types as values: The dictionary contains a bunch of common Python data types as values. For example, a string in line 2, a Boolean in line 3, a in line 7, and a tuple in line 8, just to name a few. Next, convert to a JSON-formatted string and back to Python again. Afterward, have a look at the newly created dictionary: You can convert every JSON data type perfectly into a matching Python data type. The JSON Boolean deserializes into , converts back into , and objects and arrays become dictionaries and lists. Still, there’s one exception that you may encounter in roundtrips: When you serialize a Python tuple, it becomes a JSON array. When you load JSON, a JSON array correctly deserializes into a list because Python has no way of knowing that you want the array to be a tuple. Problems like the one described above can always be an issue when you’re doing data roundtrips. When the roundtrip happens in the same program, you may be more aware of the expected data types. Data type conversions may be even more obfuscated when you’re dealing with external JSON files that originated in another program. You’ll investigate a situation like this next! In a previous section, you created a file that saved a file. If you need to refresh your memory, you can expand the collapsible section below that shows the code again: Take a look at the data types of the dictionary. Is there a data type in a value that the JSON format doesn’t support? When you want to write content to a JSON file, you use . The counterpart to is . As the name suggests, you can use to load a JSON file into your Python program. Jump back into the Python REPL and load the JSON file from before: Just like when writing files, it’s a good idea to use a context manager when reading a file in Python. That way, you don’t need to bother with closing the file again. When you want to read a JSON file, then you use inside the statement’s block. The argument for the function must be either a text file or a binary file. The Python object that you get from depends on the top-level data type of your JSON file. In this case, the JSON file contains an object at the top level, which deserializes into a dictionary. When you deserialize a JSON file as a Python object, then you can interact with it natively—for example, by accessing the value of the key with square bracket notation ( ). Still, there’s a word of caution here. Import the original dictionary from before and compare it to : When you load a JSON file as a Python object, then any JSON data type happily deserializes into Python. That’s because Python knows about all data types that the JSON format supports. Unfortunately, it’s not the same the other way around. As you learned before, there are Python data types like that you can convert into JSON, but you’ll end up with an data type in the JSON file. Once you convert the JSON data back to Python, then an array deserializes into the Python data type. Generally, being cautious about data type conversions should be the concern of the Python program that writes the JSON. With the knowledge you have about JSON files, you can always anticipate which Python data types you’ll end up with as long as the JSON file is valid. If you use , then the content of the file you load must contain valid JSON syntax. Otherwise, you’ll receive a . Luckily, Python caters to you with more tools you can use to interact with JSON. For example, it allows you to check a JSON file’s validity from the convenience of the terminal.\n\nSo far, you’ve explored the JSON syntax and have already spotted some common JSON pitfalls like trailing commas and single quotes for strings. When writing JSON, you may have also spotted some annoying details. For example, neatly indented Python dictionaries end up being a blob of JSON data. In the last section of this tutorial, you’ll try out some techniques to make your life easier as you work with JSON data in Python. To start, you’ll give your JSON object a well-deserved glow-up. One huge advantage of the JSON format is that JSON data is human-readable. Even more so, JSON data is human-writable. This means you can open a JSON file in your favorite text editor and change the content to your liking. Well, that’s the idea, at least! Editing JSON data by hand is not particularly easy when your JSON data looks like this in the text editor: Even with word wrapping and syntax highlighting turned on, JSON data is hard to read when it’s a single line of code. And as a Python developer, you probably miss some whitespace. But worry not, Python has got you covered! When you call or to serialize a Python object, then you can provide the argument. Start by trying out with different indentation levels: The default value for is . When you call without or with as a value, you’ll end up with one line of a compact JSON-formatted string. If you want linebreaks in your JSON string, then you can set to or provide an empty string. Although probably less useful, you can even provide a negative number as the indentation or any other string. More commonly, you’ll provide values like or for : When you use positive integers as the value for when calling , then you’ll indent every level of the JSON object with the given count as spaces. Also, you’ll have newlines for each key-value pair. Note: To actually see the whitespace in the REPL, you can wrap the calls in function calls. The parameter works exactly the same for as it does for . Go ahead and write the dictionary into a JSON file with an indentation of spaces: When you set the indentation level when serializing JSON data, then you end up with prettified JSON data. Have a look at how the file looks in your editor: Python can work with JSON files no matter how they’re indented. As a human, you probably prefer a JSON file that contains newlines and is neatly indented. A JSON file that looks like this is way more convenient to edit. The convenience of being able to edit JSON data in the editor comes with a risk. When you move key-value pairs around or add strings with one quote instead of two, you end up with an invalid JSON. To swiftly check if a JSON file is valid, you can leverage Python’s . You can run the module as an executable in the terminal using the switch. To see in action, also provide as the positional argument: When you run only with an option, then Python validates the JSON file and outputs the JSON file’s content in the terminal if the JSON is valid. Running in the example above means that contains valid JSON syntax. Note: The prints the JSON data with an indentation of 4 by default. You’ll explore this behavior in the next section. To make complain, you need to invalidate your JSON document. You can make the JSON data of invalid by removing the comma ( ) between the key-value pairs: After saving , run again to validate the file: The module successfully stumbles over the missing comma in . Python notices that there’s a delimiter missing once the property name enclosed in double quotes starts in line 3 at position 5. Go ahead and try fixing the JSON file again. You can also be creative with invalidating and check how reports your error. But keep in mind that only reports the first error. So you may need to go back and forth between fixing a JSON file and running . Once is valid, you may notice that the output always looks the same. Of course, like any well-made command-line interface, offers you some options to control the program. In the previous section, you used to validate a JSON file. When the JSON syntax was valid, showed the content with newlines and an indentation of four spaces. To control how prints the JSON, you can set the option. If you followed along with the tutorial, then you’ve got a file that doesn’t contain newlines or indentation. Alternatively, you can download in the materials by clicking the link below: Free Bonus: Click here to download the free sample code that shows you how to work with JSON data in Python. When you pass in to , then you can pretty print the content of the JSON file in your terminal. When you set , then you can control which indentation level uses to display the code: Seeing the prettified JSON data in the terminal is nifty. But you can step up your game even more by providing another option to the run! By default, writes the output to , just like you commonly do when calling the function. But you can also redirect the output of into a file by providing a positional argument: With as the value of the option, you write the output into the JSON file instead of showing the content in the terminal. If the file doesn’t exist yet, then Python creates the file on the way. If the target file already exists, then you overwrite the file with the new content. Note: You can prettify a JSON file in place by using the same file as and arguments. You can verify that the file exists by running the terminal command: The whitespace you added to comes with a price. Compared to the original, unindented file, the file size of is now around double that. Here, the 308-byte increase may not be significant. But when you’re dealing with big JSON data, then a good-looking JSON file will take up quite a bit of space. Having a small data footprint is especially useful when serving data over the web. Since the JSON format is the de facto standard for exchanging data over the web, it’s worth keeping the file size as small as possible. And again, Python’s has got your back! As you know by now, Python is a great helper when working with JSON. You can minify JSON data with Python in two ways:\n• Use the module in your Python code Before, you used with the option to add whitespace. Instead of using here, you can use provide to do the opposite and remove any whitespace between the key-value pairs of your JSON: After calling the module, you provide a JSON file as the and another JSON file as the . If the target JSON file exists, then you overwrite its contents. Otherwise, you create a new file with the filename you provide. Just like with , you provide the same file as a source and target file to minify the file in-place. In the example above, you minify into . Run the command to see how many bytes you squeezed out of the original JSON file: Compared to , the file size of is 337 bytes smaller. That’s even 29 bytes less than the original file that didn’t contain any indentation. To investigate where Python managed to remove even more whitespace from the original JSON, open the Python REPL again and minify the content of the original file with Python’s module: In the code above, you use Python’s to get the content of as text. Then, you use to deserialize to , which is a Python dictionary. You could use to get a Python dictionary right away, but you need the JSON data as a string first to compare it properly. That’s also why you use to create and then use instead of leveraging directly to save the minified JSON data in . As you learned before, needs JSON data as the first argument and then accepts a value for the indentation. The default value for is , so you could skip setting the argument explicitly like you do above. But with , you’re making your intention clear that you don’t want any indentation, which will be a good thing for others who read your code later. The parameter for allows you to define a tuple with two values:\n• The separator between the key-value pairs or list items. By default, this separator is a comma followed by a space ( ).\n• The separator between the key and the value. By default, this separator is a colon followed by a space ( ). By setting to , you continue to use valid JSON separators. But you tell Python not to add any spaces after the comma ( ) and the colon ( ). That means that the only whitespace left in your JSON data can be whitespace appearing in key names and values. That’s pretty tight! With both and containing your JSON strings, it’s time to compare them: You can already spot the difference between and when you look at the output. You then use the function to verify that the size of is indeed smaller. If you’re curious about why the length of the JSON strings almost exactly matches the file size of the written files, then looking into Unicode & character encodings in Python is a great idea. Both and are excellent helpers when you want to make JSON data look prettier, or if you want to minify JSON data to save some bytes. With the module, you can conveniently interact with JSON data in your Python programs. That’s great when you need to have more control over the way you interact with JSON. The module comes in handy when you want to work with JSON data directly in your terminal."
