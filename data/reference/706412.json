A binary tree has a limitation as any node of the tree has at most two children: a left and a right child.\n\nA complete binary tree is a special type of binary tree where all the levels of the tree are filled completely except the lowest level nodes which are filled from as left as possible.\n• Root – Node in which no edge is coming from the parent. Example -node A\n• Child – Node having some incoming edge is called child. Example – nodes B, F are the child of A and C respectively.\n• Sibling – Nodes having the same parent are sibling. Example- D, E are siblings as they have the same parent B.\n• Degree of a node – Number of children of a particular parent. Example- Degree of A is 2 and Degree of C is 1. Degree of D is 0.\n• Internal/External nodes – Leaf nodes are external nodes and non leaf nodes are internal nodes.\n• Level – Count nodes in a path to reach a destination node. Example- Level of node D is 2 as nodes A and B form the path.\n• Height – Number of edges to reach the destination node, Root is at height 0. Example – Height of node E is 2 as it has two edges from the root.\n• None A complete binary tree is said to be a proper binary tree where all leaves have the same depth.\n• None In a complete binary tree number of nodes at depth d 2d\n• n nodes height of the tree is log(n+1)\n• except the last level\n\nA binary tree of height ‘h’ having the maximum number of nodes is a perfect binary tree. \n\nFor a given height h, the maximum number of nodes is 2h+1-1.\n\nA complete binary tree of height h is a perfect binary tree up to height h-1, and in the last level element are stored in left to right order.\n\nThe height of the given binary tree is 2 and the maximum number of nodes in that tree is n= 2h+1-1 = 22+1-1 = 23-1 = 7.\n\nHence we can conclude it is a perfect binary tree.\n\nNow for a complete binary tree, It is full up to height h-1 i.e.; 1, and the last level elements are stored in left to right order. Hence it is a complete Binary tree also. Here is the representation of elements when stored in an array\n\nIn the array, all the elements are stored continuously.\n\nHeight of the given binary tree is 2 and the maximum number of nodes that should be there are 2h+1 – 1 = 22+1 – 1 = 23 – 1 = 7. \n\nBut the number of nodes in the tree is 6. Hence it is not a perfect binary tree.\n\nNow for a complete binary tree, It is full up to height h-1 i.e.; 1, and the last level element are stored in left to right order. Hence this is a complete binary tree. Store the element in an array and it will be like;\n\nThe height of the binary tree is 2 and the maximum number of nodes that can be there is 7, but there are only 5 nodes hence it is not a perfect binary tree.\n\nIn case of a complete binary tree, we see that in the last level elements are not filled from left to right order.

Hence it is a full binary tree.\n\nFor a complete binary tree, elements are stored in a level by level manner and filled from the leftmost side of the last level. Hence this a complete binary tree.

        "document": "If I had to pick the single most important topic in software development, it would be data structures. One of the most common and easiest ones is a tree — a hierarchical data structure. In this article, let’s explore Trees in Java.\n\nA is a non-linear data structure where data objects are generally organized in terms of hierarchical relationship. The structure is non-linear in the sense that, unlike Arrays, Linked Lists, Stack and Queues, data in a tree is not organized linearly. A binary tree is a recursive tree data structure where each node can have 2 children at most.\n\nBinary trees have a few interesting properties when they’re perfect:\n• Property 1: The number of total nodes on each “level” doubles as you move down the tree.\n• Property 2: The number of nodes on the last level is equal to the sum of the number of nodes on all other levels, plus 1\n\nEach data element stored in a tree structure called a node. A Tree node contains the following parts:\n\n 1. Data\n\n3. Pointer to the right child\n\nIn Java, we can represent a tree node using class. Below is an example of a tree node with integer data.\n\nNow that you know what is a binary tree, let’s check out different types of binary trees.\n\nA full binary tree is a binary tree where every node has exactly 0 or 2 children. The example of fully binary tress is:\n\nA binary tree is perfect binary Tree if all internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level. The example of perfect binary tress is:\n\nA complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible. An example of a complete binary tree is:\n\nNow that you are aware of different types of binary trees, let’s check out how to create a binary tree.\n\nFor the implementation, there’s an auxiliary Node class that will store int values and keeps a reference to each child. The first step is to find the place where we want to add a new node in order to keep the tree sorted. We’ll follow these rules starting from the root node:\n• if the new node’s value is lower than the current node’s, go to the left child\n• if the new node’s value is greater than the current node’s, go to the right child\n• when the current node is null, we’ve reached a leaf node, we insert the new node in that position\n\nNow let’s see how we can implement this logic with the help of an example:\n\nIn this example, we have used in-order traversal to traverse the tree. The in-order traversal consists of first visiting the left sub-tree, then the root node, and finally the right sub-tree. There are more ways to traverse a tree. Let’s check them out.\n\nTrees can be traversed in several ways: Let’s use the same tree example that we used before for each case.\n\nDepth-first search is a type of traversal where you go as deep as possible down one path before backing up and trying a different one. There are several ways to perform a depth-first search: in-order, pre-order and post-order.\n\nWe already checked out in-order traversal. Let’s check out pre-order and post-order now.\n\nIn Pre-order traversal you visit the root node first, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree. Here’s the code.\n\nIn Post-order traversal you visit left subtree first, then the right subtree, and the root node at the end. Here’s the code.\n\nThis type of traversal visits all the nodes of a level before going to the next level. It is like throwing a stone in the center of a pond. The nodes you explore “ripple out” from the starting point. Breadth-First Search is also called level-order and visits all the levels of the tree starting from the root, and from left to right.\n• Used in many search applications where data is constantly entering/leaving\n• As a workflow for compositing digital images for visual effects\n• Used in almost every high-bandwidth router for storing router-tables\n• Also used in wireless networking and memory allocation\n• Used in compression algorithms and many more\n\nThis brings us to the end of this ‘Trees in Java’ article.\n\nMake sure you practice as much as possible and revert your experience.\n\nIf you wish to check out more articles on the market’s most trending technologies like Artificial Intelligence, DevOps, Ethical Hacking, then you can refer to Edureka’s official site.\n\nDo look out for other articles in this series which will explain the various other aspects of Java."

        "document": "The tree data structure is a type of graph. A tree has a root node (top node) that will have a relationship with its child nodes. The path that connects the root node to the child nodes is called a branch. The leaf node is the node that doesn’t have any children and is not the root node.\n\nIn algorithms, you will see a lot of the nomenclature height. Height in trees is the number of nodes from the highest branch to the root node. Another keyword is the depth of a tree which means the count of nodes from a specific node to the root node.\n\nTo make those nomenclatures clear, let’s see them in a diagram:\n\nA real-world example is the hierarchy of a company. For example:\n\nTo follow and run your own tests from the following code examples, you can download the code here!\n\nLet’s see a simple way to represent this data in Java code:\n\nNotice that the code above is very similar to the graph data structure. We are also using the Breadth-first search algorithm to show the data from the tree. For now, don’t worry about it, just keep in mind that this is a famous algorithm that will visit and print each node. Now let’s populate the data from the company hierarchy in the Tree data structure:\n\nAnother example is the way file system on a computer. There is a hierarchy of compartments within the computer to organize files. For example, there is the root computer compartment and then users, the Desktop, and finally your file. This is a classic example of a tree data structure.\n\nA tree can’t have cycles and each node can’t have more than one parent.\n\nA binary tree is a tree that has up to 2 child nodes. Let’s see how that works in a diagram:\n\nNotice that the diagram above is a binary tree because the nodes have up to 2 children at max. Even though node 3 has only one child that still makes the above diagram a binary tree.\n\nA ternary tree is similar to the binary tree but instead of having up to 2 child nodes, it has up to 3 child nodes. Let’s see how this is represented in a diagram:\n\nNotice in the diagram above that node 1 and node 2 has 3 child nodes. Even though node 4 has only one child node this also doesn’t matter, it’s still a ternary tree since the max number of child nodes is 3.\n\nThe “K” represents the max number of child nodes a tree can have. For example, we can represent a binary tree as a 2-ary tree because both mean that the tree can have up to 2 child nodes. Similarly, a 3-ary tree is the same as a ternary tree\n\nA perfect binary tree has the same depth for every child node to the leaf nodes. Let’s see how to represent it in a diagram:\n\nA complete binary tree contains its nodes complete for the leftmost nodes. Also, the interior nodes have to have two child nodes. Only the leaf nodes that are not the leftmost are allowed to not have child nodes.\n\nRemember that if the binary tree is complete only for the rightmost nodes, that wouldn’t be considered a complete binary tree.\n\nWhen a tree has either two or zero child nodes, it’s considered a full binary tree. To illustrate a full binary tree, take a look at the following diagram:\n\nA balanced tree can’t have its subtrees heights with more than 1 level of difference between the left and right subtrees. Let’s see an example to understand it more clearly:\n\nNotice in the diagram above that the total height of this tree is 3. The height of the left nodes 4 and 5 is 3. The height of node 3 is 2. Therefore, the difference between the node subtrees is 1, and for this reason, is a balanced tree.\n\nThe following diagram is an example of a non-balanced binary tree. That’s because the height from the left subtrees is higher than 1 compared to the right subtrees:\n\nNote that in the diagram above node 6 has a height of 4. Node 3 which is on the right has a height of 2. Therefore, the difference in the height of the nodes is higher than 1 and for this reason, the tree above is not a balanced tree."

Imagine a situation when you need to swiftly get information from a contact list or dictionary, Because binary trees are structured, you can accomplish this effectively with them. Compared to other data structures, you can complete tasks like search, insert, and delete rather quickly.\n\nIn this DSA tutorial, we will see the binary tree in detail learning about its features, working, types, implementation, etc. to further enhance your understanding and application of binary tree concepts. You can also go through our Data Structures and Algorithms Course.\n\nWhat is a Binary Tree in Data Structures?\n\nA binary tree is the specialized version of the General tree. In this, according to the name, , each parent node can have at most two nodes or two children i.e. left and right child.\n\nA Binary tree is represented by a pointer to the topmost node known as the node. If the tree is empty, the value of the root is . Each node of a Binary Tree contains the following three elements:\n• Pointer to the right child\n• Node: In a binary tree, a node refers to a data element stored in the tree. They contain the address of the left and right child.\n• Root: In a binary tree, the is the topmost node of the tree. It is the starting point of the tree from which all other nodes branch out. A tree can have at most one root node.\n• Parent Node: A node (except the root) that has a succeeding node is known as a parent node.\n• Child Node: A node that has a preceding node is known as a child node. A node can be both parent and child depending on the node that is in context.\n• Leaf Node: A leaf node in a binary tree is a node that does not have any children i.e. terminal node in the tree.\n• Internal Node: In a binary tree, an internal node is a node that has at least one child.\n• Depth of a Tree: The depth of a tree in a binary tree refers to the length of the longest path from the root node to any leaf node in the tree.\n• Height of a Tree: The number of edges from the deepest node in the tree to the root node.\n\nA full binary tree, also known as a proper binary tree or a strictly binary tree, is a type of binary tree in which every node has either zero or two children. Additionally, all leaf nodes are at the same level.\n• The number of internal nodes is if is the number of total nodes.\n• The number of leaf nodes is equal to the number of internal nodes plus 1.\n• The maximum number of nodes is the same as the number of nodes in the binary tree with height , i.e., .\n• The minimum number of nodes in the full binary tree with height is .\n• The minimum height of the full binary tree is .\n\nA complete binary tree is a full binary tree but with some major differences\n• Every level must be filled completely except the last level which may or may not be completely filled.\n• All the leaf elements must lean towards the left.\n• The last leaf element might not have a right sibling i.e. a complete binary tree doesn't have to be a full binary tree.\n• The maximum number of nodes in a complete binary tree is .\n• The minimum number of nodes in a complete binary tree is .\n• The minimum height of a complete binary tree is .\n\nA perfect binary tree is a type of binary tree in which every internal node has exactly two child nodes and all the leaf nodes are at the same level.\n• The number of nodes in a perfect binary tree can be calculated using the formula , where is the height or depth of the tree.\n• The height of a perfect binary tree can be calculated using the formula , where is the number of nodes in the tree.\n• The root node of a perfect binary tree is always at level 0.\n• The number of nodes in the last level of a perfect binary tree is equal to , where is the height of the tree.\n• The maximum number of nodes at any level of a perfect binary tree is , where is the level number.\n• The minimum height of a perfect binary tree with nodes is .\n\nA degenerate binary tree, also known as a pathological tree, is a special type of binary tree where each parent node has only one child node. In other words, it is a tree in which all the internal nodes have a degree of , and only the leaf nodes have a degree of .\n\nDegenerate binary trees can also be classified into two types\n• Left-skewed: A degenerate binary tree in which all the nodes lean towards the left side of the tree.\n• Right-skewed: A degenerate binary tree in which all the nodes lean towards the right side of the tree.\n\nA balanced binary tree is a type of binary tree in which the difference in height between the left and right subtrees of any node is at most one.\n\nBased on node values, the Binary Tree can be classified into the following special types:\n• Binary Search Tree: In this, the value of the left node must be smaller than the parent node, and the value of the right node must be greater than the parent node. We will learn more on this topic in Binary Search Trees in Data Structures\n• AVL Tree: It is a self-balancing binary search tree where the difference between the heights of left and right subtrees for any node is not more than one. We will learn more on this topic in AVL Tree in Data Structures\n• Red Black Tree: It is a type of self-balancing binary search tree where each node has an extra bit, and that bit is often interpreted as the color ( or ). These colors ensure that the tree remains balanced during insertions and deletions.\n• B Tree: It has a fixed maximum degree (or order), which determines the maximum number of child nodes that a parent node can have. Each node in a B-tree can have multiple child nodes and multiple keys, which are used to index and locate data items.\n• B+ Tree: It is a type of B-tree and also has a fixed maximum degree. in a B+ tree, all data items are stored in the leaf nodes, while the internal nodes only contain keys for indexing and locating the data items.\n• Segment Tree: It is a tree data structure used for storing information about intervals, or segments.\n\nHow to declare/create a Binary Tree in Data Structures?\n\nImplementation of a Binary Tree in Different Programming Languages\n• Space Complexity: The space complexity of the Binary Tree for all operations is .\n• Search algorithms: Binary search algorithms use the structure of binary trees to efficiently search for a specific element.\n• Sorting algorithms: Binary trees can be used to implement efficient sorting algorithms, such as tree sort and heap sort.\n• Database systems: Binary trees can be used to store data in a database system, with each node representing a record. This allows for efficient search operations and enables the database system to handle large amounts of data.\n• File systems: Binary trees can be used to implement file systems, where each node represents a directory or file.\n• Compression algorithms: Binary trees can be used to implement Huffman coding, a compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to characters based on their frequency of occurrence in the input data.\n• Decision trees: Binary trees can be used to implement decision trees.\n• Game AI: Binary trees can be used to implement game AI, where each node represents a possible move in the game. The AI algorithm can search the tree to find the best possible move.\n• Efficient searching: Binary trees are particularly efficient when searching for a specific element, as each node has at most two child nodes, allowing for binary search algorithms to be used.\n• Ordered traversal: The structure of binary trees enables them to be traversed in a specific order, such as in-order traversal, pre-order traversal, and post-order traversal.\n• Memory efficiency: Compared to other tree structures, binary trees are relatively memory-efficient because they only require two child pointers per node.\n• Easy to implement: Binary trees are relatively easy to implement and understand, making them a popular choice for a wide range of applications.\n• Limited structure: Binary trees are limited to two child nodes per node, which can limit their usefulness in certain applications.\n• Unbalanced trees: Unbalanced binary trees, can lead to inefficient search operations. This can occur if the tree is not properly balanced or if data is inserted in a non-random order.\n• Space inefficiency: Binary trees can be space inefficient when compared to other data structures. This is because each node requires two child pointers, which can be a significant amount of memory overhead for large trees.\n• Slow performance in worst-case scenarios: In the worst-case scenario, a binary tree can become degenerate, meaning that each node has only one child. In this case, search operations can degrade to time complexity.\n• Complex balancing algorithms: To ensure that binary trees remain balanced, various balancing algorithms can be used, such as AVL trees and red-black trees. These algorithms can be complex to implement and require additional overhead, making them less suitable for some applications.\n\nThe tutorial covers all the aspects from definition to advantages and disadvantages of binary trees in data structures. The topic is very important to understand other topics like binary search trees, AVL trees, segment trees, etc. Therefore refer to the tutorial until you get thorough with every detail of binary tree.
