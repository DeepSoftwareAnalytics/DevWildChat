        "document": "Follow this guide to get familiar with all major concepts of Chart.js: chart types and elements, datasets, customization, plugins, components, and tree-shaking. Don't hesitate to follow the links in the text.\n\nWe'll build a Chart.js data visualization with a couple of charts from scratch:\n\nIn a new folder, create the file with the following contents:\n\nModern front-end applications often use JavaScript module bundlers, so we’ve picked Parcel (opens new window) as a nice zero-configuration build tool. We’re also installing Chart.js v4 and a JavaScript client for Cube (opens new window), an open-source API for data apps we’ll use to fetch real-world data (more on that later).\n\nRun , , or to install the dependencies, then create the folder. Inside that folder, we’ll need a very simple file:\n\nAs you can see, Chart.js requires minimal markup: a tag with an by which we’ll reference the chart later. By default, Chart.js charts are responsive and take the whole enclosing container. So, we set the width of the to control chart width.\n\nLastly, let’s create the file with the following contents:\n• We import , the main Chart.js class, from the special path. It loads all available Chart.js components (which is very convenient) but disallows tree-shaking. We’ll address that later.\n• We instantiate a new instance and provide two arguments: the canvas element where the chart would be rendered and the options object.\n• We just need to provide a chart type ( ) and provide which consists of (often, numeric or textual descriptions of data points) and an array of (Chart.js supports multiple datasets for most chart types). Each dataset is designated with a and contains an array of data points.\n• For now, we only have a few entries of dummy data. So, we extract and properties to produce the arrays of and data points within the only dataset.\n\nTime to run the example with , , or and navigate to localhost:1234 (opens new window) in your web browser:\n\nWith just a few lines of code, we’ve got a chart with a lot of features: a legend, grid lines, ticks, and tooltips shown on hover. Refresh the web page a few times to see that the chart is also animated. Try clicking on the “Acquisitions by year” label to see that you’re also able to toggle datasets visibility (especially useful when you have multiple datasets).\n\nLet’s see how Chart.js charts can be customized. First, let’s turn off the animations so the chart appears instantly. Second, let’s hide the legend and tooltips since we have only one dataset and pretty trivial data.\n\nReplace the invocation in with the following snippet:\n\nAs you can see, we’ve added the property to the second argument—that’s how you can specify all kinds of customization options for Chart.js. The animation is disabled with a boolean flag provided via . Most chart-wide options (e.g., responsiveness or device pixel ratio) are configured like this.\n\nThe legend and tooltips are hidden with boolean flags provided under the respective sections in . Note that some of Chart.js features are extracted into plugins: self-contained, separate pieces of code. A few of them are available as a part of Chart.js distribution (opens new window), other plugins are maintained independently and can be located in the awesome list (opens new window) of plugins, framework integrations, and additional chart types.\n\nYou should be able to see the updated minimalistic chart in your browser.\n\nWith hardcoded, limited-size, unrealistic data, it’s hard to show the full potential of Chart.js. Let’s quickly connect to a data API to make our example application closer to a production use case.\n\nLet’s create the file with the following contents:\n• We the JavaScript client library for Cube , an open-source API for data apps, configure it with the API URL ( ) and the authentication token ( ), and finally instantiate the client ( ).\n• Cube API is hosted in Cube Cloud and connected to a database with a public dataset of ~140,000 records representing all of the artworks in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, USA. Certainly, a more real-world dataset than what we’ve got now.\n• We define a couple of asynchronous functions to fetch data from the API: and . The first one returns the number of artworks by the year of acquisition, the other returns the number of artworks for every width-height pair (we’ll need it for another chart).\n• Let’s take a look at . First, we create a declarative, JSON-based query in the variable. As you can see, we specify that for every we’d like to get the of artworks; has to be set (i.e., not undefined); the result set would be sorted by in the ascending order.\n• Second, we fetch the by calling and map it to an array of objects with desired and properties.\n\nNow, let’s deliver the real-world data to our chart. Please apply a couple of changes to : add an import and replace the definition of the variable.\n\nDone! Now, our chart with real-world data looks like this. Looks like something interesting happened in 1964, 1968, and 2008!\n\nWe’re done with the bar chart. Let’s try another Chart.js chart type.\n\nFor instance, Bubble chart allows to display three dimensions of data at the same time: locations on and axes represent two dimensions, and the third dimension is represented by the size of the individual bubbles.\n\nTo create the chart, stop the already running application, then go to , and uncomment the following two lines:\n\nThen, create the file with the following contents:\n\nProbably, everything is pretty straightforward there: we get data from the API and render a new chart with the type, passing three dimensions of data as , , and (radius) properties.\n\nNow, reset caches with and start the application again with , , or . We can review the new chart now:\n\nWell, it doesn’t look pretty.\n\nFirst of all, the chart is not square. Artworks’ width and height are equally important so we’d like to make the chart width equal to its height as well. By default, Chart.js charts have the aspect ratio of either 1 (for all radial charts, e.g., a doughnut chart) or 2 (for all the rest). Let’s modify the aspect ratio for our chart:\n\nLooks much better now:\n\nHowever, it’s still not ideal. The horizontal axis spans from 0 to 500 while the vertical axis spans from 0 to 450. By default, Chart.js automatically adjusts the range (minimum and maximum values) of the axes to the values provided in the dataset, so the chart “fits” your data. Apparently, MoMa collection doesn’t have artworks in the range of 450 to 500 cm in height. Let’s modify the axes configuration for our chart to account for that:\n\nHowever, there’s one more nitpick: what are these numbers? It’s not very obvious that the units are centimetres. Let’s apply a custom tick format to both axes to make things clear. We’ll provide a callback function that would be called to format each tick value. Here’s the updated axes configuration:\n\nPerfect, now we have proper units on both axes:\n\nChart.js plots each dataset independently and allows to apply custom styles to them.\n\nTake a look at the chart: there’s a visible “line” of bubbles with equal and coordinates representing square artworks. It would be cool to put these bubbles in their own dataset and paint them differently. Also, we can separate “taller” artworks from “wider” ones and paint them differently, too.\n\nHere’s how we can do that. Replace the with the following code:\n\nAs you can see, we define three datasets with different labels. Each dataset gets its own slice of data extracted with . Now they are visually distinct and, as you already know, you can toggle their visibility independently.\n\nHere we rely on the default color palette. However, keep in mind every chart type supports a lot of dataset options that you can feel free to customize.\n\nAnother—and very powerful!—way to customize Chart.js charts is to use plugins. You can find some in the plugin directory (opens new window) or create your own, ad-hoc ones. In Chart.js ecosystem, it’s idiomatic and expected to fine tune charts with plugins. For example, you can customize canvas background or add a border to it with simple ad-hoc plugins. Let’s try the latter.\n\nPlugins have an extensive API but, in a nutshell, a plugin is defined as an object with a and one or more callback functions defined in the extension points. Insert the following snippet before and in place of the invocation in :\n\nAs you can see, in this plugin, we acquire the canvas context, save its current state, apply styles, draw a rectangular shape around the chart area, and restore the canvas state. We’re also passing the plugin in so it’s only applied to this particular chart. We also pass the plugin options in ; we could surely hardcode them in the plugin source code but it’s much more reusable this way.\n\nOur bubble chart looks fancier now:\n\nIn production, we strive to ship as little code as possible, so the end users can load our data applications faster and have better experience. For that, we’ll need to apply tree-shaking (opens new window) which is fancy term for removing unused code from the JavaScript bundle.\n\nChart.js fully supports tree-shaking with its component design. You can register all Chart.js components at once (which is convenient when you’re prototyping) and get them bundled with your application. Or, you can register only necessary components and get a minimal bundle, much less in size.\n\nLet’s inspect our example application. What’s the bundle size? You can stop the application and run , or , or . In a few moments, you’ll get something like this:\n\nWe can see that Chart.js and other dependencies were bundled together in a single 265 KB file.\n\nTo reduce the bundle size, we’ll need to apply a couple of changes to and . First, we’ll need to remove the following import statement from both files: .\n\nInstead, let’s load only necessary components and “register” them with Chart.js using . Here’s what we need in :\n\nAnd here’s the snippet for :\n\nYou can see that, in addition to the class, we’re also loading a controller for the chart type, scales, and other chart elements (e.g., bars or points). You can look all available components up in the documentation.\n\nAlternatively, you can follow Chart.js advice in the console. For example, if you forget to import for your bar chart, you’ll see the following message in the browser console:\n\nRemember to carefully check for imports from when preparing your application for production. It takes only one import like this to effectively disable tree-shaking.\n\nNow, let’s inspect our application once again. Run and you’ll get something like this:\n\nBy importing and registering only select components, we’ve removed more than 56 KB of unnecessary code. Given that other dependencies take ~50 KB in the bundle, tree-shaking helps remove ~25% of Chart.js code from the bundle for our example application.\n\nNow you’re familiar with all major concepts of Chart.js: chart types and elements, datasets, customization, plugins, components, and tree-shaking.\n\nFeel free to review many examples of charts in the documentation and check the awesome list (opens new window) of Chart.js plugins and additional chart types as well as framework integrations (opens new window) (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte, etc.). Also, don’t hesitate to join Chart.js Discord (opens new window) and follow Chart.js on Twitter (opens new window).\n\nHave fun and good luck building with Chart.js!"

        "document": "I got a detailed design of a line chart to implement within a React interface. After browsing briefly for suitable library for graphs and charts visualizations, I decided to go with Chart.js and it’s dedicated React package react-chartjs-2. I installed a version 3.7 of Chart.js, which was the most current at a time.\n\nWhile I am overall happy with the library, I found the documentation limited for versions higher than 3.0 in comparison to examples I found for previous versions. Newest versions of the library are not backwards compatible, so I got pretty frustrated knowing something should be possible within the library, but having not enough information how to achieve it.\n\nHere is small showcase of examples you might find useful.\n• Different tick styles on an axis\n• Hide legend when you hide the dataset\n• Manage ticks: Limit the distribution of the ticks\n\nCreating custom tooltip in Chart.js requires creating a custom DOM element. Examples show how do this programmatically. Personally I found example in library samples too complicated for my use, also I wanted to use jsx elements and be able to style my elements like normal person, not via JavaScript. Here is how I did it in steps:\n• Hook it on the chart object — you need it to reference the graph positions\n• Create a default tooltip state to store info for the tooltip\n• Use inline tooltip plugin of Chart.js to modify tooltip data\n\nDifferent tick styles on an axis\n\nYou might want to single out certain ticks with different color. There is apparently a function, but I was in conflict with Typescript types. What I found out instead is that property can be a scriptable option:\n\nOf course the condition can be more elaborate than just a direct compare.\n\nproperty is also scriptable option. You need to figure out how to extend font object with your modified value.\n\nHide legend when you hide the dataset\n\nHiding a dataset is fairly simple, all you need to do is to add property to the dataset itself. The thing is, the label then in the legend is being crossed-out (and there is not much to do about it).\n\nIn versions < 3.0 you could have change the hidden dataset label’s style, but I could not find that option in the newest version. Any tips on that are very much welcome. I found the solution of altering the library code, which is not acceptable.\n\nI found out that you can easily hide the label like so:\n\nFew use cases for this one:\n\nThe condition can of course be whatever you want, you might choose specific ticks or in this case show only even ticks or whatever rocks your boat:\n\nLimit the distribution of the ticks\n\nThis function is very arbitrary because that is what I needed, you are free to make any flexible condition you want:\n\nThere are nice examples of that in documentation, but I made a slightly neater version for React (TypeScript):\n\nBy no means play with canvas styles. Style the parent component instead. For make child behave, follow this steps:\n• Add to the chart object to scale properly according to the parent component. Then size the parent component."

        "document": "When we enter React development, the transition from HTML to JSX might seem like a major and significant shift. Understanding and using JSX opens a world of benefits for developers. It enhances code readability and provides a bridge between the different worlds of HTML and JavaScript, allowing for a more cohesive and expressive approach to building UI components.\n\nReact has revolutionized the way we build user interfaces, providing a declarative and efficient way to create interactive components. One of the key features that sets React apart is JSX, a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML tags within your regular JavaScript code. This blog will explore the transition from HTML to JSX and how it can supercharge your React development workflow.\n\nGiven below are some topics that we covered in this blog\n\nJSX, or JavaScript XML, is a syntax extension for JavaScript recommended by React. It looks similar to XML/HTML but comes with the full power of regular JavaScript. It enables you to construct components and sections of HTML within your JavaScript code in a natural way. Here's an explanation example given below:\n• None JSX syntax resembles HTML tag, making it easier for developers familiar with HTML to work with React.\n• None JSX allows us to embed JavaScript expressions within curly braces `{}`.\n• None JSX attributes can be written similarly to how we write HTML, using quotes for string values.\n• None A JSX element is treated as an expression in JavaScript, and it can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from functions.\n• None JSX tags can be used within conditional statements and JavaScript expression.\n• None JSX allows us to map over arrays and create lists of elements.\n• None Styles can be applied directly using JavaScript objects in JSX.\n• None JSX allows you to attach event handlers easily.\n• None Comments in JSX are similar to JavaScript block comments and are wrapped in curly braces.\n\nThe JSX needs to be transpired to standard JavaScript before it can be executed in the browser. Tools like Babel are commonly used for this purpose when working with React projects.\n• None Arrow functions can be used for concise JavaScript function expressions, especially when defining event handlers or functional components.\n• None Destructuring can be employed to extract values from objects or arrays easily, improving code readability.\n• None Template literals can be used for string interpolation within JSX expressions.\n• None The spread operator (`...`) can be utilized to merge props or html elements easily.\n• None ES6 class syntax can be used for defining React components.\n• None Import and export statements can be used to modularize your JavaScript code and manage dependencies.\n• None Default parameters can be employed in function components for more robust code.\n• None Readability\n\nJSX makes your code more readable. It closely resembles the HTML structure, making it easier for developers to understand the component's structure at a glance.\n• None JavaScript Expressions\n\nJSX allows embedding JavaScript expressions within curly braces `{}`. This enables dynamic content and logical operations directly within your components.\n• None Components and Reusability\n\nJSX allows you to create reusable components easily. You can compose complex UIs by combining smaller, manageable components.\n• None Code Maintainability\n\nJSX makes it easier to understand the React component structure, leading to improved code maintainability. The visual similarity to HTML aids in quickly grasping the UI representation.\n• None One-Way Data Binding\n\nJSX supports one-way data binding, meaning that the UI is a reflection of the application state. When the state changes, React efficiently updates the corresponding parts of the DOM, simplifying the synchronization between the UI and the application state.\n• None Efficient DOM Updates\n\nReact, in combination with JSX, employs a virtual DOM to optimize updates. It calculates the difference between the current and previous states and only updates the necessary parts of the DOM, leading to improved performance.\n• None Static Analysis\n\nJSX can be statically analyzed by tools like Babel, enabling early error detection. This helps catch issues at compile time rather than runtime, providing a more robust development process.\n• None Enhanced Developer Experience\n\nWriting JSX feels more natural for developers working on user interfaces, as it provides a declarative and component-based syntax that aligns well with the structure of UI elements.\n• None Conciseness\n\nJSX allows developers to express complex UI structures more concisely than using pure JavaScript. It reduces the verbosity often associated with manipulating the DOM through vanilla JavaScript.\n• None Tooling Support\n\nJSX is supported by a variety of tools and editors, providing syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and other features that enhance the development experience.\n\nConverting your existing HTML code to JSX is a straightforward process. Here are some key points to keep in mind:\n• None Class vs. ClassName\n\nWhen defining CSS classes in JSX, className should be used rather than class. This is due to the fact that class in JavaScript is a reserved keyword.\n• None Inline Styles\n\nWhile inline styles in HTML use the style attribute, JSX uses an object to define styles. For example\n\nIn JSX, self-closing tags must end with a slash. For example:\n\nQ1: What is JSX, and how does it differ from HTML in React?\n\nJSX, or JavaScript XML, is a syntax extension for JavaScript often used with React. It looks similar to XML or HTML but allows embedding regular JavaScript expressions within curly braces. JSX is a more concise and expressive way to define React elements compared to using plain HTML. It gets transpiled into JavaScript by tools like Babel before being executed in the browser.\n\nQ2: Can JSX be used outside of React?\n\nWhile JSX is most commonly associated with React elements, it is not limited to React applications. JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript and can be used with other frameworks or libraries or even in standalone JavaScript projects. However, its usage is most prevalent in the React ecosystem.\n\nQ3: How does JSX handle HTML entities and special characters?\n\nJSX handles HTML entities and special characters similarly to HTML. You can use the standard HTML entity syntax within curly braces.\n\nQ4: Are there any performance considerations when using JSX?\n\nIn terms of performance, JSX is optimized by React to have a similar performance profile as manually writing React.createElement calls. The real performance gains come from using JSX in conjunction with React's virtual DOM and reconciliation algorithm, which minimizes the need to update the entire DOM on every change.\n\nQ5: Can I use JavaScript logic directly within JSX?\n\nIt is possible to include logic and JavaScript expressions inside curly braces using JSX. This capability makes it easy to execute dynamic logic, such as conditional statements or mapping over arrays, directly within your JSX code.\n\nQ6: How can I transition an existing HTML-based React project to JSX?\n\nTransitioning from HTML to JSX can be done incrementally. Start by converting small components or sections of your project to JSX. Update your build configuration to support JSX (Babel is commonly used), and gradually refactor existing code. It's essential to test thoroughly during the transition to ensure that functionality is maintained.\n\nQ7: Are there any best practices for writing JSX code?\n\nSome best practices include using consistent indentation, breaking lines for readability, using meaningful React variable and component names, and keeping JSX expressions concise. Additionally, consider modularizing your components for better maintainability.\n\nQ8: Can JSX be written directly in a JavaScript file, or do I need a separate file extension?\n\nJSX can be written directly in a JavaScript file with a .js extension. However, to indicate that a file contains JSX, it's common to use the .jsx extension. Build tools like Babel are configured to recognize and transpile JSX code within .js or .jsx separate files.\n\nQ9: How does JSX handle inline styles and CSS classes?\n\nJSX allows you to define inline styles using JavaScript objects. For CSS classes, you use the className attribute instead of class to avoid conflicts with JavaScript's class keyword.\n\nQ10: Are there any limitations or things to be cautious about when using JSX?\n\nWhile JSX is a powerful tool, developers should be cautious about embedding complex logic directly within JSX, as it might reduce code readability. Additionally, understanding how JSX gets transpiled into JavaScript can help avoid potential pitfalls, such as unintentional object creation in loops.\n\nExplanation: JSX syntax resembles HTML but is a syntactic sugar for React.createElement calls. It makes component creation more readable and concise.\n\nExplanation: JSX allows embedding JavaScript expressions within curly braces, enabling dynamic content generation directly within the markup.\n\nExplanation: JSX facilitates the easy integration of conditional statements, enhancing the dynamic rendering of content based on variable values.\n\nExplanation: JSX promotes the creation of reusable components, fostering a modular and maintainable code structure.\n\nExplanation: JSX seamlessly integrates with JavaScript functions, allowing developers to perform calculations and execute logic within the markup.\n\nExplanation: JSX is used to define the structure of React components, enhancing readability and making component creation more straightforward.\n\nExample 7: Props and State Usage in React Components\n\nTransitioning from HTML to JSX is a natural evolution when working with React. JSX not only enhances the readability of your code but also provides powerful features for building robust and maintainable applications. As we embrace JSX in our React development workflow, we'll find ourselves leveraging its flexibility and efficiency to create dynamic and scalable user interfaces."

        "document": "Quick Summary :- Imagine HTML to ReactJS conversion as leveling up your gaming character. As if you are gaining new powers and abilities, turning your HTML website into a React JS gives you powerful features. Your static HTML pages turn into dynamic components. Your website becomes super powerful with state management. You build reusable pieces that snap together perfectly like assembling building blocks. In this guide, we will take you through how to convert HTML to ReactJS and be yet another step closer to creating that web app faster and as easily scalable as possible.\n\nIs your HTML website as useful as a flip phone in the age of smartphones? You are not alone. Many developers are stuck with the static HTML and want more dynamic possibilities. Turning your HTML website to ReactJS is like upgrading your online existence from a lowly bicycle to a high-powered motorcycle.\n\nMoving from HTML to ReactJS is the ticket to the world of components, good state management, and fast action on the interface. No matter if you’re in charge of growing a business website or modernizing a legacy application, this will change the way you build and maintain web applications. Well, in this article, we see how to make our static HTML pages work with the React dynamic world.\n\nEarlier, web development has been based on HTML, but digital needs are different today. Conversion of HTML to React is an architectural shift in web development. By transforming, we can solve the complexity of modern web applications and increase development efficiency.\n\nThe benefits of this shift are:\n\nWith ReactJS component-based architecture, you can convert your user interface elements to reusable components so that you don’t need to write the same code again and again for multiple applications.\n\nReactJS has great performance benefits by using the virtual DOM implementation. It helps reduce the number of web page refreshes and rendering to help out on user experience.\n\nReactJS is a solid base on which to build. It works with complex applications while ensuring code quality and team collaboration.\n\nWho Can Benefit From This Guide?\n\nIn terms of the strategic advantage, it benefits different segments with the transition from the HTML website to ReactJS.\n\nDevelopment Professionals: Learn how to develop technical skills in ReactJS. You can use Visual Studio to create complex state-oriented applications to fit the modern world and the expectations of the customers.\n\nBusiness Decision-Makers: Develop a technology that delivers business value. ReactJS enhances user engagement, decreases software development cycle time, and lowers maintenance costs.\n\nDevelopment Teams: Revamp your HTML infrastructures. ReactJS gives us an efficient way to build web apps that scale with your growth.\n\nPreparation Before Converting your HTML Website to ReactJS\n\nConverting HTML to ReactJS involves a lot of planning and thinking. In this phase, we build a solid foundation for a successful transformation; it guarantees that your application maintains functionality while acquiring ReactJS powers. The correct preparation will prevent potential issues and reduce software development time.\n\nIt is the cornerstone of a successful conversion — to analyze your current HTML structure in its entirety. Through this, we find what opportunities for optimization and what may pose challenges in the HTML to React transition.\n\nHTML Structure: You need to do an extensive audit of your website architecture. Pay special attention to the header, footer, and navigation, which should be converted into the React components.\n\nScripts: Evaluate the usage of JavaScript code snippets and its related libraries. Identify document scripts that need to be refactored into React compatible solutions, or replaced with modern React patterns.\n\nStyles: Check on CSS architecture for a component’s compatibility. If you are in the React ecosystem it is beneficial to switch to CSS modules or styled components for better maintainability.\n\nThe backbone of efficient ReactJS applications is Strategic component architecture. Develop a systematic component plan to use.\n\nDecide on State Management: Analyze data flow requirements to realize appropriate state management solutions, such as React’s native Context API, or payment provider specific, e.g. Redux.\n\nSet up an infrastructure for professional development to facilitate the conversion to ReactJS:\n• None Go to Node.js Official Website and download and install Node.js.\n• None Node.js has npm integrated into its system and uses npm to manage packages such as React.\n• None Among the most used codes is Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and it has extensions that support ReactJS.\n• None Start with a quick setup using the Create React App.\n• None This is done by creating a new folder called my-react-app by running the following command from the command line.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a faster development lightweight bundler such as Vite.\n• None To maintain the version and for collaboration, initialize Git.\n\nThere are a few ways to convert your HTML website to ReactJS, and they stem from a systematic and methodical method. In this section, we will outline what you need to do to migrate from a static HTML structure into a dynamic React application. This entails that each phase created is built on from the previous phase so that the transition is done successfully with minimal disruption.\n\nYou start with project initialization which is the foundation of your HTML to React conversion. Select the appropriate build tool based on your project requirements:\n\nUsing Create React App: React Create app provides React development with a robust start-up point.\n\nIt will set up a full-fledged React application with all the required configurations.\n\nUsing Vite (Faster Alternative): Vite is a good tool for enhanced development performance.\n\nStructuring the directory structure of React applications will ensure that we end up with code that is maintainable and scalable.\n\nJSX helps you to connect HTML code and React components. The essential transformations are\n\nThis is where we take the monolithic HTML code and split it into separate React components making it easier to manage and reuse.\n\nIf you are moving from an HTML website to ReactJS, you need to know how to manage assets and style them strategically.\n\nUsing React’s state management and props system, take full advantage of Dynamic functionality.\n• None Always test the website on several browsers.\n• None Check React components by using Jest or React Testing Library\n\nUsing this systematic procedure, get code with quality and performance standards. It adds each step on top of each other to create a solid react application with modern development standards.\n\nBest Practices for a Smooth HTML to ReactJS Transition\n\nDevelopment standards must be followed when migrating from an HTML website to ReactJS. These are the React best practices that optimize performance so that as far as maintenance and scalability are concerned, they serve it best. These guidelines make it possible to implement and smoothly adopt these guidelines so that one can enjoy the full React ecosystem benefits.\n\nThe HTML to React conversion process is built on a cornerstone principle, the concept of React component reusability. React Components can be used to enhance code quality and speed up the development process.\n\nUse standardized React components for everything you have in your application.\n\nDivide large parts into subparts that are specific and less time-consuming. This method improves code maintenance and also promotes the reuse of that code across your application.\n\nFor React-built applications, the optimization of performance is still important. These strategies are put in place to enhance the performance of the application.\n\nLazy Loading Components: Load React components only when they are needed to reduce the initial load time. Use React’s lazy() and Suspense.\n\nMinimize Re-renders: Avoid unnecessary re-renders by using React.memo for functional React components\n\nUse Key Attributes Wisely: Always use unique key attributes when rendering lists to help React identify which items have changed.\n\nOpt for up-to-date image formats andLazy Loading technique.

        "document": "React is an open-source frontend JavaScript framework that allows developers to create user interfaces using UI components and single-page applications. Routing is one of the most important features we always want to implement when developing these applications.\n\nRouting redirects users to different pages based on their actions or requests. In React routing, you'll use an external library called React router, which can be challenging to configure if you need help understanding how it works.\n\nIn this article, we will show you how to perform routing in React using a React router. Learn the various routing aspects and how React router handles them, such as dynamic routing, programmatic navigation, no-matching routes, etc.\n\nTo fully comprehend and follow this guide, we would create an application that properly illustrates all aspects of navigation with appropriate use cases. We would create/use a cocktails app that retrieves data from Hygraph via GraphQL. This application, which can be accessed via this live link, uses all aspects of routing covered in this guide.\n\nYou should have the following to follow along with this guide and code:\n• Some experience or knowledge of React\n• Node and npm or yarn installed on your machine\n\nAs previously stated, React makes use of an external library to handle routing; however, before we can implement routing with that library, we must first install it in our project, which is accomplished by running the following command in your terminal (within your project directory):\n\nAfter successfully installing the package, we can set up and configure the React router for our project.\n\nTo configure React router, navigate to the file, which is the root file, and import from the package that we installed, wrapping it around our App component as follows:\n\n# How to configure routes in React\n\nWe have now successfully installed and imported React router into our project; the next step is to use React router to implement routing. The first step is configuring all of our routes (all the pages/components we want to navigate).\n\nWe would first create those components, in our case, three pages: the Home page, the About Page, and the Products Page. This GitHub repository contains the content for these pages. Once those pages are properly configured, we can now set up and configure our routes in the file, which serves as the foundation for our React application:\n\nWe can see in the above code that we imported and components from and then used them to declare the routes we want. All Routes are wrapped in the tag, and these Routes have two major properties:\n• None : As the name implies, this identifies the path we want users to take to reach the set component. When we set the to , for example, when the user adds to the URL link, it navigates to that page.\n• None : This contains the component that we want the set path to load. This is simple to understand, but remember to import any components we are using here, or else an error will occur.\n\nWhen we go to our browser and try to navigate via the URL, it will load whatever content we have on such pages.\n\nLet us now create a standard Navigation bar component that can be used to navigate inside our application.\n\nThe component from react-router-dom is a special component that helps you navigate different routes using the prop. component also knows whether the route is currently \"active\" and adds a default class to the link. We can use this class in our CSS to define some styling for active links, as shown below:\n\nAlso, we can assign our custom classes instead of using the default active class. The NavLink component gives us access to properties like isActive, which can be used like this.\n\nFinally, let us use the Navbar component inside our App.\n\nHow to fix No Routes Found Error\n\nWhen routing, a situation may cause a user to access an unconfigured route or a route that does not exist; when this occurs, React does not display anything on the screen except a warning with the message \"No routes matched location.\"\n\nThis can be fixed by configuring a new route to return a specific component when a user navigates to an unconfigured route as follows:\n\nIn the preceding code, we created a route with the path to get all non-configured paths and assign them to the attached component.\n\n# How to navigate programmatically in React\n\nProgrammatic navigation is the process of navigating/redirecting a user as a result of an action on a route, such as a login or a signup action, order success, or when he clicks on a back button.\n\nLet's first look at how we can redirect to a page when an action occurs, such as when a button is clicked. We accomplish this by adding an event, but first, we must create the route in our file. After that, we can import the hook from the and use it to navigate programmatically as follows:\n\nEnsure you already have the hook imported and instantiated as we did earlier else this won’t work.\n\n# How to implement dynamic routing with React router\n\nWe created three files in our pages folder earlier to implement routing, one of which was the products component, which we will populate with Hygraph content. We created a schema in Hygraph to receive cocktail details, and this is how it looks:\n\nWe then filled it in with cocktail specifics. We will now use GraphQL to retrieve these data so that we can consume them in our React project. This is how the products page appears:We fetched our content from Hygraph in the preceding code; if you already created your own schema, you can simply change the Endpoint URL and possibly the schema name if you gave it a different name.\n\nWe added a and used string interpolation to dynamically attach the of each product to the path, so we can get the and use it to get the data to show.\n\nLet us now put dynamic routing into action.\n\nThe first step would be to create the component that we want to render dynamically, and for that we would create a file where we would dynamically fetch details of each product based on the passed through the URL, but for now we can just place dummy data into the component like this:\n\nWe can now proceed to create a route to handle dynamic routing in our file this way:\n\nSo far, we've dealt with the first part of dynamic routing. We must now obtain the parameter passed through the URL in order to dynamically query the data for the specific cocktail. This will be accomplished through the use of .\n\nHow to use URL params to handle dynamic routing\n\nWe will import the hook into the component so that we can use it to get the URL parameter and then use that parameter to query our data from Hygraph via GraphQL.\n\nAt this point, we have successfully been able to get the URL param passed, let’s now make use of this slug to fetch data from Hygraph using GraphQL:\n\n# How to implement lazy loading with React router\n\nAt this point, we have successfully implemented dynamic routing.\n\nWe've already seen how to create routes and implement routing with React router; now let's look at how to lazy load routes with React router.\n\nLazy loading is a technique in which components that are not required on the home page are not loaded until a user navigates to that page, allowing our application to load faster than having to wait for the entire app to load at once. This contributes to improved performance, which leads to a positive user experience.\n\nTo implement lazy loading, simply go to and wrap our routes with the component, along with a props that are rendered on the screen until the component loads:\n\nWe learned about routing and how to implement it in our React application in this guide. It is critical to understand that the React router is what allows us to perform single-page routing without reloading the application."
