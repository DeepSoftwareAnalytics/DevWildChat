The two options are cross validation \"CV\" and \"EBIC\" (default). While cross-validation (CV) is used in the paper (see below), the Extended Bayesian Information Criterion (EBIC, see Barber et al., 2015) is a useful alternative in cases where the CV requirement that all categories are present in each fold is not met or in cases where CV is computationally unfeasible.\n\nThe number of folds to be used for cross-validation in case .

The \"OR\"-rule determines conditional dependence if at least one of the two parameters is non-zero, the \"AND\"-rule determines conditional dependence if both parameters are non-zero.\n\nFor each neighborhood regression, uses the appropriate link function for each variable type. uses linear regression for each variable, no matter of which type it is (for categorical variables, this method predicts each indicator variable using linear regression).\n\nHandling of missing values. The default returns an error message in case there are missing data. sets the weight of missing cases to zero. For stationary graphs, this is the equivalent to casewise deletion. In time varying graphs, this avoids corruption of the time scale, which would be the consequence of casewise deletion. For details, please see Haslbeck and Waldorp (2015)."

The two options are cross validation \"CV\" and the Extended Bayesian Information Criterion (EBIC) \"EBIC\". The EBIC performs well in selecting sparse graphs (see Barber and Drton, 2010 and Foygel and Drton, 2014). Note that when also searching the alpha parameter in the elastic net penalty, cross validation should be preferred, as the parameter vector will not necessarily be sparse anymore. The EBIC tends to be a bit more conservative than CV (see Haslbeck and Waldorp, 2016). CV can sometimes not be performed with categorical variables, because requires at least 2 events of each category of each categorical variable in each training-fold.

Defaults to .\n\nOrder up until including which interactions are included in the model. means that all pairwise interactions are included, means that all pairwise and all three-way interactions are included, etc. In previous versions of mgm the order of interactions was specified by the parameter d, the largest size or a neighborhood. Note that k = d + 1.\n\nInteger vector with elements in , specifying moderation effects to be included in the model. For instance, includes all linear moderation effects of variable 4. This is equivalent to including all 3-way interactions that include variable 4. Note that gives the same model as setting (see previous argument). Alternatively, a specific set of moderators can be specified via a M x 3 matrix, where M is the number of moderation effects. For example, adds (only) the 3-way interaction 1-2-3 to the model.\n\nRule used to combine estimates from neighborhood regression. E.g. for pairwise interactions, two estimates (one from regressing A on B and one from B on A) have to combined in one edge parameter. requires all estimates to be nonzero in order to set the edge to be present. requires at least one estiamte to be nonzero in order to set the edge to be present. For higher order interactions, estimate have to be combined with this rule.\n\nA threshold below which edge-weights are put to zero. This is done in order to guarantee a lower bound on the false-positive rate. refers to the threshold in Loh and Wainwright (2013), which was used in all previous versions of mgm. refers to the threshold in Haslbeck and Waldorp (2016). If no thresholding is applied. Defaults to .\n\nIf , a sign for the interaction within binary nodes and between binary and continuous nodes is provided in the output. Note that in this case the two categories of the binary variables have to be coded in 0,1. This is to ensure that the interpretation of the sign is unambigous: a positive sign of a parameter means that increasing the associated predictor results in a higher probability for category 1.\n\nIf , uses over-parameterized design-matrices for each neighborhood regression; this means that an interaction between two categorical variables with m and s categories is parameterized by m*s parameters. If the standard parameterization (in ) with m*(s-1) parameters is used, where the first category of the predicting variable serves as reference category. If all variables are continuous both parameterizations are the same. Note that the default is set to , to be consistent with the previous mgm versions. However when the goal is to seperate pairwise interactions from 3-way (or higher) interactions, then the overparameterized version is advantageous. See the examples below for an illustration. Note that we can estimate the model despite the colinear columns in the design matrix because we use penalized regression."

It is a list in which the first entry corresponds to 2-way interactions, the second entry corresponds to 3-way interactions, etc. and the kth entry to the k+1-way interaction. Each entry contains a matrix with dimensions order x number of interaction of given order. Each row in the matrix indicates an interaction, e.g. (1, 3, 7, 9) in the matrix in list entry three indicates a 4-way interaction between the variables 1, 3, 7 and 9. This object specifies the parameters associated to the interactions specified in . Corresponding to the structure in , this object is a list, where the kth entry corresponds to k+1-way interactions. Each list entry contains another list, with entries equal to the number of rows in the corresponding matrix in . Each of these list entries (for a fixed k) contains a k-dimensional array that specifies the parameters of the given k-order interaction. For instance, if we have a 3-way interaction (1, 2, 3) and all variables are binary, we have a 2 x 2 x 2 array specifiying the parameters for each of the 2^3 = 8 possible configurations. If all variables are continuous, we have a 1 x 1 x 1 array, so the interaction is specified by a single parameter. See the examples below for an illustration.

Note that the contraints on the parameter space necessary to ensure that the joint distribution is normalizable are to our best knowledge unknown. Yang and colleagues (2014) give these constraints for a number of simple pairwise models. In practice, an \"improper joint density\" will lead to a sampling process that approaches infinity, and hence will return / values."
