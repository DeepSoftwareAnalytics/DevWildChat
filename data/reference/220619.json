This article will explore various ways to take multiple inputs from the user in Python.\n\nOne of the simplest ways to take multiple inputs from a user in Python is by using the input() function along with the split() method. The split() method splits a string into a list based on a specified separator (by default, it uses whitespace).\n• .split() divides the string into separate components based on whitespace by default.\n• None The values are assigned to individual variables (x, y, z).\n\nLet’s take a look at other cases of taking multiple inputs from user in python:\n\nUsing List Comprehension (Multiple Inputs in One Line\n\nIf we want to ask the user for multiple values on a single line, we can use list comprehension combined with the input() function and split() to break the input into individual components. Also we can take inputs separated by custom delimiter which is comma in the below example.\n• input() function is used to take the user’s input as a string.\n• split() method splits the string based on whitespace (by default) into a list of strings.\n• [item for item in input().split()] takes each element in the split input and stores it in the list inputs.\n\nIf you need to collect multiple inputs in a single line and convert them into integers (or another data type), the map() function is useful. The map() function applies a specified function to each item in an iterable.\n• None to take a single line of input.\n• None method divides the string into a list of substrings.\n• None converts each element in the list to an integer.\n• None Finally, we convert the result back into a list to display the values.\n\nIf you want to collect multiple inputs from the user one at a time, you can use a loop. This is particularly useful when you need to collect an arbitrary number of inputs or perform validation on each input.\n• None We first ask how many items the user wants to input.\n• None We then use a loop to take inputs one by one, appending each input to a list.\n• None After the loop finishes, we print the collected items.\n• None This approach gives the user the flexibility to enter as many items as needed.\n\nHow to Take Multiple Inputs in Python?\n\nHow to Use\n\nHow to Split User Input in Python?\n\nYou can split the user input using the method.

        "document": "Python function generates the immutable sequence of numbers starting from the given start integer to the stop integer. The is a built-in function that returns a range object that consists series of integer numbers, which we can iterate using a loop.\n\nIn Python, Using a for loop with , we can repeat an action a specific number of times. For example, let’s see how to use the function of Python 3 to produce the first six numbers.\n\nNote: As you can see in the output, We got six integers starting from 0 to 5. If you notice, didn’t include 6 in its result because it generates numbers up to the stop number but never includes the stop number in its result.\n\nThe works differently between Python 3 and Python 2.\n• In Python 2, we have and functions to produce a sequence of numbers.\n• In Python 3 is renamed to and original function was removed. We will discuss it in the later section of the article.\n\nHow to use range() function in Python\n\nBelow is the syntax of the range() function.\n\nIt takes three arguments. Out of the three, two are optional. The and are optional arguments and the is the mandatory argument.\n• : (Lower limit) It is the starting position of the sequence. The default value is 0 if not specified. For example, . Here, and\n• : (Upper limit) generate numbers up to this number, i.e., An integer number specifying at which position to stop (upper limit). The never includes the stop number in its result\n• : Specify the increment value. Each next number in the sequence is generated by adding the step value to a preceding number. The default value is 1 if not specified. It is nothing but a difference between each number in the result. For example, . Here, .\n\nIt returns the object of class .\n\nNow, let’s see all the possible scenarios. Below are the three variants of .\n\nWhen you pass only one argument to the , it will generate a sequence of integers starting from 0 to .\n• Here, and as a default value.\n• If you set the as a 0 or some negative value, then the range will return an empty sequence.\n• If you want to start the range at 1 use .\n\nWhen you pass two arguments to the , it will generate integers starting from the number to .\n• Here, the as a default value.\n• The range will return an empty sequence if you set the value lesser than the .\n\nWhen you pass all three arguments to the range(), it will return a sequence of numbers, starting from the start number, increments by step number, and stops before a stop number.\n\nHere you can specify a different increment by adding a parameter.\n• Here, the as a default value.\n• Python will raise a exception if you set the to 0.\n• The function only works with the integers, So all arguments must be integers. You can not use float numbers or any other data type as a start, stop, and step value. Please refer to generate a range of float numbers in Python\n• All three arguments can be positive or negative.\n• The value must not be zero. If a , Python will raise a exception.\n\nPython for loop executes a block of code or statement repeatedly for a fixed number of times. We can iterate over a sequence of numbers produced by the range() function using for loop.\n\nLet’s see how to use loop with function to print the odd numbers between 1 and 10. Using this example, we can understand how the iterator variable is getting value when we use range() with for loop.\n\nTo understand what means in Python, we need first to understand the working of the function.\n\nThe function uses the generator to produce numbers. It doesn’t generate all numbers at once.\n\nAs you know range() returns the object. A range object uses the same (small) amount of memory, no matter the size of the range it represents. It only stores the start, stop and step values and calculates individual items and subranges as needed.\n\nI.e., It generates the next value only when for loop iteration asked for it. In each loop iteration, It generates the next value and assigns it to the iterator variable i.\n• As you can see in the output, the variable is not getting the values 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 simultaneously.\n• In the first iteration of the loop value of is the start number of a range.\n• Next, In every subsequent iteration of for loop, the value of is incremented by the step value. The value of is determined by the formula .\n\nSo it means range() produces numbers one by one as the loop moves to the next iteration. It saves lots of memory, which makes range() faster and more efficient.\n\nYou can iterate Python sequence types such as list and string using a and for loop.\n\nWhen you iterate the list only using a loop, you can access only items. When you iterate the list only using a loop, you can only access its items, but when you use range() along with the loop, you can access the index number of each item.\n\nThe advantage of using to iterate a list is that it allows us to access each item’s index number. Using index numbers, we can access as well as modify list items if required.\n\nPass the count of total list items to using a function. The will use it as a argument.\n\nYou can display the sequence of numbers produced by a function by descending order or reverse order.\n\nYou can use the following two ways to get the reverse range of numbers in Python.\n\nUse a negative step value in a function to generate the sequence of numbers in reverse order. For example, will produce numbers like 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1.\n\nI.e., you can reverse a loop by setting the step argument of a to -1. It will cause the loop to iterate in reverse order.\n\nLet’s see how to loop in a reverse iteration or backward iteration to display a range of numbers from 5 to 0.\n\nUsing Python’s built-in function, you can reverse any sequence such as list or range.\n• Pass the as an input to the reversed() function, It returns a that accesses the sequence of numbers provided by in the reverse order.\n• Next, iterate the result provided by function using for loop.\n\nExample 2: reverse range starting from 20 to 10\n\nExample 3: reverse range starting from 20 to 10 with step 2\n\nNote: The returns a that accesses the sequence of numbers provided by in the reverse order.\n\nAlso, If you need the list out of it, you need to convert the output of the function to list. So you can get the reverse list of ranges.\n\nUse to reverse a list by passing the count of list items as a argument and as a -1.\n\nLet’s see the various ways to reverse a list of numbers using a\n\nA step is an optional argument of a range(). It is an integer number that determines the increment between each number in the sequence. i.e., It specifies the incrementation.\n\nYou can also define it as a difference between each preceding and next number in the result sequence. For example, If the step is 2, then the difference between each preceding and following number is 2\n\nThe default value of the step is 1 if not specified explicitly.\n\nYou can also perform lots of operations by using step arguments such as reverse a sequence such as a list and string.\n\nYou can decrement range() by using negative value.\n\nWhen we set the negative value to step, In each iteration, the number will go down until it reaches to stop number.\n\nNote: To decrement the must be greater than . A range() return empty sequence if .\n\nAlso, you can use to generate sequence of numbers multiply of n.\n\nAlso, you will get a if you set .\n\nAlso, you can’t use the decimal value. If you want to use the float/decimal step in the , please refer to generating a range of float numbers.\n\nYou can use negative integers in range().\n\nMost of the time, we use the negative step value to reverse a range. But apart from the step, we can use negative values in the other two arguments (start and stop) of a range() function.\n\nExample: Negative range from -1 to -10\n\nLet’s see the example to print the range of numbers from negative to positive.\n\nLet’s understand the above program, we set –\n• In the 1st iteration of the loop, is -1\n• In the 2nd iteration of for loop, is -2 because , and it will repeat this process till the stop number.\n\nExample: Negative reverse range from -10 to -1\n\nYou can also print the negative reverse using a positive integer.\n\nPython function doesn’t return a type. It returns an immutable sequence of integers.\n\nWe can convert to list using a constructor.\n• Pass the function as an input to the list constructor.\n• The constructor automatically creates a list by enclosing the integers returned by the inside the square brackets.\n\nAlso, you can use to access and modify items.\n• Using a function, you can get a count of list items.\n• Next, use this count as a stop number in and iterate for loop times.\n• In each iteration, you will get the index number of a current list item.\n\nIn this section, we will learn how to generate an inclusive range in Python. By default, The is exclusive, so it doesn’t include the last number in the result. It creates the sequence of numbers from to .\n\nFor example, will produce . The result contains numbers from 0 to up to 5 but not five.\n\nIf you notice, the result contains 5 elements which equal to . Note, the index always starts from 0, not 1.\n\nIf you want to include the end number in the result, i.e., If you want to create an inclusive range, then set the stop argument value as .\n\nThe vs comparison is relevant only if you are using Python 2 and Python 3. If you are not using Python 2 you can skip this comparison.\n\nThe range() function works differently between Python 3 and Python 2. If your application runs on both Python 2 and Python 3, you must use instead of for better code compatibility.\n\nIn Python 2, we have and functions to produce a sequence of numbers.\n\nIn Python 3 is renamed to and original function was removed.\n\nSo in simple terms, is removed from Python 3, and we can use only the function to produce the numbers within a given range.\n\nUse of and\n• In Python 2, returns the object, i.e., It does generate all numbers at once. The will generate a Python list of 499 integers in memory. So It consumes high memory and increases the execution time.\n• : The function doesn’t generate all numbers at once. It produces numbers one by one as the loop moves to the next number. So it consumes less memory and resources.\n\nConcatenating the result of two range()\n\nLet say you want to add . And you want the concatenated range like .\n\nFor example, you want to add the result of two functions to produce another sequence of numbers. You can add/merge the result of multiple functions using .\n\nBuilt-in function is the constructor that returns a object, this range object can also be accessed by its index number using indexing and slicing.\n\nIt is essential to know the attributes when you receive it as input to your function, and you wanted to see the value of the , and argument.\n\nsupports both positive and negative indices. The below example demonstrates the same.\n\nIn the case of , The index value starts from zero to (stop). For example, if you want to access the 3rd number, we need to use 2 as the index number.\n\nThe numbers can be accessed from right to left by using negative indexing.\n\nIs there a way to print a range of characters or alphabets? For example like this.\n\nIs there a way to print a range of characters or alphabets? For example like this. It is possible to create a range of characters using the custom generator. Let’s see how to generate the ‘a’ to ‘z’ alphabet using the custom function.\n\nNote: We need to use the ASCII value and then convert the ASCII value to a letter using a function.\n\nI want to hear from you.

        "document": "The function is an incredibly useful built-in function in Python that allows you to generate a sequence of integers to loop over in loops. By leveraging , you can precisely control the number of iterations in your loops, making your code more efficient, scalable, and maintainable.\n\nIn this comprehensive guide, you will learn:\n\nWhat is the range() Function in Python?\n\nThe function generates a sequence of integers based on the start, stop, and step arguments provided. It returns a object that represents an immutable sequence of numbers which is efficient to iterate over in loops.\n\nHere is the basic syntax for :\n• - Starting number of the sequence (default is 0)\n• - Generate numbers up to, but not including this number\n• - Difference between each number in the sequence (default is 1)\n\nCalling with just the stop value will give you a sequence from 0 to up to but not including the provided stop:\n\nThis allows you to iterate exactly 5 times. The object creates the sequence of numbers on demand instead of allocating the full sequence in memory at once like a list. This makes it very efficient for large sequences.\n\nNow let’s look at how we can control iterations using in loops.\n\nUsing range() in for Loops\n\nThe function pairs perfectly with loops to iterate a specific number of times. The integer sequence generated by can be looped over directly:\n\nThis will print “Iteration 0” through “Iteration 9” for exactly 10 iterations controlled by .\n\nWe can also specify a start, stop, and step size for more control:\n\nThis will print the odd numbers between 5 and 15, iterating only 5 times.\n\nThe key advantage is lets you control iterations statefully and programmatically. You can calculate stop values or steps based on application logic vs hard coding iterations.\n\nLet’s explore more range() patterns and techniques for for loop control.\n\nSpecifying Start, Stop, and Step Values with range()\n\nThe flexibility of passing start, stop, and step arguments to allows us to precisely control iterations.\n\nThis is the simplest way to use by passing just the start and stop values:\n\nThis will print integers from 1 up to but not including 10. Great for looping a set number of times.\n\nAdding a step or stride controls the interval between numbers:\n\nThis iterates 0, 5, 10, 15 by skipping 5 each loop. This is useful for iterating at a fixed interval.\n\nThis counts down from 10 to 1, great for controlled backwards iteration.\n\nYou can specify matching start and stop values to create a range with just one item:\n\nThis will only print 5 once, acting as initialization.\n\nCalling with no arguments will create an infinite sequence from 0, allowing you to iterate forever:\n\nUse Ctrl+C to stop this safely. Useful for repeatedly executing code in loops.\n\nThere are many possible patterns by combining start, stop, and step values when using for for loop control and iteration.\n\nIterating Over a Sequence with Index Using range()\n\nA common need is iterating over a sequence and accessing the index value at each iteration.\n\nUsing and together allows you to safely iterate with indexes:\n\nThis idiom is commonly used with lists, tuples, dictionaries, and other data structures in Python.\n\nThe key benefit is will iterate the correct number of times regardless of the length of the sequence. It avoids potential errors like hard coding a set number of iterations.\n\nLet’s look at some common use cases and examples for using in loops for iteration control.\n\nUse when you need to repeat an action a set number of times:\n\nThis repeats the print statement 5 times without needing a counter variable.\n\nYou can iterate over a sequence and modify it:\n\nThis multiplies each item in the list by 10 programmatically.\n\nUse to loop at a fixed interval regardless of sequence size:\n\nThis will print just the even indexed items spacing the iteration.\n\nThe range handles the controlled backward iteration from 10 down to 1. Great for timers and clocks.\n\nThese are just a few examples of how can provide programmatic control over loop iterations for many different use cases.\n\nA common need is to iterate in reverse order, which can be done cleanly using and a negative step value.\n\nFor example, to print a list in reverse order:\n\nSetting range from the last index down to 0 with a step of -1 reverses the iteration order.\n\nWe can also reverse any sequence using:\n\nThis simple pattern allows reversing iterations easily with .\n\nWhen using for controlled iteration, be mindful how start, stop, and step values are specified to properly increment or decrement the sequence.\n\nTo loop from 0 to n, use:\n\nTo increment from a to b, use:\n\nTo loop from n down to 0, use:\n\nAnd to decrement from b down to a:\n\nHaving the stop value be one less when decrementing avoids off-by-one errors.\n\nGetting these right can take a bit of practice, so always double check your start, stop, and ranges when iterating.\n\nPython includes some built-in functions that work nicely with the object returned by .\n\nTo convert a to a to allow slicing, sorting, etc:\n\nYou can check if a value is within a range quickly using :\n\nChecks if a number exists between the start and stop values.\n\nTo repeat the same value n times in a list, use:\n\nMultiplying a one element list repeats it. Handy with lengths.\n\nThese utilities help broaden what you can do with ranges beyond just iteration.\n\nWhile is straightforward to use, there are some common mistakes and edge cases to be aware of.\n\nIt’s easy to be off-by-one with start, stop, and step values. Double check ranges match expected iteration counts.\n\nCalling without arguments produces an infinite sequence - use caution to avoid infinite loops.\n\nonly works with integer arguments. Floats will raise a .\n\nLarge step values can cause unexpected iteration skips - know your data size vs range offsets.\n\nThe built-in Python function is an indispensable tool for controlling loop iterations.
