ContractSafe stands out as the best choice for its ease of use, affordability, and ability to make contract management refreshingly simple for your entire team.\n\nStill, it's important to explore your options to ensure you're making the right choice for your business. In this contract management software buyer’s guide, we'll walk you through some of the top contract management solutions and highlight their key features, pros, cons, and price points. Read on to find the best option for your team.\n\nManaging contracts doesn't have to be overwhelming, especially with the right solutions to help you stay organized, save time, and reduce stress. But with so many contract management software options out there, how do you know which one is right for your business?\n\nBelow, you'll find 14 of the top contract management systems for 2025 and what makes them unique, highlighting their key features, strengths and potential drawbacks.\n\nHow To Choose the Right Contract Management Software\n\nChoosing the right contract management software for your business can be tough. With so many options, it can be difficult to know where to begin. Here are a few things you should consider:\n• None Software that's hard to use doesn't get used. That's why contract management buyers say ease of use is the most important factor when choosing a tool. Good contract lifecycle management (CLM) platforms are easy to learn. You should be able to find things easily, learn the platform quickly, and make changes at the snap of a finger. It should also be easy for anyone in the organization to use--not just the power users. The more people that use the tool confidently, the more benefit you'll see.\n• None \n\n\n\n Not all businesses need the same features, and that's okay. The best contract management software should do exactly what you need it to do. Knowing what features you need will help you pick a platform that suits your needs without overpaying for the \"bells and whistles\" you’ll never use. Here's how to assess the feature set:\n• None Start with Your Must-Haves: Do you need templates, approval workflows, automated reminders? Make a list of the features that will directly address your team's challenges and ensure the software you choose has them.\n• None Avoid Paying for What You Don't Need: While it's tempting to go for the solution with every imaginable feature, this leads to overspending and underuse. Focus on finding a platform that aligns with your business's current needs while offering scalability for the future.\n• None Implementation: No one wants a huge project and the faster you're up and running, the sooner you're save time and money. Find software that makes the business-critical tools as easy to use as possible to spur adoption and get up and running quickly.\n• None Software should play nice with your current processes and other software essential to your business.\n• None CLM software is either pay-per-contract or pay-per-user. Most businesses prefer pay-per-contract. When more people can use a tool, you get more value faster, which increases saving and efficiency. It also provides more budget certainty and scales more easily with your organization.\n• None Evaluate the software's customer support responsiveness and effectiveness and whether or not your team will have a dedicated success manager throughout the contract.\n\nKeeping these features in mind, let’s dive into the top contact management solutions.\n\nPrice range: Starting at $375/mo with pricing based on the features you need and the number of active contracts in your database.

It is so user friendly, and a very viable option to manage all your contracts and related info. My team is thrilled with the roll out of ContractSafe and happy to be modernized in our contract management.\"\n\nPrice range: Starts from $700/mo for the standard package and goes up to $2,000/mo for premium\n\nContractWorks at a glance: ContractWorks is built for businesses that want more contract drafting capabilities, but it comes with a steep learning curve and relatively higher pricing.\n• None Contract drafting: ContractWorks's drafting features include a live preview feature, in-document editing by any party, and AI-generated definitions for key features. Once the legal team sets it up, anyone can create contracts.\n• None The dashboard is packed with data, which is a boon if you know how to wield it. For the average user, however, it may clog up the key takeaways.\n• None ContractWorks offers e-signature capabilities, though its base plan is restricted to five licenses.\n• None Getting started can be a heavy lift with ContractWorks, but it does offer free support through the process.\n\nWhat customers are saying:\n\n“I felt like this software created a foundation for us to go from a paper process to an electronic process. It created a centralized database for our contracts and we had to reorganize our processes for that. However, some users wanted the next level functions or automated processes.”\n\nCheck out our full comparison of ContractSafe vs. ContractWorks to find the best contract management solution for your needs.\n\nPrice range: CobbleStone does not openly share pricing information on its website.\n\nCobbleStone at a glance: CobbleStone is a robust contract management solution designed with a deep focus on procurement. While its advanced features, such as AI-based contract authoring and OCR data extraction, are impressive, the platform's complex interface and steep learning curve may prove a hurdle for some users.\n• None Designed with procurement in mind, CobbleStone includes many procurement-specific modules that cannot be hidden. If you're not in procurement, these features may feel redundant.\n• None CobbleStone's interface packs a lot of power but requires some time and training to fully exploit its potential.\n• None CobbleStone's base product is heavily inclined toward contract creation, with additional features like contract negotiation and post-signing tools available as paid add-ons.\n• None Dedicated support and implementation services are available, but they come with an extra fee, which could potentially inflate your overall costs.\n\nWhat customers are saying:\n\n\"One of the main difficulties is the interface, which can initially be difficult to use. It can take some time to get used to all the features and functions, and the learning curve for new users can be steep. Additionally, the software can be slow to load, especially when working with larger contract databases, which can hurt productivity. As it can be challenging to derive useful insights from the data, the reporting and analytics features could also use some improvement.\"\n\nPrice range: Concord offers tier pricing starting at $49/mo per user for the \"Essentials\" plan; $79/mo per user for \"Business\"; custom pricing is available for enterprises, Keep in mind, Concord has announced a price increase for 2025.\n\nConcord at a glance: Concord is a contract management solution with a strong focus on contract generation, editing, and electronic signature capabilities. While it has an array of features, the software's functionality can feel overwhelming, unintuitive, and at times glitchy.\n• None Concord offers templates for contract creation and automated approvals, but document formatting often changes during uploading, which can be challenging.\n• None While customer support is available for all tiers, a dedicated customer success manager is only available for the enterprise tier.\n• None Integration and reporting only at higher tiers: No integrations or customized reporting are offered for the standard tier, which could be a significant limitation for some businesses.\n• None In addition to paying per user, Concord buyers say its collaboration features can be challenging to navigate. Plus, setting up user permissions can be time-consuming.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat customers are saying:\n\n“I've found it to be a bit confusing at times and it's slowed down my work. We have a lot of options when it comes to customizing our platform. However, setting it up can take some time. I'm worried that the platform can be slow sometimes. This has made it difficult for me to use it smoothly and efficiently.“\n\nPrice range: Contractbook offers three plans \"Essential\", \"Centralize\" and \"Accelerate\" but does not openly share pricing information on its website.\n\nContractbook at a glance: Contractbook is a contract management software with a primary focus on contract generation. Its sustainability initiative \"Save the Trees\" and integration with numerous other business tools help it stand out from the crowd. However, it struggles with limited reporting tools, opaque pricing, and challenges associated with third-party contracts.\n• None Contractbook comes with robust templates aimed at simplifying contract generation. However, users have reported these templates to be difficult to use.\n• None Contractbook provides the functionality to upload third-party contracts, but some users have found this process to be tricky, adding complexity to the contract management process.\n• None A major downside to Contractbook is its lack of comprehensive reporting tools, which might limit your ability to gain insights from your company's contract data.\n• None A dedicated customer success representative is available during implementation, though how long the rep will help is based on which pricing plan you select.\n\nWhat customers are saying:\n\n“Bugs and stuff that requires manual/extra work, e.g. having to refresh contracts before sending them, pop-ups about using same email twice (even while not doing that), overall lagginess of the page, customers having trouble signing (sometimes requests signing into CB to sign etc.)”\n\nPrice range: Ironclad does not openly share pricing information on its website.\n\nIronclad at a glance: Ironclad offers a ton of features like automated workflows, AI, negotiation features, and a dedicated customer success team, but comes with a steep learning curve and a very high price point.\n• None Ironclad’s collaboration features allow for redlining and revision without forcing counterparties to use the same platform.\n• None This workflow design helps even non-tech-savvy contract managers create processes that will work for them.\n• None Its AI tool helps with contract reviews and flagging unfavorable clauses to the business.\n• None It offers OCR-based search, though not as powerful as some might like. You may find yourself sifting through several irrelevant results to find what you need.\n• None Ironclad's editing and redlining tools are word-based, requiring separate integrations for e-signature tools.\n• None Ironclad's complex logic for setting up workflows and triggers can be a boon for some but a steep learning curve for others.\n• None Expect a lengthier setup process with Ironclad. And while it does offer implementation support, you'll need to pay a premium for additional help.\n• Unlimited users: Ironclad offers unlimited users, so your entire team can access and edit contracts, but users report that their permissions are limited and hard to assign, so making sure people have access to the RIGHT contracts can be tricky.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat customers are saying:\n\n“Downsides of the product tend to be primarily the price — Ironclad is one of the leading platforms in contract management and as Ironclad delivers many premium features no one else offers, their pricing model tends to be on the premium end, which might not be ideal for smaller businesses.”\n\nPrice range: Agiloft does not openly share pricing information on its website.\n\nAgiloft at a glance: Agiloft has been around for a while, offering an end-to-end contract management solution with high customizability. However, its grid structure and somewhat dated user interface have been described as bulky and complex, with a G2 score of 8.4 for ease of use and 6.9 for ease of setup.\n• None While this is often a strength, the learning curve for implementing and adapting to Agiloft's customization options can be a bit much for some.\n• None Agiloft is a solution with a ton of useful tools like approval workflows and a document repository, but you may end up paying for some features you’ll never use, especially at more premium levels.\n• None Agiloft excels at streamlining contract processes, but some find its extensive automation features difficult to master.\n• None While it's handy to monitor contract performance, the platform's dated interface can make accessing these insights less intuitive than you'd hope.\n• None With Agiloft, expect a longer timeline for setup. While it does offer a dedicated implementation specialist, it does not alleviate the lengthy process.\n\nWhat customers are saying:\n\n“Unless you have a proficient dedicated IT in-house support who can set up the system, you will have to invest in some time at the start along with Agiloft to customise to your liking. I think most companies do not use even 50% of Agiloft's capabilities.”\n\nPrice range: LinkSquares does not openly share pricing information on its website.\n\nLinkSquares at a glance: LinkSquares is an AI-powered contract management system with three product types: Finalize, focusing on contract creation; Sign, enabling e-signatures; and Analyze, utilizing AI to extract data and offering insights from contracts. However, its costly implementation, a longer-than-expected setup process, and the lack of contract editing capabilities could be potential drawbacks for some businesses.\n• None LinkSquares' AI capabilities are a prominent feature, pulling in multiple data fields from contracts, aiding in metadata extraction, and providing actionable insights. However, the accuracy of the AI tool isn't always spot-on, and it can take as long as seven to 10 days.\n• None LinkSquares offers a suite of tools, each focusing on different parts of the contract lifecycle. However, some users find the Finalize module for contract creation and sending to be difficult to work with and time-consuming, as you need to move between the separate tools.\n• None LinkSquares uses a tagging system instead of folders, which has been a point of contention for some users who find it clunky to navigate.\n\nWhat customers are saying:\n\n“The contract template creation functionality is a little cumbersome, which is fairly inevitable for a system of this nature. On occasion the system can be slightly slow to load or to run particular reports, but in general we're delighted with the system.”\n\nPrice range: $9.50/mo per user for basic; $27/mo per user for advanced; with custom options for more than 50 users\n\nContractZen at a glance: ContractZen is a European-based contract management solution, deploying a cloud-based platform and offering an assortment of tools tailored to help businesses proficiently manage their contracts. While it lacks certain features found in other platforms, like AI capabilities, it compensates with robust security, a competitive price point, and useful collaboration tools. However, e-signature integration bugs and the inability to customize fields might be potential drawbacks for some businesses.\n• None ContractZen has been noted for its simplicity and straightforward implementation process; however, the user interface could be more streamlined, as some users find the visible features overwhelming.\n• None Despite its cloud-based capabilities, ContractZen falls short with limited search functionality, making contract retrieval potentially more time-consuming than other platforms.\n• None With pricing at $9.50 per user per month, ContractZen is competitively priced and could be a cost-effective solution for smaller teams. However, its per-user limit, 50 GB cap on storage space, and no custom fields could push larger organizations toward more flexible solutions.\n• None While ContractZen does offer e-signature integration, users have reported occasional glitches, which could impact the efficiency of contract signing and approval processes.\n\nWhat customers are saying:\n\n“All our documents are in a single location, and it's easy to find information…Some times the UI could be more streamlined, there are a lot of features always visible.”\n\nPrice range: SpotDraft does not openly share pricing information on its website.\n\nSpotDraft at a glance: SpotDraft is a contract management tool that focuses on contract generation and template management, making it a fitting choice for businesses dealing with large volumes of standard contracts. It prides itself on its natural language processing capabilities and integration with select CRMs, though its interface is complex and laggy, and some of its processes are rigid.\n• None SpotDraft's use of natural language processing makes it a powerful ally in handling large volumes of standard contracts, but the platform's focus on contract generation can sometimes overshadow other contract management needs.\n• None SpotDraft puts a lot of emphasis on contract template management. While this is a boon for many, the rigid processes and inability to self-edit templates can be a bit of a thorn in the side.\n• None SpotDraft doesn't shy away from integrating e-signature capabilities and works well with some CRM systems. However, you may find yourself relying on these integrations to fill some gaps in the reporting process.\n• None Although users can get started with SpotDraft within a week, importing and organizing your contracts can put your patience to the test, with full functionality taking up to six weeks to achieve.\n\nWhat customers are saying:\n\n\"The user interface is very simple, however, because the product overall requires data and information to be input, sometimes it can be frustrating to have to go through multiple screens (and remember to go through multiple screens) to make sure everything needed has been captured.”\n\nPrice range: Evisort does not openly share pricing information on its website.\n\nEvisort at a glance: Evisort's clientele boasts big names like Microsoft, Western Union, and Workday, hinting that the platform might be best suited for larger corporations with ample resources. If you're a smaller business or startup, Evisort's intricacies and lack of pricing transparency might make it a less-than-ideal fit.\n• None While Evisort proudly touts AI capable of pinpointing crucial contract details and spotting risks and opportunities, users say they don't trust it enough and manually review everything anyway.\n• Enterprise-grade contract drafting: With a clause library and in-app document editing, you can draft and negotiate contracts directly in Evisort. You can also see get status updates in your dashboard and email alerts, helping you juggle dozens of pre-signature contracts simultaneously.\n• None Evisort uses an old-school method of folder and subfolder organization, which may not offer the flexibility some businesses need if they’re more familiar with a tagging system. You might find it difficult to sort documents by type, which can be a pain point if your business handles a variety of contracts.\n• None Evisort offers a 30-day onboarding period with no specific setup time, which could be a pro or con depending on your business's requirements and the complexity of your contracts.\n\nWhat customers are saying:\n\n“Evisort is great for finding your contracts and automating the contract review process. It is also super helpful at finding key aspects of your contract such as effective date and term provisions. Evisort can seem a bit complicated if you aren't familiar with the platform, especially when building workflows.”\n\nPrice range: $25/mo per user for standard; $40/mo per user for enterprise\n\nDocuSign at a glance: DocuSign, a well-known name in the e-signature space, also offers a contract lifecycle management solution. It aims for accessibility and is designed to be easy for non-technical users. Despite this, DocuSign might not be the most robust option when it comes to contract management. Its difficulty with contract edits, lack of advanced features for legal teams, and an arguably long implementation timeline are potential pain points for businesses.\n• None One significant downside is that it is reportedly difficult to edit contracts within DocuSign. Any changes often require starting from scratch, leading to inefficiencies.\n• None DocuSign does not capture key metadata, making it challenging to search or report on data within the system.\n• None Some users have reported a longer-than-expected implementation timeline, which may be a drawback for businesses needing a quick setup.\n• None Many users have reported a sluggish system and clunky user interface.\n\nWhat customers are saying:\n\n“The Dashboard UI can be improved and need more customization option to add widgets.\n\nThe reports take a lot of time to generate.\n\nThe time it takes to view merge preview can be reduced.”\n\nPrice range: Outlaw does not openly share pricing information on its website.\n\nOutlaw at a glance: Outlaw is a contract management solution with robust features, such as batch contract generation and advanced templates. It is specifically designed for in-house legal teams and has a unique \"Deal Room\" feature for negotiating contracts. Despite its strengths, the platform has its drawbacks in the form of rigid editing abilities and limited customization, which can hamper contract tracking and auditing. It lets you create a lot of contracts in a hurry, but lacks the nuance and customization to manage ongoing contracts effectively.\n• None Outlaw shines when it comes to batch contract generation and automated workflows, thanks to its strong set of templates, though the document editing process is quite rigid.\n• None Despite having a \"Deal Room\" feature to enable collaboration on contracts, sharing documents with external stakeholders can be a challenge.\n• None While Outlaw offers a visually appealing interface, customization opportunities are limited. Users have expressed the need for more flexibility in customizing the platform to align with their specific workflows and requirements.\n• None Outlaw's search features may not meet the expectations of all users, as it has been reported to be weak, lacking more advanced options to find specific documents.\n\nWhat customers are saying:\n\n“Overall it is great, though the sharing functionality can sometimes be confusing for counterparties who don't have any experience using the software.”\n\nGatekeeper at a glance: Gatekeeper is a contract management solution that primarily caters to procurement teams, offering integration with CRM and ERP systems for streamlined procurement processes. While it has some notable advantages in the procurement space, it is cost-prohibitive.\n• None Gatekeeper offers robust features tailored specifically for procurement teams, but this could prove to be limiting if you're in need of a wider feature set.\n• None Gatekeeper's integration with CRM and ERP systems allows for seamless data flow and coordination between different platforms, though you may find yourself leaning on these integrations to access certain contract lifecycle features, which can result in the need to use multiple platforms, increasing costs when the system already comes at a high price point.\n• None Gatekeeper comes with some pre-made reporting features, but some users have noted that the report templates were insufficient for their business’s needs.\n\nWhat customers are saying:\n\n“There is an abundance of data in Gatekeeper but at times, it can be difficult to extract or visualise data sets to compare data. This is more problematic on the spend module but overall, we've found the reporting capabilities and real time use of the product to far outweigh this.”\n\nSee for Yourself Why Customers Prefer ContractSafe\n\nContractSafe’s intuitive platform has helped countless organizations streamline their contract management processes to save time and improve efficiency.\n\nWith an easy-to-navigate interface and robust organizational features, you can quickly and easily find any contract, track key information, and stay on top of important deadlines.\n\nAnd with unlimited users, ContractSafe is the go-to solution for businesses of all sizes.\n\nReady to see what ContractSafe can do for you?\n\nSchedule a demo today and let our team show you how ContractSafe can revolutionize the way you manage your contracts.\n\nDisclaimer: Prices are accurate as of May 1, 2024."

        "document": "Contract AI assistants are among the newest and most transformative contract management software features in 2025. With the right legal AI tool, businesses can automate legal processes like contract drafting, review and analysis, getting results in seconds.\n\nThis means that teams can create and agree contracts faster than ever before. In fact, Juro users can agree their contracts 10x faster, freeing up legal's time for higher-value tasks and reducing low-value admin work.\n\nYou can find out what's possible in this guide to AI-enabled contract management software.\n\nA rich-text contract editor is one of the most important features of contract management software. It enables legal teams to pre-define contract templates that business users can use to self-serve on contracts.\n\nBusinesses without contract management software will usually rely on Microsoft Word to draft contracts. But there’s no way for legal to control which terms make it into the contracts that commercial teams send out for signing. Instead, contracts quickly become a patchwork of different, often outdated, templates.\n\nJuro users don’t have this problem. Juro’s contract management software enables legal to control which terms appear in contracts using conditional logic. This enables commercial teams to self-serve confidently on contracts with minimal oversight from legal, and it improves the entire contract management process.\n\nApproval workflows are another useful feature in contract management tools. They enable teams to get contracts reviewed and approved faster without bypassing senior stakeholders.\n\nWithout the right tools in place, approvals can become a bottleneck for businesses. Approval requests sit in a backlog of other tasks. Before you know it, these delays in the sales cycle have resulted in lost revenue. Contracts may even sneak past the approval stage altogether.\n\nContract management software removes that risk. Juro’s customizable approval workflows mean that you can be selective about which contracts require approval. You can also send approval reminders to move things along.\n\nBrowser-based redlining is one of the most sought-after contract management software features since it enables teams to negotiate contracts in real time.\n\nWithout this feature, teams are forced to jump between multiple different tools to negotiate contracts. This process of switching between Word files, emails, and PDFs can slow sales cycles down and make it difficult to track edits.\n\nContract management software like Juro centralizes contract negotiations, with browser-based redlining, detailed audit trails, and split internal and external versions.\n\nYou should also look for contract management software with native eSignature functionality. This enables teams to add legally binding electronic signatures to contracts from anywhere, on any device. Some contract management systems, like Juro, even allow users to mass-sign routine contracts.\n\nIn a manual workflow, contracts are signed using wet ink signatures or scanned signatures. Some businesses use a separate eSigning tool like DocuSign or Adobe Sign to sign contracts electronically. But this still means moving between multiple tools just to get contracts over the line.\n\nChoosing contract management software that offers native eSignature removes this friction and makes it possible create and sign contracts in one workspace.\n\nIt is also worth choosing contract management software with automated renewal reminders. This feature allows you to track your contracts and manage upcoming deadlines with ease.\n\nBusinesses that don’t have a contract management tool usually track their contract data manually in a contract management spreadsheet. This involves extracting and inputting data from individual contracts, which can be a waste of legal’s already stretched time.\n\nAll of these deadlines are captured automatically in Juro, so you don’t have to worry about the admin work. You can also set up automated contract reminders so you never miss a renewal deadline again.\n\nWhere you store your contracts matters, particularly as your contract volumes grow. That’s why it’s important to find a contract management platform with a smart storage solution.\n\nIn many businesses, contracts are scattered across shared drives. This means they’re difficult to find, hard to monitor, and virtually impossible to report on.\n\nContract management software like Juro enables you to get more from your contracts post-signature. Not only does Juro let you store your contracts securely, but it also has an analytics feature that enables you to report on contracts and track progress against legal KPIs.\n\nWhich is the best contract management software?\n\nJuro's contract management software empowers all teams to create, agree, execute and manage contracts up to 10x faster than traditional tools.\n\nIt is the only platform specifically designed to work for both legal and commercial teams, meaning faster contracting cycles and lower business risk.\n\nWith Juro, legal teams can enable other business teams to automate routine contracting, so they move faster and you can work on tasks that have more impact.\n\nFind out how Funnel use Juro's integration with HubSpot to save 80% of time on contracts in the video below.\n\nJuro is one of the top-rated contract management tools on the market, with ratings of 4.8 out of 5 on Capterra and 4.7 out of 5 on G2.\n\nJuro is also #1 rated by for speed of implementation by G2, meaning Juro’s customers get to value quickly with Juro - unlike some other digital contracting tools.\n\nAnd this implementation record sets the platform in good stead for adoption, too. Juro has the highest adoption of any CLM, according to independent G2 reviews. This means that value compounds quickly over time, delivering value throughout the business and winning back time for anyone that touches contracts day-to-day.\n\nJuro powers contracts for 6000+ of the world's fastest-growing companies, including TrustPilot, WeWork, Soundcloud, Deliveroo and AngelList. Juro's also To find out more, book your personalized demo.\n\nPreviously known as SpringCM, DocuSign CLM is one of the oldest contract management solutions on the market.\n\nGiven DocuSign’s reputation, the tool is often considered by businesses looking to invest in contract management software. It offers renewal reminders, approval workflows, and many other features that help to streamline the contract lifecycle.\n\nBut it does have some drawbacks.\n\nAccording to independent reviews on G2 and Capterra, DocuSign CLM’s user interface isn’t as intuitive as more modern tools. There are also some templating restrictions due to DocuSign CLM’s reliance on Microsoft Word for contract drafting.\n\nMost notably, DocuSign CLM’s users report long delays in time-to-value. This is because DocuSign CLM is designed for enterprise-level businesses so it can have a costly and lengthy implementation period.\n\nDocuSign CLM is one of the lower-rated contract management tools, with a score of 4.3 out of 5 on Capterra. This is considerably lower than Juro’s Capterra score of 4.8.\n\nBelow are some independent reviews left by DocuSign CLM users:\n\nOutlaw is another popular contract management tool. But it’s also one of the most expensive solutions on the market.\n\nThis contract management software allows users to create templates, negotiate within the platform, and store contracts securely - just like Juro.\n\nHowever, there are some important differences between Outlaw and Juro.\n\nAccording to G2, reviewers find Juro easier to use and set up than Outlaw. This means Outlaw may not be the best option if you’re looking for a user-friendly contract management software.\n\nIndependent reviews of Outlaw also mention that populating a template can be ‘slightly confusing’. This may be a problem for commercial teams that need to self-serve on contract creation.\n\nIndependent reviews of Outlaw on G2 rate the tool 4.6 out of 5. This is slightly lower than Juro’s G2 rating of 4.7 out of 5.\n\nBelow are some independent reviews left by verified users of Outlaw:\n\nCobblestone is enterprise-level contract management software that best serves teams managing procurement contracts. It is also one of the oldest solutions on the market, having launched back in 1995.\n\nSince Cobblestone is an enterprise contract management solution, it offers a wide range of useful features. These include contract storage, tracking and reminders. Although, some of these features will be locked behind Cobblestone pricier plans.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that Cobblestone doesn’t include native eSigning in any of its plans. Instead, users will need to integrate the contract management system with a separate eSigning tool. This works well for some businesses, but if you want a truly all-in-one solution, a tool like Juro could work best.\n\nCobblestone is also described as ‘clunky’ in independent reviews on G2 and Capterra. This is worth considering if you’re looking for a simple and intuitive contract management platform.\n\nCobblestone is rated 4.8 out of 5 on both G2 and Capterra. Below are some independent reviews left by verified Cobblestone users:\n\nConga is a contract management software solution for sales teams. Like Juro, the tool integrates with Salesforce and other CRMs, making it easier for sales teams to manage contracts in the tools they know and love.\n\nUsers have access to approval workflows, native eSignature and more. Conga also own a range of other sales-focused products, such as quoting software. However, these would need to be purchased separately.\n\nThere are also some limitations of Conga.\n\nIn fact, many of the features that legal teams need from contract management software are missing from Conga. For example, contract drafting still happens in Microsoft Word, rather than in a native template editor created specifically for contracts.\n\nThey also have a separate eSigning tool, Conga Sign, that they integrate with. Connecting all of these different tools can complicate the contract process further, rather than simplifying it. This is clear from independent reviews.\n\nDespite being popular, Conga is one of the lowest-rated contract management platforms on the market. It has an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on G2, which is significantly lower than Juro’s G2 rating of 4.7 out of 5.\n\nBelow are some reviews left by verified Conga users:\n\nContractworks is a contract management tool favored for its repository and security. Users have access to custom reporting, notifications, OCR search functionality, and more.\n\nTheir customers include companies like KidKraft, Shift4 Payments and Annkissam.\n\nHowever, Contractworks lacks some of the features that enable commercial teams to self-serve efficiently on contracts. For example, Contractworks doesn't have a native contract editor or collaborative workspace. Instead, users will need to redline and collaborate on contracts in Microsoft Word.\n\nG2 reviews left by Contractworks users also suggest that auto-tagging isn't always accurate or effective, resulting in the need to tag contracts manually.\n\nContractworks has a strong rating in G2, like Juro, but with fewer reviews overall. However, Contractworks reviewers have flagged several areas of improvement for the tool.\n\nThese include improving the tagging experience and enabling parties to populate contracts through Q&A forms, which is possible in contract management platforms like Juro.\n\nBelow are some reviews left by verified Contractworks users:\n\nLegal and business teams typically implement contract management software when contract volumes increase to a point where managing them in Word and shared drives is impractical.\n\nIf you are signing more than 10 contracts a month, you have likely felt the pain of a manual workflow and would benefit from implementing contract software. This pain can be felt differently across teams and businesses.\n\nIt could be that your legal team is buried in low-value contract admin, or that you’re struggling to manage contract volumes without scaling your headcount.\n\nOr, that slow and inefficient contracting processes are slowing down your sales cycles and resulting in lost revenue.\n\nIt might even be that missed renewal dates and contract management mistakes are costing your business in the long-run.\n\nIf any of this sounds familiar, it’s probably time for you to consider contract management software. To speak to a specialist about how contract management software could benefit your business, book a personalized demo today.\n\nChoosing a contract management solution that's fit for the future\n\nWe hear your frustrations about contract tools in 2025. When we asked 160+ in-house lawyers what frustrates them most about legal tech, they mentioned the following things:\n• 73 per cent of in-house lawyers find legal tech to be too expensive\n• 43 per cent of in-house lawyers report difficulties with weak adoption amongst business colleagues\n• 38 per cent of in-house lawyers struggle with poor user experience\n\nAt Juro, we spend a great deal of time thinking about the future of contract management platforms. We have helped our customers process 2 million contracts in over 85 countries, and we're proud to have helped them, and many more, collectively save millions of hours on low-value work.\n\nIntelligent contract management software like ours will shift legal teams from being front-end users of CLM to back-end enablers. Instead of manually reviewing and approving every contract, lawyers will set playbooks and guardrails that allow business teams to self-serve on contract tasks.\n\nAI-native CLMs will not only automate workflows but also learn from contract data, streamlining negotiation and execution. Contracts will be deeply embedded in existing tools—imagine a sales rep generating, negotiating, and signing a contract entirely within Salesforce. Or a hiring manager requesting a new employment contract in Slack and receiving a draft instantly.\n\nTo stay ahead, businesses need a CLM that doesn’t just digitize contracts but transforms them into intelligent, automated workflows—accelerating deal cycles, reducing legal bottlenecks, and embedding contracts where work actually happens.\n\nThat's what our customers are getting at Juro, and you can join them.\n\nWhat does a contract management tool do?\n\nA contract management tool streamlines the contract lifecycle from drafting all the way to contract execution and performance. It brings contracts into one dynamic workspace, making it quicker and easier to collaborate on contracts and get deals over the line.\n\nWhat is the difference between CRM and contract management?\n\nCRM stands for customer relationship management, which contracts play a part in. However, most CRM systems don't have contract management functionality, so you'll need to integrate a contract management system like Juro to create and manage contracts within them.\n\nYou can read more about how this works in these guides to contract management in Salesforce and HubSpot.\n\nDoes contract management software help with searching and reporting?\n\nContract management software is extremely helpful for searching through and reporting on contracts. Contract management solutions like Juro enable you to store, query, view and report on contracts with ease.\n\nJuro's contract management software provides a secure home for your contracts, with granular access controls, consolidated document records and additional security options. Read more here.\n\nLegal teams, specifically GCs, are the primary user for a contract management system in many businesses. However, it's also common for commercial teams or executives to work within the platform, especially in organizations with a lean or non-existent legal team.\n\nHow is contract management software different from eSignature solutions?\n\nContract management software seeks to add value and streamline the process at every stage of the contract workflow, meanwhile eSignature solutions only seek to add value at the point of signing.\n\nBoth contract tools offer eSignature functionality, but contract management software will deliver lots of additional features that enable legal teams to manage large volumes of contracts more efficiently.\n\nWhere can I find out more about contract management?\n\nTo find out more about contract management, fill in the form below to speak with a specialist.

        "document": "Managing contracts is an integral part of your law department's functions. This vital work becomes much more difficult if you don't have a contract management system (CLM) in place.\n\nUnfortunately, many companies use outdated or inefficient systems, slowing down their business and potentially impacting key vendor relationships.\n\nHere are four steps to implementing a contract management system (CMS) to help ensure your internal processes will support your success.\n\n1. Assess the current state of contract management for your business\n\nBefore you can implement a new CMS, you first need to accurately assess the current state of your system, identify its shortcomings, and propose a solution to key decision makers within your organization. You also need to enlist the help and support of other users of the current system outside the legal department, such as the sales team, IT, and finance.\n\nHere are some questions to ask during your contract management assessment:\n• Are contract activities conducted in a fragmented or ad hoc manner? That is, are contracts drafted from templates created by individual counsel or managed simply by aggregating them in filing cabinets?\n• Is there a consensus that contracts take too much time? Are they too manual? Do they involve too many steps? Are they difficult or time consuming to get approved? Are they disorganized, especially when it comes to tracking due dates? Are they supported by too few personnel, causing bottlenecks in the system?\n\nIf the answer to any of the above questions is yes, further consider:\n• Are any of or all the current contracting tools — like filing systems, policies, procedures, spreadsheets, databases, and information technology — inadequate for the required tasks?\n• Where within the contract management process can automation help?\n• What other systems, technologies, or best practices in use elsewhere could help improve the current situation? Can they be integrated into a future CMS?\n\nOnce you’ve conducted your CMS assessment and assembled the information, document your findings and solutions in a report. List all your requirements so they are clear to stakeholders as well. This report will help you make the business case for change to your senior leadership or any company budgetary authorities.\n\nImplementing a contract management process affects many people across the enterprise. It can involve changing employees’ roles, corporate processes, or culture, so you must obtain sponsorship from senior company leadership outside the law department.\n• Articulate the importance of a contract management process to all stakeholders involved.\n• Set clear objectives and expectations regarding strategy, financial performance, and legal and compliance requirements.\n• Drive the organizational changes needed to build a streamlined and successful contract management process.\n• Direct stakeholders to implement and support the contract management process.\n• Allocate resources such as funding, personnel, and technology to implement the system.\n\nWhen it comes to improving contract management, it’s vital to engage your internal business partners. Bringing them on board at the beginning promotes buy-in, which is essential for the successful development and implementation of your CMS.\n• The legal team. This team comprises partners, associates, paralegals, file clerks, and other administrative roles.\n• The audit team. This team assesses your contracts to eliminate risk and offers checks and balances for your firm.\n• The compliance team. Members of this time will guarantee that you fully uphold regulations and your company's standards.\n• The sales team. Employees on the sales team must be familiar with how your contracts work in order to sell your services.\n• The procurement team. When making any purchases for your company, the procurement team will be involved in and must have access to the contract management system.\n\n4. Strategically manage the process by engaging the people\n\nYou’ve done your careful analysis, received sponsorship from senior leadership, and obtained buy-in from colleagues in other key departments. Congratulations! You have now successfully developed an improved contract management system. But the real work has just begun, as you must now implement and maintain this system. The continued involvement of your legal department is crucial in doing so.\n• Ensures all principal stakeholders receive training on the new contract management process. They can set up the trainings and update stakeholders as needed, such as when a newer system version is released.\n• Engages the right business personnel at appropriate stages throughout the contract management process. They will contact partners and associates when needed, push contracts to compliance and audits, and make sure the contract management process runs smoothly all around.\n• Maintains and updates the templates, policies, and procedures that underpin the contract management process. They are available to review processes and determine what's working and what's not while making the necessary changes.\n\nLooking for more insights into contact management systems?\n\nThese four keys will provide a framework for your law department to develop and implement a successful contract management system.\n\nFor additional best practices in contract management, read the white paper, Smarter About Contracts, or request a demo of a CLM solution."

        "document": "Web development is a dynamic and ever-evolving field that plays a pivotal role in shaping the digital landscape. It encompasses a vast array of technologies, languages, and frameworks, all aimed at creating, designing, and maintaining websites and web applications.\n\nAt the heart of web development lies HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). These two languages form the foundational building blocks of the web.\n\nHTML provides the structure for web pages by defining the elements that organize content. It uses tags enclosed in angle brackets to mark up content, making it possible for browsers to render the page. HTML elements include headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more.\n\nLearn more about HTML here.\n\nWhile HTML defines the structure, CSS takes care of the presentation. CSS is used to style HTML elements, determining their size, color, position, and layout. It allows developers to create visually appealing web pages.\n\nLearn more about CSS here.\n\nFull stack development is a holistic approach that involves working with the full stack of the involved technology layers. Full stack developers work on both the client side (front-end) and server side (back-end) of web applications. Full stack developers are proficient in a range of technologies and can tackle every aspect of a project.\n\nBack-end development focuses on server-side logic, databases, and the application's core functionality. Technologies like Java, Python, and Node.js are commonly used for back-end development.\n\nFront-end development concentrates on the user interface and user experience. It involves creating interactive and visually appealing web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n\nDatabases are central to web applications for storing, retrieving, and managing data. Relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and NoSQL databases like MongoDB are widely used.\n\nFull stack developers often work with frameworks and libraries that streamline development. For example, the Spring framework in Java simplifies back-end development, while React.js and Angular enhance front-end development.\n\nSpring is a powerful framework for building enterprise-level Java applications. It simplifies the development of complex, robust, and scalable applications.\n\nSpring implements Inversion of Control (IoC), which allows developers to define the relationships between components and manage their lifecycle. This reduces complexity and enhances modularity.\n\nSpring supports Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), allowing developers to modularize cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, and transactions. AOP separates concerns in large-scale applications.\n\nSpring Boot, an extension of the Spring Framework, simplifies the development of production-ready applications.

        "document": "Front-End Web Development Mastery TL;DR: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are vital for user-friendly web design. Insights reveal mobile dominance, SEO benefits, and revenue increases from optimized front-end techniques. Integrating these three languages synergistically creates robust, engaging websites essential for competitive careers in web development. Front-End Web Dev is the real deal when it comes to creating killer user experiences on websites. It's like being the architect of the digital realm, designing layouts that are smooth and easy to navigate. You gotta flex those HTML, CSS, and JavaScript muscles to craft responsive and accessible web pages that are straight-up fire. The front-end game is crucial because it brings designs to life with interactive visuals that keep users hooked and boosts those conversion rates. With the rise of HTML5 and frameworks like React, front-end skills have leveled up, bridging the gap between visual concepts and functional interfaces like a boss. Over 54% of web traffic is from mobile devices (thanks, Statista!). That's why AI-powered experiences and mobile-first strategies are all the rage. The front-end world is evolving faster than you can say \"responsive design,\" so you gotta stay on your toes and keep learning. Amazon knows what's up – even small improvements in load time can lead to a massive revenue boost. That's how crucial front-end optimization is. If you want to be a front-end wizard, you gotta start with the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Once you've got those down, you'll be unstoppable at Nucamp.\n• None Bringing it all Together: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript\n• None Achieve Front-End Web Development Mastery by learning how to seamlessly integrate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into your projects. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the core of what makes websites look dope. Without it, you'd just have a bunch of text and images all over the place. Mastering HTML syntax, with its precise mix of elements like and attributes, is crucial for creating user-friendly web pages that don't drive you crazy. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the big wigs of the web, say that using proper HTML tags like and is essential for making your site accessible to everyone, including folks with disabilities, and also helps search engines find your content more easily. Following basic HTML conventions like properly nesting tags and using semantic elements can boost your search engine rankings by up to 10%. That's a game-changer! Attributes like for images and don't just make your site accessible, but they can also give your SEO a serious boost. Sites that are accessible see double the user engagement, according to the Global Web Index. That's some serious street cred right there. And if you're using HTML5 elements like and , you could see a 15% increase in user satisfaction because your site's navigation is just that intuitive. Léonie Watson, a web accessibility pro, says developers should write HTML with screen reader users in mind, which just reinforces how important it is to structure your content thoughtfully. In short, getting a solid grasp of HTML's building blocks isn't just about making your site look good – it's about making it accessible, user-friendly, and easily discoverable by search engines. That's the key to getting your site out there and engaging with more users. Just ask the experts at places like General Assembly and BYJU'S FutureSchool. HTML is the foundation for a killer web presence, so you better start learning it if you want to be a real player in the digital game.\n\nCSS is the real deal when it comes to styling websites. It's the secret sauce that makes over 95% of websites look fresh and clean. At its core, CSS is a language that lets you pimp out your HTML content with all sorts of cool styles and layouts. The way it works is through selectors and declaration blocks, like: Selectors are like the targets that tell CSS which HTML elements to style.\n• Class selectors (.classname) for styling multiple elements at once,\n• ID selectors (#idname) for giving an element a unique look,\n• Pseudo-class selectors (:hover) for styling elements in different states. Once you got your targets locked, you can go wild with all sorts of properties to control the layout and appearance. The property lets you switch up text colors, while adjusts the spacing around elements. But the real game-changer is the CSS Box Model, which lets you control margins, borders, padding, and content areas for some next-level layouts. To really level up your CSS game, you gotta master techniques like shorthand properties, responsive design with media queries, and using the Flexbox or Grid systems for layouts that adapt to any screen size. CSS is the secret weapon for making websites look slick and engaging users. \"mastering CSS is like mastering the fine art of web development, infusing sites with a soulful presence that deeply connects with users.\" If you want to become a CSS pro and create websites that not only look dope but also convert visitors, check out comprehensive resources to level up your skills. Let me break it down for you on this JavaScript stuff. It's the language that makes websites interactive and dope, ya feel me? Like, 65% of developers worldwide are using it, so it's kind of a big deal. When you're writing code, you gotta follow the syntax rules, which basically tell you how to structure everything so it makes sense. For example, when you declare variables (like, placeholders for data), you got three main options:\n• let allows you to create variables that can be updated later on. These variables are limited to the block they're in, so they don't mess with stuff outside their scope.\n• const is for variables that can't be changed once you set them. These are also block-level, so they stay in their lane.\n• var used to be the go-to, but it's got some issues with hoisting and scope, so most devs avoid it these days. The key is to write clean, modular code that's easy to read and maintain. That means breaking your code into functions, with each function doing one specific task. It makes your code more organized and reusable, which is a win-win. Like, you might have a simple function that greets someone: But where JavaScript really shines is in making websites interactive. You can use it to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), which is like the blueprint of a webpage. By handling events like clicks, hovers, and keypresses, you can make your site respond to what users do. Instead of messing with the DOM directly (which can slow things down), you can use event listeners to add cool effects and make the user experience smoother. So, in a nutshell, JavaScript is the language that brings websites to life. It's all about following the syntax rules, writing clean code, and using events to create awesome interactive experiences. It's a must-have skill for any web developer who wants to stay on top of their game.\n\nBringing it all Together: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript When it comes to weaving the fabric of a dope webpage, we gotta rely on the holy trinity of web dev: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each one's got its own distinct flavor, but they all come together like a tight crew to build a site's structure, style, and interactivity, respectively. For instance, HTML lays down the foundation with its essential elements, structuring the content with paragraphs, headings, and nav bars – the kind of fundamental knowledge that nearly 90% of pro devs gotta have on lock. CSS then steps in with its fresh styles, customizing fonts and layouts to make that bad boy responsive and visually stunning, a skill that 95.1% of frontend devs embrace, according to Stack Overflow's stats. JavaScript, the third pillar, brings the dynamism, updating content and responding to user actions like a boss. An overwhelming 97.6% of websites rock this client-side behavior, as MDN Web Docs points out. To see this killer combo in action, peep a form built with HTML's structured inputs and submit button, styled by CSS to look straight-up fire and adaptive to any device, and infused with JavaScript for validations and server communication without page reloads – just like the homies at University of Texas Bootcamps demonstrated with their guide to these fundamental front-end languages. Industry benchmarks stress the importance of optimizing web performance through techniques like minimizing file sizes and reducing HTTP requests. Tools like Google's PageSpeed Insights report potential loading time improvements of up to 60% just by minifying that bad boy. The refined fusion of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is the kind of rewarding front-end dev that Paul Irish preaches about. Aspiring devs can check out Nucamp's detailed bootcamp offerings focused on these core languages – a solid stepping stone to mastering the craft of web dev.

        "document": "Spring Framework is a Java platform that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications. Spring handles the infrastructure so you can focus on your application.\n\nSpring enables you to build applications from “plain old Java objects” (POJOs) and to apply enterprise services non-invasively to POJOs. This capability applies to the Java SE programming model and to full and partial Java EE.\n\nExamples of how you, as an application developer, can use the Spring platform advantage:\n\n“The question is, what aspect of control are [they] inverting?” Martin Fowler posed this question about Inversion of Control (IoC) on his site in 2004. Fowler suggested renaming the principle to make it more self-explanatory and came up with Dependency Injection. For insight into IoC and DI, refer to Fowler's article at http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html. Java applications -- a loose term that runs the gamut from constrained applets to n-tier server-side enterprise applications -- typically consist of objects that collaborate to form the application proper. Thus the objects in an application have dependencies on each other. Although the Java platform provides a wealth of application development functionality, it lacks the means to organize the basic building blocks into a coherent whole, leaving that task to architects and developers. True, you can use design patterns such as Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Decorator, and Service Locator to compose the various classes and object instances that make up an application. However, these patterns are simply that: best practices given a name, with a description of what the pattern does, where to apply it, the problems it addresses, and so forth. Patterns are formalized best practices that you must implement yourself in your application. The Spring Framework Inversion of Control (IoC) component addresses this concern by providing a formalized means of composing disparate components into a fully working application ready for use. The Spring Framework codifies formalized design patterns as first-class objects that you can integrate into your own application(s). Numerous organizations and institutions use the Spring Framework in this manner to engineer robust, maintainable applications.\n\nThe Spring Framework consists of features organized into about 20 modules. These modules are grouped into Core Container, Data Access/Integration, Web, AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming), Instrumentation, and Test, as shown in the following diagram. The Core Container consists of the Core, Beans, Context, and Expression Language modules. The Core and Beans modules provide the fundamental parts of the framework, including the IoC and Dependency Injection features. The is a sophisticated implementation of the factory pattern. It removes the need for programmatic singletons and allows you to decouple the configuration and specification of dependencies from your actual program logic. The Context module builds on the solid base provided by the Core and Beans modules: it is a means to access objects in a framework-style manner that is similar to a JNDI registry. The Context module inherits its features from the Beans module and adds support for internationalization (using, for example, resource bundles), event-propagation, resource-loading, and the transparent creation of contexts by, for example, a servlet container. The Context module also supports Java EE features such as EJB, JMX ,and basic remoting. The interface is the focal point of the Context module. The Expression Language module provides a powerful expression language for querying and manipulating an object graph at runtime. It is an extension of the unified expression language (unified EL) as specified in the JSP 2.1 specification. The language supports setting and getting property values, property assignment, method invocation, accessing the context of arrays, collections and indexers, logical and arithmetic operators, named variables, and retrieval of objects by name from Spring's IoC container. It also supports list projection and selection as well as common list aggregations. The Data Access/Integration layer consists of the JDBC, ORM, OXM, JMS and Transaction modules. The JDBC module provides a JDBC-abstraction layer that removes the need to do tedious JDBC coding and parsing of database-vendor specific error codes. The ORM module provides integration layers for popular object-relational mapping APIs, including JPA, JDO, Hibernate, and iBatis. Using the ORM package you can use all of these O/R-mapping frameworks in combination with all of the other features Spring offers, such as the simple declarative transaction management feature mentioned previously. The OXM module provides an abstraction layer that supports Object/XML mapping implementations for JAXB, Castor, XMLBeans, JiBX and XStream. The Java Messaging Service (JMS) module contains features for producing and consuming messages. The Transaction module supports programmatic and declarative transaction management for classes that implement special interfaces and for all your POJOs (plain old Java objects). The Web layer consists of the Web, Web-Servlet, Web-Struts, and Web-Portlet modules. Spring's Web module provides basic web-oriented integration features such as multipart file-upload functionality and the initialization of the IoC container using servlet listeners and a web-oriented application context. It also contains the web-related parts of Spring's remoting support. The Web-Servlet module contains Spring's model-view-controller (MVC) implementation for web applications. Spring's MVC framework provides a clean separation between domain model code and web forms, and integrates with all the other features of the Spring Framework. The Web-Struts module contains the support classes for integrating a classic Struts web tier within a Spring application. Note that this support is now deprecated as of Spring 3.0. Consider migrating your application to Struts 2.0 and its Spring integration or to a Spring MVC solution. The Web-Portlet module provides the MVC implementation to be used in a portlet environment and mirrors the functionality of Web-Servlet module. Spring's AOP module provides an AOP Alliance-compliant aspect-oriented programming implementation allowing you to define, for example, method-interceptors and pointcuts to cleanly decouple code that implements functionality that should be separated. Using source-level metadata functionality, you can also incorporate behavioral information into your code, in a manner similar to that of .NET attributes. The separate Aspects module provides integration with AspectJ. The Instrumentation module provides class instrumentation support and classloader implementations to be used in certain application servers. The Test module supports the testing of Spring components with JUnit or TestNG. It provides consistent loading of Spring ApplicationContexts and caching of those contexts. It also provides mock objects that you can use to test your code in isolation.\n\nThe building blocks described previously make Spring a logical choice in many scenarios, from applets to full-fledged enterprise applications that use Spring's transaction management functionality and web framework integration. Spring's declarative transaction management features make the web application fully transactional, just as it would be if you used EJB container-managed transactions. All your custom business logic can be implemented with simple POJOs and managed by Spring's IoC container. Additional services include support for sending email and validation that is independent of the web layer, which lets you choose where to execute validation rules. Spring's ORM support is integrated with JPA, Hibernate, JDO and iBatis; for example, when using Hibernate, you can continue to use your existing mapping files and standard Hibernate configuration. Form controllers seamlessly integrate the web-layer with the domain model, removing the need for or other classes that transform HTTP parameters to values for your domain model. Sometimes circumstances do not allow you to completely switch to a different framework. The Spring Framework does not force you to use everything within it; it is not an all-or-nothing solution. Existing front-ends built with WebWork, Struts, Tapestry, or other UI frameworks can be integrated with a Spring-based middle-tier, which allows you to use Spring transaction features. You simply need to wire up your business logic using an and use a to integrate your web layer. When you need to access existing code through web services, you can use Spring's , , or classes. Enabling remote access to existing applications is not difficult. The Spring Framework also provides an access and abstraction layer for Enterprise JavaBeans, enabling you to reuse your existing POJOs and wrap them in stateless session beans for use in scalable, fail-safe web applications that might need declarative security. Dependency management and dependency injection are different things. To get those nice features of Spring into your application (like dependency injection) you need to assemble all the libraries needed (jar files) and get them onto your classpath at runtime, and possibly at compile time. These dependencies are not virtual components that are injected, but physical resources in a file system (typically). The process of dependency management involves locating those resources, storing them and adding them to classpaths. Dependencies can be direct (e.g. my application depends on Spring at runtime), or indirect (e.g. my application depends on which depends on ). The indirect dependencies are also known as \"transitive\" and it is those dependencies that are hardest to identify and manage. If you are going to use Spring you need to get a copy of the jar libraries that comprise the pieces of Spring that you need. To make this easier Spring is packaged as a set of modules that separate the dependencies as much as possible, so for example if you don't want to write a web application you don't need the spring-web modules. To refer to Spring library modules in this guide we use a shorthand naming convention or where \"*\" represents the short name for the module (e.g. , , , etc.). The actual jar file name that you use may be in this form (see below) or it may not, and normally it also has a version number in the file name (e.g. ). In general, Spring publishes its artifacts to four different places:\n• On the community download site http://www.springsource.org/download/community. Here you find all the Spring jars bundled together into a zip file for easy download. The names of the jars here since version 3.0 are in the form .\n• Maven Central, which is the default repository that Maven queries, and does not require any special configuration to use. Many of the common libraries that Spring depends on also are available from Maven Central and a large section of the Spring community uses Maven for dependency management, so this is convenient for them. The names of the jars here are in the form and the Maven groupId is .\n• The Enterprise Bundle Repository (EBR), which is run by SpringSource and also hosts all the libraries that integrate with Spring. Both Maven and Ivy repositories are available here for all Spring jars and their dependencies, plus a large number of other common libraries that people use in applications with Spring. Both full releases and also milestones and development snapshots are deployed here. The names of the jar files are in the same form as the community download ( ), and the dependencies are also in this \"long\" form, with external libraries (not from SpringSource) having the prefix . See the FAQ for more information.\n• In a public Maven repository hosted on Amazon S3 for development snapshots and milestone releases (a copy of the final releases is also held here). The jar file names are in the same form as Maven Central, so this is a useful place to get development versions of Spring to use with other libraries deployed in Maven Central. So the first thing you need to decide is how to manage your dependencies: most people use an automated system like Maven or Ivy, but you can also do it manually by downloading all the jars yourself. When obtaining Spring with Maven or Ivy you have then to decide which place you'll get it from. In general, if you care about OSGi, use the EBR, since it houses OSGi compatible artifacts for all of Spring's dependencies, such as Hibernate and Freemarker. If OSGi does not matter to you, either place works, though there are some pros and cons between them. In general, pick one place or the other for your project; do not mix them. This is particularly important since EBR artifacts necessarily use a different naming convention than Maven Central artifacts. Hundreds; those that Spring integrates with Varies. Newer artifacts often use domain name, e.g. org.slf4j. Older ones often just use the artifact name, e.g. log4j. Domain name of origin or main package root, e.g. org.springframework Varies. Generally the project or module name, using a hyphen \"-\" separator, e.g. spring-core, logj4. Bundle Symbolic Name, derived from the main package root, e.g. org.springframework.beans. If the jar had to be patched to ensure OSGi compliance then com.springsource is appended, e.g. com.springsource.org.apache.log4j Varies. Many new artifacts use m.m.m or m.m.m.X (with m=digit, X=text). Older ones use m.m. Some neither. Ordering is defined but not often relied on, so not strictly reliable. OSGi version number m.m.m.X, e.g. 3.0.0.RC3. The text qualifier imposes alphabetic ordering on versions with the same numeric values. Usually automatic via rsync or source control updates. Project authors can upload individual jars to JIRA. By policy. Accuracy is responsibility of authors. Extensive for OSGi manifest, Maven POM and Ivy metadata. QA performed by Spring team. Contegix. Funded by Sonatype with several mirrors. Although Spring provides integration and support for a huge range of enterprise and other external tools, it intentionally keeps its mandatory dependencies to an absolute minimum: you shouldn't have to locate and download (even automatically) a large number of jar libraries in order to use Spring for simple use cases. For basic dependency injection there is only one mandatory external dependency, and that is for logging (see below for a more detailed description of logging options). Next we outline the basic steps needed to configure an application that depends on Spring, first with Maven and then with Ivy. In all cases, if anything is unclear, refer to the documentation of your dependency management system, or look at some sample code - Spring itself uses Ivy to manage dependencies when it is building, and our samples mostly use Maven. If you are using Maven for dependency management you don't even need to supply the logging dependency explicitly. For example, to create an application context and use dependency injection to configure an application, your Maven dependencies will look like this: That's it. Note the scope can be declared as runtime if you don't need to compile against Spring APIs, which is typically the case for basic dependency injection use cases. We used the Maven Central naming conventions in the example above, so that works with Maven Central or the SpringSource S3 Maven repository. To use the S3 Maven repository (e.g. for milestones or developer snapshots), you need to specify the repository location in your Maven configuration. For full releases: To use the SpringSource EBR you would need to use a different naming convention for the dependencies. The names are usually easy to guess, e.g. in this case it is: You also need to declare the location of the repository explicitly (only the URL is important): If you are managing your dependencies by hand, the URL in the repository declaration above is not browsable, but there is a user interface at http://www.springsource.com/repository that can be used to search for and download dependencies. It also has handy snippets of Maven and Ivy configuration that you can copy and paste if you are using those tools. If you prefer to use Ivy to manage dependencies then there are similar names and configuration options. To configure Ivy to point to the SpringSource EBR add the following resolvers to your : The XML above is not valid because the lines are too long - if you copy-paste then remove the extra line endings in the middle of the url patterns. Once Ivy is configured to look in the EBR adding a dependency is easy. Simply pull up the details page for the bundle in question in the repository browser and you'll find an Ivy snippet ready for you to include in your dependencies section. For example (in ): Logging is a very important dependency for Spring because a) it is the only mandatory external dependency, b) everyone likes to see some output from the tools they are using, and c) Spring integrates with lots of other tools all of which have also made a choice of logging dependency. One of the goals of an application developer is often to have unified logging configured in a central place for the whole application, including all external components. This is more difficult than it might have been since there are so many choices of logging framework. The mandatory logging dependency in Spring is the Jakarta Commons Logging API (JCL). We compile against JCL and we also make JCL objects visible for classes that extend the Spring Framework. It's important to users that all versions of Spring use the same logging library: migration is easy because backwards compatibility is preserved even with applications that extend Spring. The way we do this is to make one of the modules in Spring depend explicitly on (the canonical implementation of JCL), and then make all the other modules depend on that at compile time. If you are using Maven for example, and wondering where you picked up the dependency on , then it is from Spring and specifically from the central module called . The nice thing about is that you don't need anything else to make your application work. It has a runtime discovery algorithm that looks for other logging frameworks in well known places on the classpath and uses one that it thinks is appropriate (or you can tell it which one if you need to). If nothing else is available you get pretty nice looking logs just from the JDK (java.util.logging or JUL for short). You should find that your Spring application works and logs happily to the console out of the box in most situations, and that's important. Unfortunately, the runtime discovery algorithm in , while convenient for the end-user, is problematic. If we could turn back the clock and start Spring now as a new project it would use a different logging dependency. The first choice would probably be the Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J), which is also used by a lot of other tools that people use with Spring inside their applications. Switching off is easy: just make sure it isn't on the classpath at runtime. In Maven terms you exclude the dependency, and because of the way that the Spring dependencies are declared, you only have to do that once. Now this application is probably broken because there is no implementation of the JCL API on the classpath, so to fix it a new one has to be provided. In the next section we show you how to provide an alternative implementation of JCL using SLF4J as an example. SLF4J is a cleaner dependency and more efficient at runtime than because it uses compile-time bindings instead of runtime discovery of the other logging frameworks it integrates. This also means that you have to be more explicit about what you want to happen at runtime, and declare it or configure it accordingly. SLF4J provides bindings to many common logging frameworks, so you can usually choose one that you already use, and bind to that for configuration and management. SLF4J provides bindings to many common logging frameworks, including JCL, and it also does the reverse: bridges between other logging frameworks and itself. So to use SLF4J with Spring you need to replace the dependency with the SLF4J-JCL bridge. Once you have done that then logging calls from within Spring will be translated into logging calls to the SLF4J API, so if other libraries in your application use that API, then you have a single place to configure and manage logging. A common choice might be to bridge Spring to SLF4J, and then provide explicit binding from SLF4J to Log4J. You need to supply 4 dependencies (and exclude the existing ): the bridge, the SLF4J API, the binding to Log4J, and the Log4J implementation itself. In Maven you would do that like this That might seem like a lot of dependencies just to get some logging. Well it is, but it is optional, and it should behave better than the vanilla with respect to classloader issues, notably if you are in a strict container like an OSGi platform. Allegedly there is also a performance benefit because the bindings are at compile-time not runtime. A more common choice amongst SLF4J users, which uses fewer steps and generates fewer dependencies, is to bind directly to Logback. This removes the extra binding step because Logback implements SLF4J directly, so you only need to depend on two libraries not four ( and ). If you do that you might also need to exclude the slf4j-api dependency from other external dependencies (not Spring), because you only want one version of that API on the classpath. Many people use Log4j as a logging framework for configuration and management purposes. It's efficient and well-established, and in fact it's what we use at runtime when we build and test Spring. Spring also provides some utilities for configuring and initializing Log4j, so it has an optional compile-time dependency on Log4j in some modules. To make Log4j work with the default JCL dependency ( ) all you need to do is put Log4j on the classpath, and provide it with a configuration file ( or in the root of the classpath). So for Maven users this is your dependency declaration: And here's a sample log4j.properties for logging to the console: Many people run their Spring applications in a container that itself provides an implementation of JCL. IBM Websphere Application Server (WAS) is the archetype. This often causes problems, and unfortunately there is no silver bullet solution; simply excluding from your application is not enough in most situations. To be clear about this: the problems reported are usually not with JCL per se, or even with : rather they are to do with binding to another framework (often Log4J). This can fail because changed the way they do the runtime discovery in between the older versions (1.0) found in some containers and the modern versions that most people use now (1.1). Spring does not use any unusual parts of the JCL API, so nothing breaks there, but as soon as Spring or your application tries to do any logging you can find that the bindings to Log4J are not working. In such cases with WAS the easiest thing to do is to invert the class loader hierarchy (IBM calls it \"parent last\") so that the application controls the JCL dependency, not the container. That option isn't always open, but there are plenty of other suggestions in the public domain for alternative approaches, and your mileage may vary depending on the exact version and feature set of the container."

        "document": "Java is often said to be too complicated and to take too long to build simple applications. Nonetheless, Java provides a stable platform with a very mature ecosystem around it, which makes it a wonderful option for developing robust software.\n\nThe Spring Framework, one of the many powerful frameworks in the Java ecosystem, comes with a collection of programming and configuration models with a goal to simplify the development of performant and testable applications in Java.\n\nIn this tutorial, we will take the challenge of building a simple application that will act as a database of software developers using Spring Framework and the Java Persistence API (JPA).\n\nThe application follows a standard MVC architecture. It will have a controller (ContractsController class), views (based on Thymeleaf templates), and a model (a Java map object). For the sake of simplicity, we will use an in-memory database behind JPA to persist data while the application is running.\n\nGetting Started with the Spring Framework Tutorial\n\nTo build a Spring based application, we will need to use one of the following build tools:\n\nIn this tutorial, we will use Maven. If you are not familiar with either of these tools, an easy way to get started is to download the Spring Tool Suite. The suite is dedicated for Spring Framework, and comes with its own Eclipse based IDE.\n\nIn Spring Tool Suite, we create a new project by selecting “Spring Starter Project” from under the “File > New” menu.\n\nOnce a new project has been created, we will need to edit the Maven configuration file, “pom.xml”, and add the following dependencies:\n\nThese listed dependencies will load Spring Boot Web, Thymeleaf, JPA, and H2 (which will serve as our in-memory database). All necessary libraries will be pulled automatically.\n\nTo be able to store information about developers and their skills, we will need to define two entity classes: “Developer” and “Skill”.\n\nBoth of these are defined as plain Java classes with some annotations. By adding “@Entity” before the classes, we are making their instances available to JPA. This will make it easier to store and retrieve instances from the persistent data store when needed. Additionally, the “@Id” and “@GeneratedValue” annotations allow us to indicate the unique ID field for the entity and have its value generated automatically when stored in the database.\n\nAs a developer can have many skills, we can define a simple many-to-many relationship using the “@ManyToMany” annotation.\n\nWith JPA we can define a very useful DeveloperRepository interface and SkillRepository interface, which allow for easy CRUD operations. These interfaces will allow us to access stored developers and skills through simple method calls, such as:\n\nTo create these interfaces, all we need to do is extend the CrudRepository interface.\n\nFunctionality for the the additional method “findByLabel “declared here will be provided automatically by JPA.\n\nNext, we can work on the controller for this application. The controller will map request URIs to view templates and perform all necessary processing in between.\n\nMapping of URIs to methods is done via simple “@RequestMapping” annotations. In this case, every method of the controller is mapped to a URI.\n\nThe model parameter of these methods allows data to be passed to the view. In essence, these are simple maps of keys to values.\n\nEach controller method either returns the name of the Thymeleaf template to be used as view, or a URL in a specific pattern (“redirect: ”) to redirect to. For example, the methods “developer” and “_developersList_” returns the name of a template, while “developersAdd” and “developersAddSkill” return URLs to redirect to.\n\nWithin the controller, the “@Autowired” annotations automatically assigns a valid instance of our defined repository in the corresponding field. This allows access to relevant data from within the controller without having to deal with a lot of boilerplate code.\n\nFinally, we need to define some templates for the views to be generated. For this we are using Thymeleaf, a simple templating engine. The model we used in controller methods is available directly within the templates, i.e. when we enter a contract into “contract” key in a model, we will be able to access the name field as “contract.name” from within the template.\n\nThymeleaf contains some special elements and attributes that control generation of HTML. They are very intuitive and straightforward. For example, to populate the contents of a span element with the name of a skill, all you need to do is define the following attribute (assuming that the key “skill” is defined in the model):\n\nSimilarly to set the “href” attribute of an anchor element, the special attribute “th:href” can be used.\n\nIn our application, we will need two simple templates. For clarity, we will skip all style and class attributes (namely Bootstrap ones) here in the embedded template code.\n\nSpring contains a boot module. This allows us to start the server easily from command line as a command line Java application:\n\nSince we are using an in-memory database, it makes sense to bootstrap the database with some predefined data at launch. That way we will have at least some data in the database when the server is up and running.\n\nSpring is a versatile framework that allows building MVC applications. Building a simple application with Spring is quick and transparent. The application can also be integrated with a database easily using JPA.\n\nThe source code of this entire project is available on GitHub."

        "document": "Guide to API-first development with Spring-Boot and OpenApi In this article we will discuss developing REST APIs conforming to OpenApi Specifications and using the OpenApi code generator tool in Java & Spring Boot environment to generate Rest controllers and domain models. Before we dive into the practical implementation of API-first development with Spring Boot and OpenAPI, let’s establish a foundational understanding of the key concepts that underpin this methodology. The code-first approach, sometimes known as integration-first, treats APIs as tactical implementations. APIs are built to serve a particular purpose or single use case, such as connecting two systems within a larger overall project, or as endpoints that power a user interface. Priority is given to making sure that the API is correct for the given implementation, rather than considering how it could be used on a wider basis. Due to its reduced scope, the code-first approach is typically the fastest way to produce APIs and is also the least burden to maintain. However, this also limits how much value the APIs provide. In their Digital Transformation Report, Google Cloud states that “a healthy minority of enterprises still think of APIs in integration-first terms. This mindset can block these organisations from many of today’s most important business opportunities and impede their ability to adapt to new opportunities that may emerge in the future”. In contrast, the API-First approach places API design at the forefront of the development process. By defining the API’s structure, endpoints, data models, and interactions before writing any code, this methodology promotes a clear shared vision among teams and stakeholders. API-first emerged alongside the growth in popularity of the microservices API design pattern, and is part of the overall paradigm shift towards favouring loosely coupled service-oriented architectures. Now lets compare workflows of “Code-first” and “API-first” approaches:\n\nIn API-First Development, a developer creates the API contract document before the business logic development phase. That document provides a common language among the product stakeholders to evaluate the effort to build, provide timely feedback, create test use cases, document the API, etc. Thus, we can be more agile by either changing the initial design or moving on with it before wasting any time developing the application. An API-first approach to building products provides many benefits, including but not limited to: API-first involves establishing a contract. Creating a contract between services that is followed by teams across an organization allows those teams to work on multiple APIs at the same time. Developers do not have to wait for updates for an API to be released before moving on to the next API. Teams can mock APIs and test API dependencies based on the established API definition. APIs and code can be reused in many different projects. When a development team wants to build a new app, they don’t have to start from scratch which is time-consuming and costly process. API-first design also allows most problems to be solved before any code is even written which helps prevent problems when it is time to integrate APIs with applications. Much of the process of building APIs can be automated using tools that allow import of API definition files. Tools like SwaggerHub can help you with it, and with those files API tools such as API documentation, SDKs, and mock APIs can be auto-generated. Automation significantly speeds up the development of APIs and applications. API-first also makes it possible to add new services and technologies to applications without having to re-architect the entire system. The competition is fierce when it comes to developing applications, so apps must be developed quickly. Today, applications must not only be well designed but also to market within six months. Although API-first development can provide significant benefits, it also comes with some drawbacks. Here are some of the common challenges of implementation the API-first development: API-first development necessitates investing substantial time and effort in API design before any tangible code is produced. This front-loading of work can create challenges for time-sensitive projects or those requiring rapid prototyping. One of the challenges of API-first Development is the complexity of designing an API that meets the needs of both the business and the end-users. API design requires a deep understanding of the business requirements, the system architecture, and the needs of the end-users. It can be difficult to strike the right balance between flexibility, functionality, and simplicity. The API-first approach encourages parallel development between backend and frontend teams. However, effective coordination and communication between these teams are essential. Misalignment in understanding the API contract can result in inefficiencies, discrepancies, and integration challenges down the line. We’ll use a online-shop demo REST API to illustrate an API-First approach workflow. That API allows two operations: get list of products and add a product to the store. To clarify, the table below shows the endpoint paths, HTTP methods, and response codes (RCs) of these operations:\n\nNow, we can create the OAS API Specification file Let’s start by defining the top-level context of the API. To do that, lets create file in root of our project.\n\nThen add the following yaml-code: openapi: 3.0.3\n\ninfo:\n\n title: E-commerce Shop API\n\n description: |-\n\n An e-commerce API that allows various operations related to products, categories, and shopping carts.\n\n version: 1.0-SNAPSHOT\n\nservers:\n\n - url: https://testenvironment.org/api/v1\n\n - url: https://prodenvironment.org/api/v1\n\ntags:\n\n - name: products\n\n description: Operations related to products\n\n - name: categories\n\n description: Operations related to product categories\n\n - name: cart\n\n description: Operations related to shopping carts\n• openapi — The version of OAS used.\n• version — The current version of the API, for instance, 1.0-SNAPSHOT.\n• servers — The available machines where the client can access the API.\n• tags — A set of unique tags to group API operations in sub-sets. Now, let’s create the GET and POST /products API endpoints described earlier. To do that, add the following content at the root level of the YAML editor: paths:\n\n /products:\n\n get:\n\n summary: Get a list of products\n\n responses:\n\n '200':\n\n description: Audit scores data\n\n content:\n\n application/json:\n\n schema:\n\n type: array\n\n items:\n\n $ref: '#/components/schemas/Product'\n\n post:\n\n summary: Add a product to the store\n\n requestBody:\n\n description: Product details\n\n required: true\n\n content:\n\n application/json:\n\n schema:\n\n $ref: '#/components/schemas/Product'\n\n responses:\n\n '201':\n\n description: Created product\n\n '400':\n\n description: Product already exists The content above contains a lot of details. Let’s simplify it by examining each keyword individually:\n• paths — Specifies API resources like “/account” and “/account/deposit”. For each resource, we define the available “get” and “post” verbs.\n• tags — Identifies the group an endpoint belongs to. The tag name should match the one mentioned in the previous section.\n• summary — Offers a brief overview of what the endpoint accomplishes.\n• description — Provides a more comprehensive explanation of how the endpoint functions.\n• operationId — Serves as a unique identifier for the described operation.\n• requestBody — Describes the payload in the request, including its content and whether it’s required. The content schema will be detailed in the next section\n• responses — Lists all available response codes. Each response code object includes a description and content keywords. The content schema will be defined in the upcoming section.\n• content — Indicates the HTTP Content-Type of the message being exchanged. Now let’s create the data model objects of our API: the request and response bodies and the error messages. To accomplish that, add the following structure at the root level of the : Let’s check the keywords in the code individually:\n• type — The type of the field. If we use the object type, we must also define the properties keyword.\n• properties — A list of all object field names and their types. This section shows how the developer can import the YAML document into the application and auto-generate the API skeleton code. Update the with appropriate dependencies as show in the below snippet. Run the maven build with command . This will execute the plugin during the goal and server stub classes i.e controllers, models, configuration and spring boot main application will be generated in the directory as configured in the plugin Need to update file with the following: Make sure to update , , and to satisfy requirments of your project. 4. To generate classes you can execute command Now we can proceed with some advanced configurations, which will allow us to define some enhanced behavior for the codegen plugin. With the above configuration, you should have a simple setup with the OpenApi code generator working. But what about the use cases when the generated classes are missing a few details that you want them to have? The good news is that the code generation tooling is quite flexible and allows the users to customize the code generation with the help of custom generators and templating. For most common use cases, customization via templating serves the purpose. Let’s consider a use case where we want to protect one of our endpoints with the help of spring security annotation , and want to have the flexibility of specifying the security role in the API file itself. This way, the engineer or architect who is designing the contract, has the liberty to make a few decisions on the security front as well, which gets passed to the developers for further implementation. To implement this, we need to follow the below steps -\n• Find the relevant file from the the OpenApi Github repository. In our case, we are using java-spring generator and we want to customize the api controller template, so the relevant file for us would be under the directory . Here is the link that points to this specific file on Github.\n• We need to copy this file and paste it somewhere in our project, lets say we keep it at .\n• Update the mustache file with the needed customization. In our case, we want to have a annotation generated on top of the endpoint methods and with the role which we will pass in the contract yml file. We will be using , which is an implicit object for the code generator. Here is what we will add in the mustache file - is going to be the custom attribute that we will be using in api contract yml file. Any custom attribute with prefix becomes accessible to object during code generation. Here is a gist that shows the complete mustache file after the update. Next, we need to use the custom attribute in contract yml as shown below -\n• Now we need to update the code generator plugin configuration in to point it to the custom template directory where we have kept the customized copy of and now function look like following: With all these changes, when you run the maven build on this project, you can see that the has the annotation with role inside it. There are other ways of customizing the code generation while using open api code generator, such as writing a custom code generator by extending the original apis. Writing a custom code generator is a more involved process and should be done only when the requirement is significantly complex and cannot be addressed with templating.

Front-enders can use similar generator plugin to generate clients and types automatically. On this website, it is possible to check a list with a lot of client generators for multiple technologies and programming languages."

        "document": "Every developer must understand two things:\n• Fancy architecture diagrams don’t describe the real architecture of an application.\n\nThe real architecture is found from the code that is written by developers, and if we don’t design the architecture of our application, we will end up with an application that has more than one architecture.\n\nDoes this mean that developers should be ruled by architects?\n\nNo. Architecture design is far too important to be left to the architects, and that is why every developer, who wants to be more than just a type writer, must be good at it.\n\nLet’s start our journey by taking a look at the two principles that will help us to design a better and a simpler architecture for our Spring powered web application.\n\nThe Two Pillars of a Good Architecture\n\nArchitecture design can feel like an overwhelming task. The reason for this is that many developers are taught to believe that architecture design must be done by people who are guardians of a mystical wisdom. These people are called software architects.\n\nHowever, the task itself isn’t so complicated than it sounds:\n\nAlthough it is true that experience helps us to create better architectures, the basic tools of an architecture design are actually quite simple. All we have to do is to follow these two principles:\n\nThe Separation of Concerns (SoC) principle is specified as follows:\n\nThis means that we should\n• Identify the \"concerns\" that we need to take care of.\n• Decide where we want to handle them.\n\nIn other words, this principle will help us the identify the required layers and the responsibilities of each layer.\n\n2. The Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS) principle\n\nThe Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS) principle states that:\n\nThis principle is the voice of reason. It reminds us that every layer has a price, and if we create a complex architecture that has too many layers, that price will be too high.\n\nIn other words, we should not design an architecture like this:\n\nI think that John, Judy, Marc, and David are guilty of mental masturbation. They followed the separation of concerns principle, but they forgot to minimize the complexity of their architecture. Sadly, this is a common mistake, and its price is high:\n• Adding new features takes a lot longer than it should because we have to transfer information through every layer.\n• Maintaining the application is impossible because no one really understands the architecture, and the ad-hoc decisions, that are made every, will pile up until our code base looks like a big pile of shit that has ten layers.\n\nWhat kind of an architecture could serve us well?\n\nThree Layers Should Be Enough for Everybody\n\nIf think about the responsibilities of a web application, we notice that a web application has the following \"concerns\":\n• It needs to process the user's input and return the correct response back to the user.\n• It needs an exception handling mechanism that provides reasonable error messages to the user.\n• It needs to handle both authentication and authorization.\n• It needs to implement the business logic of the application.\n• It needs to communicate with the used data storage and other external resources.\n\nWe can fulfil all these concerns by using \"only\" three layers. These layers are:\n• The web layer is the uppermost layer of a web application. It is responsible of processing user’s input and returning the correct response back to the user. The web layer must also handle the exceptions thrown by the other layers. Because the web layer is the entry point of our application, it must take care of authentication and act as a first line of defense against unauthorized users.\n• The service layer resides below the web layer. It acts as a transaction boundary and contains both application and infrastructure services. The application services provides the public API of the service layer. They also act as a transaction boundary and are responsible of authorization. The infrastructure services contain the \"plumbing code\" that communicates with external resources such as file systems, databases, or email servers. Often these methods are used by more than a one application service.\n• The repository layer is the lowest layer of a web application. It is responsible of communicating with the used data storage.\n\nThe components that belong to a specific layer can use the components that belong to the same layer or to the layer below it.\n\nThe high level architecture of a classic Spring web application looks as follows:\n\nThe next thing that we have to do is to design the interface of each layer, and this is the phase where we run into terms like data transfer object (DTO) and domain model. These terms are described in the following:\n• A data transfer object is an object that is just a simple data container, and these objects are used to carry data between different processes and between the layers of our application.\n• A domain model consists of three different objects:\n• A domain service is a stateless class that provides operations which are related to a domain concept but aren’t a “natural” part of an entity or a value object.\n• An entity is an object that is defined by its identity which stays unchanged through its entire lifecycle.\n• A value object describes a property or a thing, and these objects don’t have their own identity or lifecycle. The lifecycle of a value object is bound to the lifecycle of an entity.\n\nNow that we know what these terms mean, we can move on and design the interface of each layer. Let’s go through our layers one by one:\n• The web layer should handle only data transfer objects.\n• The service layer takes data transfer objects (and basic types) as method parameters. It can handle domain model objects but it can return only data transfer objects back to the web layer.\n• The repository layer takes entities (and basic types) as method parameters and returns entities (and basic types).\n\nThis raises one very important question:\n\nThere are two reasons why this is a bad idea:\n• The domain model specifies the internal model of our application. If we expose this model to the outside world, the clients would have to know how to use it. In other words, the clients of our application would have to take care of things that don’t belong to them. If we use DTOs, we can hide this model from the clients of our application, and provide an easier and cleaner API.\n• If we expose our domain model to the outside world, we cannot change it without breaking the other stuff that depends from it. If we use DTOs, we can change our domain model as long as we don’t make any changes to the DTOs.\n\nThe \"final\" architecture of a classic Spring web application looks as follows:\n\nThere Are Many Unanswered Questions Left\n\nThis blog post described the classic architecture of a Spring web application, but it doesn’t provide any answers to the really interesting questions such as:\n• Why the layer X is responsible of the concern Y?\n• Should our application have more than three or less than three layers?\n• How should we design the internal structure of each layer?\n• Do we really need layers?\n\nThe reason for this is simple:\n\nWe must learn to walk before we can run.\n\nThe next blog posts of this tutorial will answer to these questions."
