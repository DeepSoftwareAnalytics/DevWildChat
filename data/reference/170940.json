If that is the case, the users computers were never \"infected\" with anything.\n\nIt is extremely common these days for websites to load tons of third party scripts and cookies in the background and do hundreds of things you are not aware of every time you use the internet. Most sites load a Google Analytics tracking script when you visit them, even though you did not authorize them to do that. But that would not be considered malware. Most sites load persistent third-party cookies that track your presence from one website to another and create a massive profile of your online habits. This is why you could be shopping for shoes on one site, and then suddenly find that Facebook is serving you ads for shoes. But that also is generally not considered malware.\n\nIn terms of \"harm\" or \"unwanted activity\", persistent tracking could be said to be more invasive than a coin mining script. The coin mining script is probably just using some of the memory and CPU power of the end user's computer, which is no different from the hundreds of other javascript libraries that are getting loaded in the background without your knowledge."

        "document": "This week, I played around with the recently released Coin Hive JavaScript coin miner, and got slammed for it. However, I think that people are missing the point.\n\nThe old argument is that the content on the internet needs paying for. Long gone are the days where everything is created by enthusiasts and people messing around in their spare time. Today’s content and platforms are high-quality and expensive to produce, and at the moment we’ve really only got three models to pay for it:\n• Subscription or pay-per-content. You want it? Open your wallet — subscription models are becoming more popular for the high-end content such as video and music, and that’s great. But it doesn’t really trickle down to things that you don’t really think you should be paying for, stuff that doesn’t have that real, tangible sense of value. Sure I’ll subscribe to Google Play Music, Amazon Prime, and Strava, but would I pay per month to use Twitter? No.\n• Ads and marketing\n\nYou’re the product that’s being sold here, have no illusions. Hope you like ads. You’re targeted within 10 feet of your location and everyone knows what mood you’re currently in, and if you’re planning to buy a toaster or a coffee in the next ten minutes. Feeling a little grubby?\n• Donations. That thing you’ll get around to next time.\n\nSo, now there’s the idea of a fourth option. A bit of code runs in the website, extension, or app that you’re making good use of, and quietly and unobtrusively uses some of your CPU cycles to make a bit of money for it’s creator. You get the content ad-free, they get paid — this is what coin mining in browser could lead to.\n\nNow, there’s an option to have a business model without advertising in mind. A model that isn’t trying to squeeze every little last drop of revenue out of you, because the money is being earned by you being on the site. The miner doesn’t care who you are or what shopping mood you’re in, it just get’s on and mines a tiny fraction of a given crypto-currency.\n\nIs that so bad? Apparently people think so.\n\nThis is from two genuine reviews of an extension we tried this over the week. These got posted once it was published on Reddit that it contained the miner — something that we had put in the description of the extension from the very beginning.\n\nNo addon? I use a few that make my workday easier because of what their authors have created, and I try to donate or pay when I can. What if I didn’t have to, because every hour I had their tool open in the browser, it earned them money? What about websites, does the same apply here if they can offer me an advert-free, tracking free experience?\n\nIs that any difference between someone taking up your screen space to show you adverts? That just about defines all brand-awareness advert campaigns.\n\nI’m not going to say here that this technology won’t have it’s problems. People will abuse it, and because of this others will distrust it. I personally learned about it after reading what The Pirate Bay did a weekend ago. The reaction to that where news articles that included the words ‘hidden’ and ‘secretly’, not a great first impression made to the world.\n\nBut, I’m not going to say that this is a bad technology ether. The idea of an advert free web, and a more anonymous web because of that, is something that we should be excited about.\n\nLet’s not stamp on ways that content creators can earn enough to pay the bills."

        "document": "In today’s digital landscape, where web applications play a pivotal role in various aspects of our lives, security is paramount. JavaScript, being one of the most widely used programming languages for web development, demands special attention when it comes to safeguarding against potential vulnerabilities and threats. In this comprehensive guide, we’ll delve into the best practices for JavaScript security to ensure the robustness and integrity of your web applications.\n• Input Validation: Always validate user input on both client and server sides to prevent injection attacks such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Utilize frameworks or libraries that offer built-in validation mechanisms.\n• Output Encoding: Encode user-generated content before rendering it in the browser to mitigate XSS attacks. Employ functions like or escaping to sanitize user inputs.\n• Avoid Eval: Avoid using the function as it can execute arbitrary code and pose a significant security risk. Instead, opt for alternative approaches like or constructor.\n• Principle of Least Privilege: Follow the principle of least privilege by granting only the necessary permissions and access rights to different components of your application. Limit the scope of user privileges to minimize potential damage in case of a breach.\n• Use HTTPS: Ensure all communication between the client and server is encrypted using HTTPS to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. Obtain SSL/TLS certificates from trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) to establish secure connections.\n• Secure Authentication: Implement secure authentication mechanisms such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), OAuth, or JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to verify the identity of users and protect against credential-based attacks like brute force or credential stuffing.\n• Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Enforce role-based access control to regulate user permissions based on their roles and responsibilities within the application. Restrict access to sensitive functionalities or data to authorized users only.\n• Dependency Management: Regularly update and patch dependencies, including libraries, frameworks, and third-party modules, to address known security vulnerabilities and mitigate the risk of exploitation. Utilize package managers like npm or Yarn to manage dependencies efficiently.\n• Dependency Monitoring: Monitor security advisories and alerts for your project’s dependencies using tools like npm audit or Snyk. Set up automated alerts for vulnerability disclosures and promptly apply patches or upgrades to vulnerable dependencies.\n• Data Sanitization: Sanitize user inputs, including form submissions, URL parameters, and cookies, to remove potentially malicious content and prevent injection attacks. Utilize libraries like DOMPurify or validator.js for robust data sanitization.\n• Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement Content Security Policy headers to define the trusted sources of content and mitigate risks associated with XSS attacks. Specify allowed content sources, such as scripts, stylesheets, and images, to prevent unauthorized execution of malicious scripts.\n• CORS Configuration: Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies to control access to resources from different origins and prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests. Specify allowed origins, methods, and headers using server-side configurations or middleware.\n• Penetration Testing: Conduct regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments to identify and address security weaknesses in your web application. Utilize automated scanning tools, such as OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite, along with manual testing techniques to uncover vulnerabilities.\n• Code Reviews: Perform thorough code reviews to identify security flaws, vulnerabilities, and coding errors early in the development lifecycle. Encourage collaboration among developers and security experts to ensure the integrity and resilience of your codebase.\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of web development, prioritizing security is paramount to safeguarding your web applications and protecting sensitive data. By adhering to robust JavaScript security best practices, such as embracing secure coding practices, implementing strong authentication and authorization mechanisms, keeping dependencies up-to-date, sanitizing and validating data, enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) safely, and conducting regular security testing and auditing, you can fortify your web applications against potential vulnerabilities and threats.\n\nAt Emperor Brains, we understand the critical importance of security in web development.

        "document": "JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages, largely because it’s an easy language for beginners. It’s easy to set up, it has an active and vast community, and users can create web, mobile, and desktop applications using only JavaScript. But as with any programming language, bad actors try to find vulnerabilities to exploit within JavaScript applications. Common vulnerabilities include cross-site scripting, sensitive data disclosure, broken access control, session hijacking, CSRF and man-in-the-middle attacks. This blog post presents JavaScript security best practices for securing your applications.\n\n2. Evaluate the need of third-party libraries Code reuse is seen as a good practice, and JavaScript developers have pushed this idea to the extreme, creating packages even for the simplest tasks. But reusing packages in a noncontrolled way exposes JavaScript applications to issues and security threats. Consider treating dependencies as code needed for the project to run. The more that is needed, the more points of failures there can be. The following story illustrates the point. On March 22, 2016, a commonly used package implementing a basic left-pad string function (with only 12 lines of code) was deleted. The dependency chain reaction of deleting this seemingly innocent and simple package broke a big chunk of the web development ecosystem including React, Babel, and other high-profile packages. The moral to this story is that a project is as weak as its weakest dependency. By using well-known secure libraries and frameworks, you are protecting yourself. When using less-known third-party packages, inspect who has developed it; whether the package is maintained, inactive, and well-tested; and if it has unpatched vulnerabilities. And make sure you’re installing the right package—typosquatting attacks, where malicious packages with similar names to well-known packages make their way into real applications, are common. You should also use software composition analysis (SCA) tools to help you to detect open source license violations, vulnerabilities, and out-of-date dependencies in open source software. Black Duck® SCA is a software composition analysis tool that helps you with detecting these issues.\n\nMost web applications allow users to insert data through text input. After the data is inserted, it is reflected somewhere in the web application. But accepting and displaying inputs from users opens the door to cross-site scripting attacks in which cybercriminals use special characters to trick browsers into interpreting text as HTML markup or JavaScript code. Output encoding transforms potentially dangerous characters into a safe form. The encoding mechanism to use depends on where the untrusted input data is placed. Some of the encoding that the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) recognizes are HTML entity encoding, HTML attribute encoding, URL encoding, JavaScript string encoding, and CSS Hex. Since the type of encoding to use depends on where the input data is placed, the best option is to leave these contextual encodings to the framework you are using. If you’re not using a framework, OWASP recommends using a security-focused encoding library to make sure that encodings are implemented properly. When a web application needs to accept HTML inserted by the user, sanitize the input before displaying it on a page or sending it to other systems. HTML sanitization involves validating the input and cleaning up unexpected characters. The outcome should be a safe HTML version of the HTML input. An excellent tool to sanitize HTML is DOMPurify. To reduce cross-site scripting attacks, sanitize inputs in addition to applying output encoding.\n\nJSON is a commonly used syntax for exchanging information between applications. It is simple; compact; easy to learn, read, and understand; and has a hierarchical structure. An injection attack is when an attacker supplies untrusted input, without validation or sanitization, to a program or application. A JSON injection attack can impact the server side or client side. For example, when code on the server side builds a JSON object from a string, and the string is built by concatenating some inputs provided by the user. Simple string concatenation, without validation or sanitization, opens the door for exfiltration of sensitive information or misbehavior. On the client side, this type of attack can lead to cross-site scripting if the concatenated string runs inside functions that evaluate code such as eval, Function, or setTimeout, among others. For example \n\n ```\n\n // location: http://my-website.com/view?username=ENTER_USERNAME\n\n const params = new URLSearchParams(document.location.search);\n\n \n\n // Get input from search param. Input is not validated or sanitized \n\n const usernameFromQueryParams=params.get('username');\n\n \n\n // Create JSON object string from user input\n\n const bannerJSONAsString = `{ \"greetings\": \"Hello ${usernameFromQueryParams}\"}`\n\n \n\n // Use of function that evaluate string as code\n\n const result = eval(\"(\" + bannerJSONAsString + \")\");\n\n document.getElementById(\"#banner\").innerText = result. greetings; In this example, an attacker could alert user cookies by injecting To defend against this attack vector, validate and sanitize untrusted input, avoid using functions that evaluate strings as code, use the JSON.parse() function instead of eval() to parse JSON strings, and set content security policy to restrict the use of functions that evaluate strings as code.\n\nHTTP cookies are used to preserve information such as authentication or session tokens, user preferences, or anything that the server should remember between requests. A HTTP cookie is a small string of data that the web server sends to the browser using the Set-Cookie HTTP header in the response. After this, the browser will automatically send the cookie back on almost every request (to the same domain) using the Cookie HTTP header. If you do not set any flags, the cookie content is accessible programmatically using document.cookie. This is not always desirable. If an attacker is able to inject JavaScript within a web application, the script could read the content of document.cookie, and that could enable the bad actor to access any sensitive information in the cookie. There are a variety of ways to protect cookies. If the cookie is used only by the webserver, you can use the httpOnly flag to restrict programmatical access to the cookie’s content. HTTP does not encrypt messages, so man-in-the-middle attacks could succeed, and messages could be intercepted. If the cookie holds sensitive information, restrict the browser from sending it over unencrypted HTTP connections. Use the secure flag to instruct the browser to send cookies only through HTTPS, a protocol extension of HTTP. If you do not use this flag, the browser will send the cookie using both secure (https://my-secure-site.com) and insecure (http://my-secure-site.com) connections to a site. In the case of a cross-site request forgery attacks, attackers can succeed because web applications can’t differentiate between valid requests and forged requests. For example, say you have a form for updating a user's password, and the website uses cookies for handling sessions. An attacker could create a page that automatically sends a request to update your password. If cookies aren’t protected and you have a valid session cookie, when you visit this site, a request to update your password is sent from the site. Since your session cookie is valid, the browser will automatically include the cookie in the request. With this information, the webserver receives a request with a valid session cookie and updates the password. Thus, an attacker can reset your password to the value of their choice. To protect your cookies against cross-site request forgery attacks, use the cookie flag samesite=strict to ensure that the cookie is not sent when the request comes from another domain than the site that sets the cookie.\n\nJavaScript is a prototype-based language. When an object is created, it inherits all properties and methods following the so-called prototype chain. As it is a chain, prototypes have references to other prototypes. The chain is followed until reaching null. The Object prototype sits just below null in this prototype chain. Almost all objects in JavaScript are instances of Object. When someone targets Object and alters the methods that most objects in JavaScript inherit through the prototype chain, this is called prototype pollution attack. It can happen in the server side or client side, and its consequences can include remote code execution, cross-site scripting, and denial-of-service attacks. On the client side, an attacker injects code that can modify the Object.prototype directly. On the server side, the application is if it recursively clones object properties or if it sets object properties through a given path. If we have an HTTP server accepting HTTP requests, an attacker could send an HTTP request payload that contains a JSON object that tries to exploit the _proto_, constructor, or prototype properties. There are different ways to mitigate prototype pollution attacks.\n• Freeze `Object.prototype` to prevent the default prototype from getting polluted. ```\n\n // This should be executed only once\n\n Object.freeze(Object.prototype);\n\n \n\n clone(source, target);\n\n ```\n• Create prototypeless objects using Object.create(null). These types of objects do not have a prototype. As such, they do not inherit methods from Object.prototype.\n• Use Map instead of Object.\n\nOften, web pages present information to users by opening other windows or iframes. Sometimes these windows and iframes require communication between each other. But enabling communication between pages from different subdomains by setting the same value for document.domain on both pages should be avoided as it weakens the security protections provided by the same-origin policy. Instead, the window.postMessage() method should be used. The window.postMessage() method enables safe communication between window objects such as a page and a pop-up or with an iframe. It allows two windows to share messages without one having any direct control over the other one. Although it’s a safer method, you must be careful with how you use it. For instance, window.postMessage() accepts a targetOrigin parameter, but you should avoid using * as the targetOrigin and make sure that the URL you provide uses HTTPS. The window receiving the message should always verify the sender's identity (by checking message origin), as well as validate the received message. Do not execute strings coming through the window.postMessage() method to run as code, and avoid listening on message events if you are not expecting them.\n\nWhen a user enters a URL in their browser and hits the enter button, the result is a mixture of HTML, CSS, images, fonts, and some other bits on the user screen. All these pieces come to the browser because it downloads the content from other systems. Sometimes it can all happen on the very first request. Other times CSS, images, fonts, and JavaScript libraries are downloaded as subsequent requests. Bad actors try to get into the communication channel to gain access to sensitive data, intercept communication, or modify data while it’s in transit. These attacks can be minimized by securing the communications using HTTPS instead of HTTP. When using HTTP, the transmitted data is not encrypted. This means that an attacker could potentially intercept the transmitted data. When using HTTPS, the communication is encrypted using TLS or SSL protocol, which uses digital certificates for verifying the identity of the server and encrypts the communication between network devices. Using SSL/TLS certificates ensures privacy and data integrity in the communication. Even if encrypted data is intercepted, it cannot be decrypted without access to the secret key. Use HTTPS for all requests to secure communications between network devices."

Look no further! PromptCloud offers ethical and reliable web scraping services tailored to your needs. Connect with us at sales@promptcloud.com to transform raw data into actionable intelligence. Let’s enhance your decision-making together!\n\nIs it acceptable to scrape data from websites?\n\nAbsolutely, data scraping is okay, but you’ve got to play by the rules. Before diving into any scraping adventures, take a good look at the terms of service and robots.txt file of the website in question. Showing some respect for the website’s layout, sticking to frequency limits, and keeping things ethical are all key to responsible data scraping practices.\n\nHow can I extract user data from a website through scraping?\n\nExtracting user data through scraping requires a meticulous approach in alignment with legal and ethical norms. Whenever feasible, leveraging publicly available APIs provided by the website is recommended for data retrieval. In the absence of an API, it is imperative to ensure that the scraping methods employed adhere to privacy laws, terms of use, and the policies set forth by the website to mitigate potential legal ramifications\n\nThe legality of web scraping is contingent upon several factors, including the purpose, methodology, and compliance with pertinent laws. While web scraping itself is not inherently illegal, unauthorized access, violation of a website’s terms of service, or disregard for privacy laws may lead to legal consequences. Responsible and ethical conduct in web scraping activities is paramount, involving a keen awareness of legal boundaries and ethical considerations.\n\nWebsites have implemented mechanisms to detect and prevent web scraping activities, monitoring elements such as user-agent strings, IP addresses, and request patterns. To mitigate detection, best practices include employing techniques like rotating user agents, utilizing proxies, and implementing randomized delays between requests. However, it is crucial to note that attempts to circumvent detection measures may violate a website’s terms of service and potentially result in legal consequences. Responsible and ethical web scraping practices prioritize transparency and adherence to legal and ethical standards."

For example, the data in the email text field should be a valid email address, and the data in the username text field should follow the expected username structure.\n\nSanitization cleans this input by stripping out any malicious data that could be used in attacks such as XSS and SQL injection. These two are critical security measures for any web app, and they serve as the first line of defense against malicious data that users might input.\n\nHow to implement input validation and sanitization\n\nClient-side form validation is the initial check of the data validation process. However, this should never be solely relied upon for security purposes because JavaScript can be disabled or manipulated, easily bypassing client-side checks.\n\nRefer to the following code example of basic client-side validation using HTML 5.\n\nFor a more comprehensive look at client-side form validation, explore this detailed guide.\n\nServer-side validation ensures that all inputs are validated, regardless of the client-side validation status. It increases security by ensuring that malicious data never reaches your core app logic or database validation on the server. It is also less vulnerable to tampering.\n\nRefer to the following code example of basic server-side validation using Node.js with Express.\n\nSanitization ensures that any potentially harmful data is removed or altered to a safe format. The following code example sanitizes input using the validator library in Node.js.\n\nThis is a strong security solution to guard web apps against threats such as XSS and data injection. Implementing CSP ensures that only scripts from specific, approved sources can run on your web pages. This significantly reduces the chance of malicious code execution.\n\nIn simpler terms, think of CSP as a bouncer for your web app. It checks where the scripts come from and only lets in those from trusted sources, keeping the bad scripts out.\n\nImplementing CSP involves adding CSP directives to your web server’s HTTP response header. CSP directives are instructions that tell the browser which sources are permitted to load and execute content on a webpage. These directives provide granular control over various types of resources.\n\nHow to add CSP to the HTTP response header\n\nYou can add the CSP to the HTTP response header via your web server configuration. Refer to the following code example for setting up CSP in the Apache server.\n\nFor Nginx, you can configure CSP as follows.\n\nHow to add your CSP via meta tags\n\nIf you cannot access the web server’s configuration, you can include the CSP directly in your HTML file using a <meta> tag. But this is not the recommended way.\n\nThis security feature helps browsers check if the resources obtained from a third party (for instance, a CDN) have been modified. It allows you to provide a cryptographic hash for these resources.\n\nWhen the browser gets the resource, it compares its hash to the given hash. If the hash does not match, the resources will not be loaded, thereby protecting your app from malicious modifications.\n\nImplementing SRI involves adding a cryptographic hash to the integrity attribute of your <script> or <link> tags. Here’s a step-by-step guide to setting up SRI:\n\nYou must generate a hash for the resource you want to include in your webpage. This can be done using a tool or online service like the Subresource Integrity Generator tool.\n\nStep 2: Adding the hash to your resource\n\nOnce you have the hash, add it to the integrity attribute of the <script> or <link> tag.\n\nRefer to the following code example.\n\nIn this example, the integrity attribute contains the hash, and the crossorigin=”anonymous” attribute ensures the resource is fetched with CORS (cross-origin resource sharing).\n\nYou can use SRI for stylesheets, as well.\n\nSecure JavaScript coding practices are crucial for developing web apps robust against various attacks, XSS, and other malicious exploits. By following these best practices, developers can ensure their code is secure, maintainable, and less vulnerable to unauthorized execution.\n\nThe eval() function is a significant security risk, as it executes a string of code, potentially allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts. Always avoid using eval() and similar functions like setTimeout(string) and setInterval(string).\n\nWhy these functions are dangerous:\n• Arbitrary code execution: These functions can execute any code passed to them as a string. If an attacker successfully inserts a malicious string, it will operate in the same way as the remaining code of your script.\n• Difficulty in code analysis: Using these functions makes it harder to analyze the code for security vulnerabilities. Static analysis tools cannot examine the strings that are passed through such functions.\n• Dynamic code injection: Attackers can use these functions to inject and execute code dynamically that was not originally part of the app, bypassing traditional security measures.\n\nEnabling strict mode in JavaScript helps catch common coding mistakes and unsafe actions, such as assigning values to undeclared variables. This improves the security and stability of your code. To enable strict mode, add “use strict”; at the beginning of a script or a function.\n• In strict mode, this is undefined in functions that are not called methods.\n• Strict mode will throw an error if a function has duplicate parameter names or an object literal has duplicate property names.\n• A with statement is not allowed in the strict mode because it makes code difficult to predict and optimize.\n\nRefer to the following code example.\n\nInline JavaScript can be significantly vulnerable to XSS attacks because it allows attackers to inject malicious scripts directly into your HTML. Instead, use external scripts to ensure all JavaScript is properly vetted and sanitized.\n• Ease of injection: Inline JavaScript is more susceptible to injection attacks because it is part of the HTML content.\n• CSP compliance: Content security policies (CSP) can be more effectively enforced when JavaScript is kept in external files. Inline scripts often require the use of the unsafe-inline directive, which weakens CSP’s effectiveness.\n• Maintainability: Keeping JavaScript in separate files makes the codebase easier to manage and maintain.\n\nRefer to the following code example.\n\nRegular audits are essential for maintaining the integrity and security of web apps. By continuously assessing your app’s security, you can identify and fix vulnerabilities that could be exploited to execute unauthorized JavaScript or other malicious actions.\n\nUse tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite to scan for known vulnerabilities. Automated scans provide a quick way to identify common security issues.\n\nRegularly review your codebase manually to catch issues that automated tools might miss. It’s better to use experienced developers and security experts for this.\n\nHire penetration testers to simulate attacks on your app, uncovering vulnerabilities that other methods might not detect.\n\nKeep your dependencies updated to fix known vulnerabilities in libraries and frameworks. Use package managers like NPM or pip to manage updates.\n\nContinuously train your development team on the latest security practices and common vulnerabilities. This will ensure that your team is equipped to write secure code.\n\nThanks for reading this article.
