        "document": "The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for making HTTP requests and processing the responses. Fetch is the modern replacement for : unlike , which uses callbacks, Fetch is promise-based and is integrated with features of the modern web such as service workers and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). With the Fetch API, you make a request by calling , which is available as a global function in both and contexts. You pass it a object or a string containing the URL to fetch, along with an optional argument to configure the request. The function returns a which is fulfilled with a object representing the server's response. You can then check the request status and extract the body of the response in various formats, including text and JSON, by calling the appropriate method on the response. Here's a minimal function that uses to retrieve some JSON data from a server: async function getData() { const url = \"https://example.org/products.json\"; try { const response = await fetch(url); if (!response.ok) { throw new Error(`Response status: ${response.status}`); } const json = await response.json(); console.log(json); } catch (error) { console.error(error.message); } } We declare a string containing the URL and then call , passing the URL with no extra options. The function will reject the promise on some errors, but not if the server responds with an error status like : so we also check the response status and throw if it is not OK. Otherwise, we fetch the response body content as JSON by calling the method of , and log one of its values. Note that like itself, is asynchronous, as are all the other methods to access the response body content. In the rest of this page we'll look in more detail at the different stages of this process.\n\nThe request body is the payload of the request: it's the thing the client is sending to the server. You cannot include a body with requests, but it's useful for requests that send content to the server, such as or requests. For example, if you want to upload a file to the server, you might make a request and include the file as the request body. To set a request body, pass it as the option: You can supply the body as an instance of any of the following types: Other objects are converted to strings using their method. For example, you can use a object to encode form data (see setting headers for more information): const response = await fetch(\"https://example.org/post\", { method: \"POST\", headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\", }, // Automatically converted to \"username=example&password=password\" body: new URLSearchParams({ username: \"example\", password: \"password\" }), // ... }); Note that just like response bodies, request bodies are streams, and making the request reads the stream, so if a request contains a body, you can't make it twice: const request = new Request(\"https://example.org/post\", { method: \"POST\", body: JSON.stringify({ username: \"example\" }), }); const response1 = await fetch(request); console.log(response1.status); // Will throw: \"Body has already been consumed.\" const response2 = await fetch(request); console.log(response2.status); Instead, you would need to create a clone of the request before sending it: See Locked and disturbed streams for more information.\n\nCredentials are cookies, TLS client certificates, or authentication headers containing a username and password. To control whether or not the browser sends credentials, as well as whether the browser respects any response headers, set the option, which can take one of the following three values:\n• : never send credentials in the request or include credentials in the response.\n• (the default): only send and include credentials for same-origin requests. Note that if a cookie's attribute is set to or , then the cookie will not be sent cross-site, even if is set to . Including credentials in cross-origin requests can make a site vulnerable to CSRF attacks, so even if is set to , the server must also agree to their inclusion by including the header in its response. Additionally, in this situation the server must explicitly specify the client's origin in the response header (that is, is not allowed). This means that if is set to and the request is cross-origin, then:\n• If the request is a simple request, then the request will be sent with credentials, but the server must set the and response headers, or the browser will return a network error to the caller. If the server does set the correct headers, then the response, including credentials, will be delivered to the caller.\n• If the request is not a simple request, then the browser will send a preflighted request without credentials, and the server must set the and response headers, or the browser will return a network error to the caller. If the server does set the correct headers, then the browser will follow up with the real request, including credentials, and will deliver the real response, including credentials, to the caller.\n\nRequest and response bodies are actually objects, and whenever you read them, you're streaming the content. This is good for memory efficiency, because the browser doesn't have to buffer the entire response in memory before the caller retrieves it using a method like . This also means that the caller can process the content incrementally as it is received. For example, consider a request that fetches a large text file and processes it in some way, or displays it to the user: const url = \"https://www.example.org/a-large-file.txt\"; async function fetchText(url) { try { const response = await fetch(url); if (!response.ok) { throw new Error(`Response status: ${response.status}`); } const text = await response.text(); console.log(text); } catch (e) { console.error(e); } } If we use , as above, we must wait until the whole file has been received before we can process any of it. If we stream the response instead, we can process chunks of the body as they are received from the network: const url = \"https://www.example.org/a-large-file.txt\"; async function fetchTextAsStream(url) { try { const response = await fetch(url); if (!response.ok) { throw new Error(`Response status: ${response.status}`); } const stream = response.body.pipeThrough(new TextDecoderStream()); for await (const value of stream) { console.log(value); } } catch (e) { console.error(e); } } In this example, we iterate asynchronously over the stream, processing each chunk as it arrives. Note that when you access the body directly like this, you get the raw bytes of the response and must transform it yourself. In this case we call to pipe the response through a , which decodes the UTF-8-encoded body data as text."

Also as other answers suggest that the Content-Type header needs to be correct.

You can fetch (or retrieve) data, submit data, update existing data, and more. And all of this comes in a more powerful, flexible, and cleaner package than . When making these requests, we primarily deal with four types of HTTP methods, although there are several more:\n• GET: For retrieving data from the server. It doesn't change the server state.\n• POST: For sending data to the server, typically resulting in a change on the server.\n• PUT: For replacing a current resource with a new one. Note that the code samples below use for simplicity. If you don't want to use , you can change these examples to use the pattern. For a GET request, try this: In this block, we're retrieving data and making it available under the variable . For POSTing JSON data, use this: This block POSTs JSON data to a resource. You can capture the response JSON as ."

        "document": "Have you ever wanted to fetch post-JSON data from any API? If yes, then you are in luck. In this blog post, we will focus on how to fetch post-JSON data from any API. By post-JSON data, we mean data that is sent in the body of a POST request.\n\nThis is a common way to send data to an API, especially when you want to create or update a resource. Then we will show you how to use a simple and powerful tool called Apidog to do just that.\n\nIn the context of JavaScript, Fetch is a modern API for making HTTP requests. It provides a simpler and more intuitive interface than the older XMLHttpRequest object, and it is easier to use.\n\nWhat does a Fetch Request do?\n\nThe Fetch API is used to make requests to servers and receive responses in a format such as JSON, XML, or HTML.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the Fetch API to POST JSON data:\n\nIn this example, we are sending a POST request to with a JSON payload containing a single key-value pair. The header is set to to indicate that the payload is in JSON format. The method is used to convert the JSON object to a string before sending it in the request body.\n\nThe method returns a Promise that resolves to the Response object representing the response to the request. We can then use the method of the Response object to extract the JSON data from the response. Finally, we log the JSON data to the console.\n\nWhat Data Can be Passed via POST Request?\n\nIn HTTP requests, the POST method is typically used to send data to the server for creating a new resource or updating an existing one. The data can be sent in various formats via , and the choice of data type depends on the requirements of the server and the nature of the data being sent.\n\nHere are some common data types used in requests:\n• This is the most common data type used in web forms.\n• The data is encoded as a URL-encoded string, with key-value pairs separated by and pairs separated by .\n• Suitable for small amounts of data and simple key-value pairs.\n• JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate.\n• It is widely used in modern web applications for transmitting structured data.\n• JSON data is typically sent with the header set to .\n• XML is a markup language used for structuring data.\n• It was widely used in the past for data exchange, but its usage has declined in favor of JSON in recent years.\n• XML data is typically sent with the header set to or .\n• Still used in some legacy systems and specific domains.\n• Binary data, such as images, videos, or other files, can be sent in requests.\n• The binary data is typically encoded using Base64 or sent as multipart/form-data.\n• Raw data can be sent in the request body without any specific encoding or structuring.\n• The header should be set appropriately, such as for plain text data.\n\nThe choice of data type depends on the server's requirements, the complexity of the data being sent, and the preferences of the API or system you're working with. JSON has become the de facto standard for modern web APIs due to its simplicity, readability, and widespread support across programming languages and platforms.\n\nThere are many reasons why you might want to fetch post-JSON data from any API. For example, you might want to:\n• Test an API that you are developing or using\n• Learn how an API works and what data it expects and returns\n• Debug an issue or error with an API\n• Explore the features and capabilities of an API\n• Integrate an API with your own application or project\n\nWhatever your reason is, fetching post JSON data from any API can help you achieve your goal faster and easier. You don't need to write any code, install any software, or set up any environment. You just need a web browser and an internet connection.\n\nNow that we have a basic understanding of APIs, JSON, and Fetch, let’s dive into the details of how to fetch post JSON data using API.\n\nFetch Post request JSON Data method is used to send a JSON object as the payload of an HTTP POST request using the Fetch API. This method is similar to the Send JSON Object with POST Request method, but it uses the Fetch API to send the request instead of the XMLHttpRequest object. The Fetch API is a newer and more modern way of making HTTP requests in JavaScript, and it provides a simpler and more intuitive interface than the older XMLHttpRequest object. To fetch post JSON data using API, you need to follow these steps:\n\nIn this example, we are sending a POST request to with a JSON payload containing two key-value pairs. The header is set to to indicate that the payload is in JSON format. The method is used to convert the JSON object to a string before sending it in the request body.\n\nThe method returns a Promise that resolves to the Response object representing the response to the request. We can then use the method of the Response object to extract the JSON data from the response. Finally, we log the JSON data to the console.\n\nWhen using the Fetch API, it’s important to handle errors properly to ensure that your application behaves as expected. Here are some general guidelines for handling errors when using the Fetch API:\n• Use the method to handle network errors and other errors that may occur during the request.\n• Check the property of the response object to determine if the request was successful or not.\n• Use the property of the response object to determine the HTTP status code of the response.\n• Use the method of the response object to extract JSON data from the response.\n\nHere’s an example of how to handle errors when using the Fetch API:\n\nIn this example, we are sending a POST request to with a JSON payload containing a single key-value pair. The header is set to to indicate that the payload is in JSON format. The method is used to convert the JSON object to a string before sending it in the request body.\n\nThe method returns a Promise that resolves to the Response object representing the response to the request. We can then use the property of the Response object to check if the request was successful or not. If the request was not successful, we throw an error. If the request was successful, we use the method of the Response object to extract the JSON data from the response. Finally, we log the JSON data to the console.\n\nApidog is a web-based tool that helps you test and debug APIs. It allows you to send HTTP requests to any API endpoint and get the response in various formats, such as JSON, XML, HTML, etc. You can also inspect the headers, cookies, status codes, and other details of the response. Apidog also lets you manipulate the response data using JavaScript, filter the data using JSONPath, and validate the data using JSON Schema. You can also save your API requests and share them with others using a unique URL.\n\nApidog is a great tool for anyone who works with APIs, whether you are a developer, a tester, a designer, or a student. It helps you to:\n• Learn how to use different APIs and explore their features\n• Test and debug your own APIs and find errors and bugs\n• Experiment with different parameters and options and see how they affect the response\n• Document and demonstrate your API usage and results\n• Collaborate and communicate with other API users and developers\n\nApidog is easy to use, fast, and reliable. It works with any API that supports HTTP requests, such as RESTful, SOAP, GraphQL, etc. It also supports various authentication methods, such as Basic, Bearer, OAuth, etc. You can use Apidog on any device and browser, as long as you have an internet connection.\n\nApidog is an all-in-one collaborative API development platform that provides a comprehensive toolkit for designing, debugging, testing, publishing, and mocking APIs. It can also help to generate Fetch code.\n\nStep 1: Open Apidog and click on the \"New Request\" button to create a new request.\n\nStep 2: Enter the URL of the API endpoint that you want to fetch post JSON data from and switch to the Design interface.\n\nStep 4: Select the code you want to generate, in our case is Fetch, Copy and copy to your project\n\nPOST JSON Data from Any API Using Apidog\n\nTo Test fetch post-JSON data from any API using Apidog, you need to follow these simple steps:\n• Open Apidog and click on the \"New Request\" button to create a new request.\n• Select \"POST\" as the method of the request.\n\n3. Enter the URL of the API endpoint that you want to fetch post JSON data from. For example, if you want to fetch post JSON data from the JSON Placeholder API, which is a fake online REST API for testing and prototyping, you can enter https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts as the URL.\n\nThen click on the \"Body\" tab and select \"JSON\" as the type of the body. Enter the post JSON data that you want to send to the API in the text area. For example, if you want to create a new post with the JSON Placeholder API, you can enter the following post JSON data:\n\nClick on the “Send” button to send the request to the API and fetch the post JSON data.\n\nView the response from the API in the “Response” tab. You can see the status code, the headers, and the body of the response. You can also switch between different formats of the response, such as JSON, HTML, XML, or Raw. For example, if you fetch post JSON data from the JSON Placeholder API, you can see the following response in JSON format:\n\nCongratulations! You have successfully fetched post JSON data from any API using Apidog. You can now modify, save, or share your request as you wish.\n\nWhat are the Benefits of Fetching Post JSON Data Using Apidog?\n\nFetching post JSON data from any API using Apidog has many benefits, such as:\n• It is easy and convenient. You don’t need to write any code, install any software, or set up any environment. You just need a web browser and an internet connection.\n• It is fast and reliable. You can send and receive requests and responses in seconds. You can also see the status code, the headers, and the body of the responses in different formats.\n• It is flexible and versatile. You can fetch post JSON data from any API, whether it is public or private, simple or complex, RESTful or not. You can also add headers, query parameters, body parameters, and authentication to your requests.\n• It is fun and educational. You can learn how an API works and what data it expects and returns. You can also explore the features and capabilities of an API. You can also integrate an API with your own application or project.\n\nThe Fetch API is a web-standard interface for HTTP communication in JavaScript. In this blog post, we have learned how to fetch post-JSON data and we introduce Apidog.\n\nApidog supports various types of requests, such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, and more. You can also add headers, query parameters, body parameters, and authentication to your requests. Apidog can handle any kind of JSON data, whether it is an array, an object, or a nested structure."

Add another statement with a function that has an argument called :\n\nWithin this function, create a variable called that is set equal to :\n\nFor each author in , you will want to create a list item that displays their name. The method is suited for this pattern:\n\nWithin your function, create a variable called that will be set equal to with (the HTML element) as the argument. Also, create an for and a for :\n\nThe element will contain the of the . The element will contain the email of the . The property and string interpolation will allow you to do this:\n\nNext, connect these DOM elements with :\n\nNote that each list item is being appended to the . Once the is complete, the is appended to the unordered list element.\n\nWith both functions completed, you can now add the function. This function will log the potential error to the console:\n\nThis is the full code of the request you created:\n\nYou just successfully performed a GET request using the JSONPlaceholder API and the Fetch API. In the next step, you will perform POST requests.\n\nFetch defaults to GET requests, but you can use all other types of requests, change the headers, and send data. Let’s create a POST request.\n\nFirst, include a constant variable that holds the link to the JSONPlaceholder API:\n\nNext, you need to set your object and pass it as the second argument of the fetch function. This will be an object called with the key and value (or your name):\n\nSince this is a POST request, you will need to state that explicitly. Create an object called :\n\nThis object needs to include three keys: , , and :\n\nThe key will have the value . will be set equal to the format of the object that was just created. will have the value of .\n\nThe interface is a property of the Fetch API, which allows you to perform actions on HTTP request and response headers. This article called How To Define Routes and HTTP Request Methods in Express can provide you with more information.\n\nWith this code in place, the POST request can be made using the Fetch API. You will include and as arguments for your POST request:\n\nThe function will include code that handles the response received from the JSONPlaceholder API:\n\nThis is the full code of the request you created:\n\nWith this approach, can be used as the sole argument for , replacing and .\n\nNow you know two methods for creating and executing POST requests with the Fetch API.\n\nThe Fetch API is a modern and flexible interface for making network requests in JavaScript. It is promise-based, making it easier to handle asynchronous operations efficiently. However, it is not the only option for making network requests in JavaScript.\n\nAxios is a popular library for making HTTP requests in JavaScript. It is promise-based and has a simple and clean API. It also provides the ability to intercept requests and responses, transform data, and cancel requests.\n\nMany JavaScript frameworks, such as React, Vue.js, and Angular, have their own built-in methods for making network requests. These methods are often based on the Fetch API or Axios, but they may have additional features or be more tightly integrated with the framework’s ecosystem.\n\nIf you’re working on a simple project and prefer a lightweight, native solution, use Fetch API. However, for projects requiring automatic JSON parsing, interceptors, and better error handling, Axios is the better choice.\n\nYou can check out How to Use Vue.js and Axios to Display Data from an API for an Axios-based approach.\n\nReact applications often use Fetch API inside useEffect() to fetch data when a component mounts:\n\nFor better performance in React, consider using JavaScript Performance API.\n\nIn Vue.js, Fetch API is commonly used inside the lifecycle hook:\n\nAlternatively, many Vue.js projects prefer using Axios for its simplicity, as shown in How to Use Vue.js and Axios to Display Data from an API.\n\nIn Angular, Fetch API can be used within services using , but if using native Fetch API, you can implement it inside a component:\n\nFor large applications, Angular’s built-in is recommended for better scalability.\n\n1. What does Fetch API do in JavaScript?\n\nThe Fetch API provides a modern and flexible interface for making network requests in JavaScript. It allows you to fetch resources like JSON data, HTML, images, and more from a server. Unlike older methods like XMLHttpRequest, Fetch API is promise-based, making it easier to handle asynchronous operations efficiently.\n\n2. What is an example of Fetch API?\n\nA simple example of using Fetch API to request JSON data from an API:\n\nThis fetches a sample post from a placeholder API and logs it to the console. You can also check out How to Use Vue.js and Axios to Display Data from an API for another way to retrieve and display API data.\n\n3. How to fetch JSON data from an API in JavaScript?\n\nThis converts the response to JSON using and then processes the data. If you’re working with performance optimizations, you may also find JavaScript Performance API useful.\n\n4. How to fetch data from an API with JavaScript?\n\no fetch data asynchronously, use inside an function with :\n\nThis ensures cleaner code and better error handling. For advanced API integrations, consider learning about GraphQL API as an alternative to REST APIs.\n\n5. What is the difference between REST API and Fetch API?\n\nIn simpler terms, Fetch API is a tool used to interact with a REST API or any other data source available over the web.\n\nWhile the Fetch API is not yet supported by all the browsers, it is a great alternative to .\n\nThis tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on using Fetch API in JavaScript. However, if you’re working on a larger project, you may want to explore Axios for better error handling or GraphQL for more efficient data fetching.\n• Learn how to optimize API performance with JavaScript Performance API.\n• Explore GraphQL for an alternative to REST APIs.\n• Read How to Use Vue.js and Axios to Display Data from an API for a comparison with Axios.\n\nBy integrating these concepts, you can efficiently fetch and manage data in any JavaScript project.\n\nIf you would like to learn how to call Web APIs using React, check out this article on this very topic."
