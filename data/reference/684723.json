Error messages can change in the future, but error codes and type remain the same.\n\nWrap your code in / blocks to handle errors. If an error occurs, you can log it and return an error to the client.\n\nFor example, you can have a non-wrapped function:\n\nIf you add the / blocks to handle errors, you can return a more specific error message. You can also log the error:\n\nThe wrapped function returns an error message with more detail:\n\nYou can check the logs in the Unity Cloud Dashboard. To get more details about the error, select Products > Cloud Code > Logs.\n\nFor more information about batch requests, refer to Batch requests.\n\nEvery time a Cloud Code C# SDK returns an unsuccessful status code, the SDK throws an exception. You can use this exception to get the status code and error message.\n\nYou can catch the exception and handle it, or log and rethrow the error. This means you don't have to check for the status code in the object.\n\nCloud Code can't handle exceptions that result from memory leaks, such as infinite loops. If your module exceeds the memory limit, the worker eventually crashes. Cloud Code can't handle exceptions for patterns. Always return a or . For best practices in asynchronous programming, refer to the official Microsoft documentation.\n\nTo help you debug your modules, you can log errors and warnings with the interface.\n\nCloud Code automatically adds attributes like the , and to the logs, so you don't need to add them to your log messages.\n\nYou can log messages at different levels. These levels can help you query logs in the Unity Cloud Dashboard.\n\nTo view and filter your logs, navigate to the Unity Cloud Dashboard and select Products > Cloud Code > Logs.\n\nFor more information, refer to Emit logs."
