This property is if the underlying file has not been opened yet, i.e. before the event is emitted. Returns an object containing commonly used constants for file system operations. The following constants are exported by and . Not every constant will be available on every operating system; this is especially important for Windows, where many of the POSIX specific definitions are not available. For portable applications it is recommended to check for their presence before use. To use more than one constant, use the bitwise OR operator. The following constants are meant for use as the parameter passed to , , and . Flag indicating that the file is visible to the calling process. This is useful for determining if a file exists, but says nothing about permissions. Default if no mode is specified. Flag indicating that the file can be read by the calling process. Flag indicating that the file can be written by the calling process. Flag indicating that the file can be executed by the calling process. This has no effect on Windows (will behave like ). The definitions are also available on Windows. The following constants are meant for use with . If present, the copy operation will fail with an error if the destination path already exists. If present, the copy operation will attempt to create a copy-on-write reflink. If the underlying platform does not support copy-on-write, then a fallback copy mechanism is used. If present, the copy operation will attempt to create a copy-on-write reflink. If the underlying platform does not support copy-on-write, then the operation will fail with an error. The definitions are also available on Windows. The following constants are meant for use with . Flag indicating to create the file if it does not already exist. Flag indicating that opening a file should fail if the flag is set and the file already exists. Flag indicating that if path identifies a terminal device, opening the path shall not cause that terminal to become the controlling terminal for the process (if the process does not already have one). Flag indicating that if the file exists and is a regular file, and the file is opened successfully for write access, its length shall be truncated to zero. Flag indicating that data will be appended to the end of the file. Flag indicating that the open should fail if the path is not a directory. Flag indicating reading accesses to the file system will no longer result in an update to the information associated with the file. This flag is available on Linux operating systems only. Flag indicating that the open should fail if the path is a symbolic link. Flag indicating that the file is opened for synchronized I/O with write operations waiting for file integrity. Flag indicating that the file is opened for synchronized I/O with write operations waiting for data integrity. Flag indicating to open the symbolic link itself rather than the resource it is pointing to. When set, an attempt will be made to minimize caching effects of file I/O. Flag indicating to open the file in nonblocking mode when possible. When set, a memory file mapping is used to access the file. This flag is available on Windows operating systems only. On other operating systems, this flag is ignored. On Windows, only , , , , , , , and are available. The following constants are meant for use with the <fs.Stats> object's property for determining a file's type. Bit mask used to extract the file type code.

File mode indicating readable, writable, and executable by others. On Windows, only and are available.\n\nBecause they are executed asynchronously by the underlying thread pool, there is no guaranteed ordering when using either the callback or promise-based methods. For example, the following is prone to error because the operation might complete before the operation: It is important to correctly order the operations by awaiting the results of one before invoking the other: Or, when using the callback APIs, move the call into the callback of the operation: Most operations accept file paths that may be specified in the form of a string, a <Buffer>, or a <URL> object using the protocol. String paths are interpreted as UTF-8 character sequences identifying the absolute or relative filename. Relative paths will be resolved relative to the current working directory as determined by calling . Example using an absolute path on POSIX: Example using a relative path on POSIX (relative to ): For most module functions, the or argument may be passed as a <URL> object using the protocol. On Windows, <URL>s with a host name convert to UNC paths, while <URL>s with drive letters convert to local absolute paths. <URL>s with no host name and no drive letter will result in an error: <URL>s with drive letters must use as a separator just after the drive letter. Using another separator will result in an error. On all other platforms, <URL>s with a host name are unsupported and will result in an error: A <URL> having encoded slash characters will result in an error on all platforms: On Windows, <URL>s having encoded backslash will result in an error: Paths specified using a <Buffer> are useful primarily on certain POSIX operating systems that treat file paths as opaque byte sequences. On such systems, it is possible for a single file path to contain sub-sequences that use multiple character encodings. As with string paths, <Buffer> paths may be relative or absolute: Example using an absolute path on POSIX: On Windows, Node.js follows the concept of per-drive working directory. This behavior can be observed when using a drive path without a backslash. For example can potentially return a different result than . For more information, see this MSDN page. On POSIX systems, for every process, the kernel maintains a table of currently open files and resources. Each open file is assigned a simple numeric identifier called a file descriptor. At the system-level, all file system operations use these file descriptors to identify and track each specific file. Windows systems use a different but conceptually similar mechanism for tracking resources. To simplify things for users, Node.js abstracts away the differences between operating systems and assigns all open files a numeric file descriptor. The callback-based , and synchronous methods open a file and allocate a new file descriptor. Once allocated, the file descriptor may be used to read data from, write data to, or request information about the file. Operating systems limit the number of file descriptors that may be open at any given time so it is critical to close the descriptor when operations are completed. Failure to do so will result in a memory leak that will eventually cause an application to crash. The promise-based APIs use a <FileHandle> object in place of the numeric file descriptor. These objects are better managed by the system to ensure that resources are not leaked. However, it is still required that they are closed when operations are completed: All callback and promise-based file system APIs (with the exception of ) use libuv's threadpool. This can have surprising and negative performance implications for some applications. See the documentation for more information. The following flags are available wherever the option takes a string.\n• : Open file for appending. The file is created if it does not exist.\n• : Like but fails if the path exists.\n• : Open file for reading and appending. The file is created if it does not exist.\n• : Like but fails if the path exists.\n• : Open file for appending in synchronous mode. The file is created if it does not exist.\n• : Open file for reading and appending in synchronous mode. The file is created if it does not exist.\n• : Open file for reading.

An exception occurs if the file does not exist.\n• : Open file for reading and writing in synchronous mode. Instructs the operating system to bypass the local file system cache. This is primarily useful for opening files on NFS mounts as it allows skipping the potentially stale local cache. It has a very real impact on I/O performance so using this flag is not recommended unless it is needed. This doesn't turn or into a synchronous blocking call. If synchronous operation is desired, something like should be used.\n• : Open file for writing. The file is created (if it does not exist) or truncated (if it exists).\n• : Like but fails if the path exists.\n• : Open file for reading and writing. The file is created (if it does not exist) or truncated (if it exists).\n• : Like but fails if the path exists. can also be a number as documented by ; commonly used constants are available from . On Windows, flags are translated to their equivalent ones where applicable, e.g. to , or to , as accepted by . The exclusive flag ( flag in ) causes the operation to return an error if the path already exists. On POSIX, if the path is a symbolic link, using returns an error even if the link is to a path that does not exist. The exclusive flag might not work with network file systems. On Linux, positional writes don't work when the file is opened in append mode. The kernel ignores the position argument and always appends the data to the end of the file. Modifying a file rather than replacing it may require the option to be set to rather than the default . The behavior of some flags are platform-specific. As such, opening a directory on macOS and Linux with the flag, as in the example below, will return an error. In contrast, on Windows and FreeBSD, a file descriptor or a will be returned. On Windows, opening an existing hidden file using the flag (either through , , or ) will fail with . Existing hidden files can be opened for writing with the flag. A call to or can be used to reset the file contents."

        "document": "Editor’s note: This article was last updated by Muhammed Ali on 31 July 2024 to cover advanced parsing techniques and the issue of memory management when converting CSV files.\n\nComma-separated values, also known as CSVs, are one of the most common and basic formats for storing and exchanging tabular datasets for statistical analysis tools and spreadsheet applications. Due to their popularity, it is not uncommon for governing bodies and other important organizations to share official datasets in CSV format.\n\nDespite their simplicity, popularity, and widespread use, it is common for CSV files created using one application to display incorrectly in another. This is because there is no official universal CSV specification to which applications must adhere. As a result, several implementations exist with slight variations.\n\nMost modern operating systems and programming languages, including JavaScript and the Node.js runtime environment, have applications and packages for reading, writing, and parsing CSV files.\n\nIn this article, we will learn how to manage CSV files in Node. We shall also highlight the slight variations in the different CSV implementations. Some popular packages we will look at include csv-parser, Papa Parse, and Fast-CSV. We will follow the unofficial RFC 4180 technical standard, which attempts to document the format used by most CSV implementations.\n\nCSV files are ordinary text files comprised of data arranged in rectangular form. When you save a tabular dataset in CSV format, a new line character will separate successive rows while a comma will separate consecutive entries in a row. The image below shows a tabular dataset and its corresponding CSV format:\n\nIn the above CSV data, the first row is made up of field names, though that may not always be the case. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate your dataset before you start to read and parse it.\n\nAlthough the name “comma-separated values” seems to suggest that a comma should always separate subsequent entries in each record, some applications generate CSV files that use a semicolon as a delimiter instead of a comma.\n\nAs already mentioned, there is no official universal standard to which CSV implementations should adhere, even though the unofficial RFC 4180 technical standard exists. However, this standard came into existence many years after the CSV format gained popularity.\n\nHow to manage CSV files in Node.js\n\nIn the previous section, we had a brief introduction to CSV files. In this section, you will learn how to read, write, and parse CSV files in Node using both built-in and third-party packages.\n\nThe module is the de facto module for working with files in Node. The code below uses the function of the module to read from a file:\n\nThe corresponding example below writes to a CSV file using the function of the module:\n\nIf you are not familiar with reading and writing files in Node, check out my complete tutorial to reading and writing JSON files in Node.\n\nIf you use , , or its synchronous counterpart like in the above examples, Node will read the entire file into memory before processing it. With the and functions of the module, you can use streams instead to reduce memory footprint and data processing time.\n\nThe example below uses the function to read from a file:\n\nAdditionally, most of the third-party packages we will look at in the following subsections also use streams.\n\nThis is a relatively tiny third-party package you can install from the npm package registry. It is capable of parsing and converting CSV files to JSON.\n\nThe code below illustrates how to read data from a CSV file and convert it to JSON using csv-parser. We are creating a readable stream using the method of the module and piping it to the return value of :\n\nThere is an optional configuration object that you can pass to csv-parser. By default, csv-parser treats the first row of your dataset as .\n\nIf your dataset doesn’t have headers, or successive data points are not comma-delimited, you can pass the information using the optional configuration object. The object has additional configuration keys you can read about in the documentation.\n\nIn the example above, we read the CSV data from a file. You can also fetch the data from a server using an HTTP client like Axios or Needle. The code below illustrates how to do so:\n\nYou need to first install Needle before executing the code above. The request method returns a stream that you can pipe to . You can also use another package if Needle isn’t for you.\n\nThe above examples highlight just a tiny fraction of what csv-parser can do. As already mentioned, the implementation of one CSV document may be different from another. csv-parser has built-in functionalities for handling some of these differences.\n\nThough csv-parser was created to work with Node, you can use it in the browser with tools such as Browserify.\n\nPapa Parse is another package for parsing CSV files in Node. Unlike csv-parser, which works out of the box with Node, Papa Parse was created for the browser. Therefore, it has limited functionalities if you intend to use it in Node.\n\nWe illustrate how to use Papa Parse to parse CSV files in the example below. As before, we have to use the method of the module to create a read stream, which we then pipe to the return value of .\n\nThe function you use for parsing takes an optional second argument. In the example below, we pass the second argument with the property. If the value of the property is , Papa Parse will treat the first row in our CSV file as .\n\nThe object has other fields that you can look up in the documentation. Unfortunately, some properties are still limited to the browser and not yet available in Node:\n\nSimilarly, you can also fetch the CSV dataset as readable streams from a remote server using an HTTP client like Axios or Needle and pipe it to the return value of like before.\n\nIn the example below, I illustrate how to use Needle to fetch data from a server. It is worth noting that making a network request with one of the HTTP methods like returns a readable stream:\n\nFast-CSV is a flexible third-party package for parsing and formatting CSV datasets that combines and packages into a single package. You can use and for formatting and parsing CSV datasets, respectively.\n\nThe example below illustrates how to read a CSV file and parse it to JSON using Fast-CSV:\n\nAbove, we are passing the optional argument to the function. The object is primarily for handling the variations between CSV files. If you don’t pass it, csv-parser will use the default values. For this illustration, I am using the default values for most options.\n\nIn most CSV datasets, the first row contains the column headers. By default, Fast-CSV considers the first row to be a data record. You need to set the option to , like in the above example, if the first row in your dataset contains the column headers.\n\nSimilarly, as we mentioned in the opening section, some CSV files may not be comma-delimited. You can change the default delimiter using the option as we did in the example above.\n\nInstead of piping the readable stream as we did in the previous example, we can also pass it as an argument to the function as shown here:\n\nThe functions above are the primary functions you can use for parsing CSV files with Fast-CSV. You can also use the and functions, but we won’t cover them here. For more about them, I recommend the official documentation.\n\nWhen working with more complex CSV files, such as those with nested quotes or multiple delimiters, it is especially important to configure your CSV parser correctly.\n\nFor example, when dealing with fields that contain commas or other delimiters as part of the data, enclosing these fields in quotes is common. However, if your CSV file has inconsistent quoting or nested quotes, parsing can become tricky. Here’s how you can handle these scenarios:\n\nIn the example above, the and options are set to handle nested quotes. Adjust these settings based on the specific structure of your CSV file.\n\nCSV files may not always include headers. If you encounter a headerless CSV, you can dynamically assign headers based on the data or handle it differently depending on your needs.\n\nIn the above example, we manually specify headers for the CSV file, which will be applied during parsing.\n\nA common issue that occurs when dealing with large CSV files is that converting CSV to a string can cause memory issues, leading to memory leaks or crashes. This typically happens because reading the entire file into memory at once can exhaust available memory, especially with very large datasets.\n\nTo avoid this, you should stream the CSV file line by line, processing each chunk individually. This method not only helps manage memory more efficiently but also speeds up the data processing time.\n\nHere’s how to handle large files with streaming:\n• Using streams to process data in chunks rather than loading the entire file into memory\n• Controlling the buffer size when streaming data to avoid overloading memory\n• Ensuring efficient memory management by monitoring and triggering garbage collection where necessary\n\nThe comma-separated values format is one of the most popular formats for data exchange. CSV datasets consist of simple text files readable to both humans and machines. But despite its popularity, there is no universal standard.\n\nThe unofficial RFC 4180 technical standard attempts to standardize the format, but some subtle differences exist among the different CSV implementations. These differences exist because the CSV format started before the RFC 4180 technical standard came into existence. Therefore, it is common for CSV datasets generated by one application to display incorrectly in another application.\n\nYou can use the built-in functionalities or third-party packages for reading, writing, and parsing simple CSV datasets in Node. Most of the CSV packages we looked at are flexible enough to handle the subtle differences resulting from the different CSV implementations."

The CSV file uses a comma delimiter to separate values in table cells, and a new line delineates where rows begin and end. Most spreadsheet programs and databases can export and import CSV files. Because CSV is a plain-text file, any programming language can parse and write to a CSV file. Node.js has many modules that can work with CSV files, such as , , and .\n\nIn this tutorial, you will use the module to read a CSV file using Node.js streams, which lets you read large datasets without consuming a lot of memory. You will modify the program to move data parsed from the CSV file into a SQLite database. You will also retrieve data from the database, parse it with , and use Node.js streams to write it to a CSV file in chunks.\n\nTo follow this tutorial, you will need:\n• Node.js installed on your local or server environment. Follow How to Install Node.js and Create a Local Development Environment to install Node.js.\n• SQLite installed on your local or server environment, which you can install by following step 1 in How To Install and Use SQLite on Ubuntu 20.04. Knowledge on how to use SQLite is helpful and can be learned in steps 2-7 of the installation guide.\n• Familiarity with writing a Node.js program. See How To Write and Run Your First Program in Node.js.\n• Familiarity with Node.js streams. See How To Work with Files Using Streams in Node.js.\n\nIn this section, you will create the project directory and download packages for your application. You will also download a CSV dataset from Stats NZ, which contains international migration data in New Zealand.\n\nTo get started, make a directory called and navigate into the directory:\n\nNext, initialize the directory as an npm project using the command:\n\nThe option notifies to say “yes” to all the prompts. This command creates a with default values that you can change anytime.\n\nWith the directory initialized as an npm project, you can now install the necessary dependencies: and .\n\nEnter the following command to install :\n\nThe module is a collection of modules that allows you to parse and write data to a CSV file. The command installs all four modules that are part of the package: , , , and . You will use the module to parse a CSV file and the module to write data to a CSV file.\n\nThe module allows your app to interact with the SQLite database.\n\nAfter installing the packages in your project, download the New Zealand migration CSV file with the command:\n\nThe CSV file you downloaded has a long name. To make it easier to work with, rename the file name to a shorter name using the command:\n\nThe new CSV filename, , is shorter and easier to work with.\n\nUsing , or your favorite text editor, open the file:\n\nOnce open, you will see contents similar to this:\n\nThe first line contains the column names, and all subsequent lines have the data corresponding to each column. A comma separates each piece of data. This character is known as a delimiter because it delineates the fields. You are not limited to using commas. Other popular delimiters include colons( ), semicolons( ), and tabs( ). You need to know which delimiter is used in the file since most modules require it to parse the files.\n\nAfter reviewing the file and identifying the delimiter, exit your file using .\n\nYou have now installed the necessary dependencies for your project. In the next section, you will read a CSV file.\n\nIn this section, you will use to read a CSV file and log its content in the console. You will use the module’s method to read the data from the CSV file and create a readable stream. You will then pipe the stream to another stream initialized with the module to parse the chunks of data. Once the chunks of data have been parsed, you can log them in the console.\n\nCreate and open a file in your preferred editor:\n\nIn your file, import the and modules by adding the following lines:\n\nIn the first line, you define the variable and assign it the object that the Node.js method returns when it imports the module.\n\nIn the second line, you extract the method from the object returned by the method into the variable using the destructuring syntax.\n\nAdd the following lines to read the CSV file:\n\nThe method from the module accepts an argument of the filename you want to read, which is here. Then, it creates a readable stream, which takes a large file and breaks it into smaller chunks. A readable stream allows you to only read data from it and not write to it.\n\nAfter creating the readable stream, Node’s method forwards chunks of data from the readable stream to another stream. The second stream is created when the module’s method is invoked inside the method. The module implements a transform stream (a readable and writable stream), taking a data chunk and transforming it to another form. For example, when it receives a chunk like , the method will transform it into an array.\n\nThe method takes an object that accepts properties. The object then configures and provides more information about the data the method will parse. The object takes the following properties:\n• defines the character that separates each field in the row. The value tells the parser that commas demarcate the fields.\n• defines the line where the parser should start parsing the rows. With the value , the parser will skip line 1 and start at line 2. Because you will insert the data in the database later, this property helps you avoid inserting the column names in the first row of the database.\n\nNext, you attach a streaming event using the Node.js method. A streaming event allows the method to consume a chunk of data if a certain event is emitted. The event is triggered when data transformed from the method is ready to be consumed. To access the data, you pass a callback to the method, which takes a parameter named . The parameter is a data chunk transformed into an array. Within the callback, you log the data in the console using the method.\n\nBefore running the file, you will add more stream events. These stream events handle errors and write a success message to the console when all the data in the CSV file has been consumed.\n\nStill in your file, add the highlighted code:\n\nThe event is emitted when all the data in the CSV file has been read. When that happens, the callback is invoked and logs a message that says it has finished.\n\nIf an error occurs anywhere while reading and parsing the CSV data, the event is emitted, which invokes the callback and logs the error message in the console.\n\nYour complete file should now look like the following:\n\nSave and exit out of your file using .\n\nNext, run the file using the command:\n\nThe output will look similar to this (edited for brevity):\n\nAll the rows in the CSV file have been transformed into arrays using the transform stream. Because logging happens each time a chunk is received from the stream, the data appears as though it is being downloaded rather than being displayed all at once.\n\nIn this step, you read data in a CSV file and transformed it into arrays. Next, you will insert data from a CSV file into the database.\n\nInserting data from a CSV file into the database using Node.js gives you access to a vast library of modules that you can use to process, clean, or enhance the data before inserting it into the database.\n\nIn this section, you will establish a connection with the SQLite database using the module. You will then create a table in the database, copy the file, and modify it to insert all the data read from the CSV file into the database.\n\nCreate and open a file in your editor:\n\nIn your file, add the following lines to import the and modules:\n\nIn the third line, you define the path of the SQLite database and store it in the variable . The database file doesn’t exist yet, but it will be needed for to establish a connection with the database.\n\nIn the same file, add the following lines to connect Node.js to a SQLite database:\n\nHere, you define a function named to establish a connection to the database. Within the function, you invoke the module’s method in an statement, which checks if the database file exists in the project directory. If the condition evaluates to , you instantiate the SQLite’s class of the module with the database filepath. Once the connection is established, the function returns the connection object and exits.\n\nHowever, if the statement evaluates to (if the database file doesn’t exist), execution will skip to the block. In the block, you instantiate the class with two arguments: the database file path and a callback.\n\nThe first argument is the path of the SQLite database file, which is . The second argument is a callback that will be invoked automatically when the connection with the database has been established successfully or if an error occurred. The callback takes an object as a parameter, which is if the connection is successful. Within the callback, the statement checks if the object is set. If it evaluates to , the callback logs an error message and returns. If it evaluates to , you log a success message confirming that the connection has been established.\n\nCurrently, the and blocks establish the connection object. You pass a callback when invoking the class in the block to create a table in the database, but only if the database file does not exist. If the database file already exists, the function will execute the block, connect with the database, and return the connection object.\n\nTo create a table if the database file doesn’t exist, add the highlighted code:\n\nNow the invokes the function, which accepts the connection object stored in the variable as an argument.\n\nOutside the function, you define the function, which accepts the connection object as a parameter. You invoke the method on the connection object that takes a SQL statement as an argument. The SQL statement creates a table named with 7 columns. The column names match the headings in the file.\n\nFinally, you invoke the function and export the connection object returned by the function so that it can be reused in other files.\n\nWith the database connection established, you will now copy and modify the file to insert the rows that the module parsed into the database.\n\nCopy and rename the file to with the following command:\n\nOpen the file in your editor:\n\nIn the third line, you import the connection object from the file and store it in the variable .\n\nInside the event callback attached to the module stream, you invoke the method on the connection object. The method ensures that a SQL statement finishes executing before another one starts executing, which can help prevent database race conditions where the system runs competing operations simultaneously.\n\nThe method takes a callback. Within the callback, you invoke the method on the connection object. The method accepts three arguments:\n• The first argument is a SQL statement that will be passed and executed in the SQLite database. The method only accepts SQL statements that don’t return results. The statement inserts a row in the table , and the are placeholders that are later substituted with the values in the method second argument.\n• The second argument is an array . In the previous section, the method receives a chunk of data from the readable stream and transforms it into an array. Since the data is received as an array, to get each field value, you must use array indexes to access them like , etc.\n• The third argument is a callback that runs when the data has been inserted or if an error occurred. The callback checks if an error occurred and logs the error message. If there are no errors, the function logs a success message in the console using the method, letting you know that a row has been inserted along with the id.\n\nFinally, remove the and events from your file. Due to the asynchronous nature of the methods, the and events execute before the data is inserted into the database, so they are no longer required.\n\nDepending on your system, it may take some time, but should return the output below:\n\nThe message, especially the ids, proves that the row from the CSV file has been saved into the database.\n\nYou can now read a CSV file and insert its content into the database. Next, you will write a CSV file.\n\nIn this section, you will retrieve data from the database and write it into a CSV file using streams.\n\nCreate and open in your editor:\n\nIn your file, add the following lines to import the and modules and the database connection object from :\n\nThe module transforms data from an object or array into a CSV text format.\n\nNext, add the following lines to define a variable that contains the name of the CSV file you want to write data to and a writable stream that you will write data to:\n\nThe method takes an argument of the filename you want to write your stream of data to, which is the file name stored in the variable.\n\nIn the fourth line, you define a variable, which stores an array containing the names of the headers for the CSV data. These headers will be written in the first line of the CSV file when you start writing the data to the file.\n\nStill in your file, add the following lines to retrieve data from the database and write each row in the CSV file:\n\nFirst, you invoke the method with an object as an argument, which creates a transform stream. The transform stream converts the data from an object into CSV text. The object passed into the method has two properties:\n• accepts a boolean value and generates a header if the boolean value is set to .\n• takes an array containing the names of the columns that will be written in the first line of the CSV file if the option is set to .\n\nNext, you invoke the method from the connection object with two arguments. The first argument is the SQL statement that retrieves the rows one by one in the database. The second argument is a callback invoked each time a row is retrieved from the database. The callback takes two parameters: an object and a object containing data retrieved from a single row in the database. Within the callback, you check if the object is set in the statement. If the condition evaluates to , an error message is logged in the console using the method. If there is no error, you invoke the method on , which writes the data into the transform stream.\n\nWhen the method finishes iterating, the method on the stream starts sending data in chunks and writing it in the . The writable stream will save each chunk of data in the file. Once all the data has been written to the file, will log a success message.\n\nThe complete file will now look like the following:\n\nSave and close your file, then run the file in the terminal:\n\nYou will receive the following output:\n\nTo confirm that the data has been written, inspect the contents in the file using the command:\n\nwill return all the rows written in the file (edited for brevity):\n\nYou can now retrieve data from the database and write each row in a CSV file using streams.\n\nIn this article, you read a CSV file and inserted its data into a database using the and modules. You then retrieved data from the database and wrote it to another CSV file.\n\nYou can now read and write CSV files. As a next step, you can now work with large CSV datasets using the same implementation with memory-efficient streams, or you might look into a package like that make working with streams much easier.\n\nTo explore more about , visit their documentation CSV Project - Node.js CSV package.

        "document": "Editor’s note: This article was last updated by Muhammed Ali on 31 July 2024 to cover advanced parsing techniques and the issue of memory management when converting CSV files.\n\nComma-separated values, also known as CSVs, are one of the most common and basic formats for storing and exchanging tabular datasets for statistical analysis tools and spreadsheet applications. Due to their popularity, it is not uncommon for governing bodies and other important organizations to share official datasets in CSV format.\n\nDespite their simplicity, popularity, and widespread use, it is common for CSV files created using one application to display incorrectly in another. This is because there is no official universal CSV specification to which applications must adhere. As a result, several implementations exist with slight variations.\n\nMost modern operating systems and programming languages, including JavaScript and the Node.js runtime environment, have applications and packages for reading, writing, and parsing CSV files.\n\nIn this article, we will learn how to manage CSV files in Node. We shall also highlight the slight variations in the different CSV implementations. Some popular packages we will look at include csv-parser, Papa Parse, and Fast-CSV. We will follow the unofficial RFC 4180 technical standard, which attempts to document the format used by most CSV implementations.\n\nCSV files are ordinary text files comprised of data arranged in rectangular form. When you save a tabular dataset in CSV format, a new line character will separate successive rows while a comma will separate consecutive entries in a row. The image below shows a tabular dataset and its corresponding CSV format:\n\nIn the above CSV data, the first row is made up of field names, though that may not always be the case. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate your dataset before you start to read and parse it.\n\nAlthough the name “comma-separated values” seems to suggest that a comma should always separate subsequent entries in each record, some applications generate CSV files that use a semicolon as a delimiter instead of a comma.\n\nAs already mentioned, there is no official universal standard to which CSV implementations should adhere, even though the unofficial RFC 4180 technical standard exists. However, this standard came into existence many years after the CSV format gained popularity.\n\nHow to manage CSV files in Node.js\n\nIn the previous section, we had a brief introduction to CSV files. In this section, you will learn how to read, write, and parse CSV files in Node using both built-in and third-party packages.\n\nThe module is the de facto module for working with files in Node. The code below uses the function of the module to read from a file:\n\nThe corresponding example below writes to a CSV file using the function of the module:\n\nIf you are not familiar with reading and writing files in Node, check out my complete tutorial to reading and writing JSON files in Node.\n\nIf you use , , or its synchronous counterpart like in the above examples, Node will read the entire file into memory before processing it. With the and functions of the module, you can use streams instead to reduce memory footprint and data processing time.\n\nThe example below uses the function to read from a file:\n\nAdditionally, most of the third-party packages we will look at in the following subsections also use streams.\n\nThis is a relatively tiny third-party package you can install from the npm package registry. It is capable of parsing and converting CSV files to JSON.\n\nThe code below illustrates how to read data from a CSV file and convert it to JSON using csv-parser. We are creating a readable stream using the method of the module and piping it to the return value of :\n\nThere is an optional configuration object that you can pass to csv-parser. By default, csv-parser treats the first row of your dataset as .\n\nIf your dataset doesn’t have headers, or successive data points are not comma-delimited, you can pass the information using the optional configuration object. The object has additional configuration keys you can read about in the documentation.\n\nIn the example above, we read the CSV data from a file. You can also fetch the data from a server using an HTTP client like Axios or Needle. The code below illustrates how to do so:\n\nYou need to first install Needle before executing the code above. The request method returns a stream that you can pipe to . You can also use another package if Needle isn’t for you.\n\nThe above examples highlight just a tiny fraction of what csv-parser can do. As already mentioned, the implementation of one CSV document may be different from another. csv-parser has built-in functionalities for handling some of these differences.\n\nThough csv-parser was created to work with Node, you can use it in the browser with tools such as Browserify.\n\nPapa Parse is another package for parsing CSV files in Node. Unlike csv-parser, which works out of the box with Node, Papa Parse was created for the browser. Therefore, it has limited functionalities if you intend to use it in Node.\n\nWe illustrate how to use Papa Parse to parse CSV files in the example below. As before, we have to use the method of the module to create a read stream, which we then pipe to the return value of .\n\nThe function you use for parsing takes an optional second argument. In the example below, we pass the second argument with the property. If the value of the property is , Papa Parse will treat the first row in our CSV file as .\n\nThe object has other fields that you can look up in the documentation. Unfortunately, some properties are still limited to the browser and not yet available in Node:\n\nSimilarly, you can also fetch the CSV dataset as readable streams from a remote server using an HTTP client like Axios or Needle and pipe it to the return value of like before.\n\nIn the example below, I illustrate how to use Needle to fetch data from a server. It is worth noting that making a network request with one of the HTTP methods like returns a readable stream:\n\nFast-CSV is a flexible third-party package for parsing and formatting CSV datasets that combines and packages into a single package. You can use and for formatting and parsing CSV datasets, respectively.\n\nThe example below illustrates how to read a CSV file and parse it to JSON using Fast-CSV:\n\nAbove, we are passing the optional argument to the function. The object is primarily for handling the variations between CSV files. If you don’t pass it, csv-parser will use the default values. For this illustration, I am using the default values for most options.\n\nIn most CSV datasets, the first row contains the column headers. By default, Fast-CSV considers the first row to be a data record. You need to set the option to , like in the above example, if the first row in your dataset contains the column headers.\n\nSimilarly, as we mentioned in the opening section, some CSV files may not be comma-delimited. You can change the default delimiter using the option as we did in the example above.\n\nInstead of piping the readable stream as we did in the previous example, we can also pass it as an argument to the function as shown here:\n\nThe functions above are the primary functions you can use for parsing CSV files with Fast-CSV. You can also use the and functions, but we won’t cover them here. For more about them, I recommend the official documentation.\n\nWhen working with more complex CSV files, such as those with nested quotes or multiple delimiters, it is especially important to configure your CSV parser correctly.\n\nFor example, when dealing with fields that contain commas or other delimiters as part of the data, enclosing these fields in quotes is common. However, if your CSV file has inconsistent quoting or nested quotes, parsing can become tricky. Here’s how you can handle these scenarios:\n\nIn the example above, the and options are set to handle nested quotes. Adjust these settings based on the specific structure of your CSV file.\n\nCSV files may not always include headers. If you encounter a headerless CSV, you can dynamically assign headers based on the data or handle it differently depending on your needs.\n\nIn the above example, we manually specify headers for the CSV file, which will be applied during parsing.\n\nA common issue that occurs when dealing with large CSV files is that converting CSV to a string can cause memory issues, leading to memory leaks or crashes. This typically happens because reading the entire file into memory at once can exhaust available memory, especially with very large datasets.\n\nTo avoid this, you should stream the CSV file line by line, processing each chunk individually. This method not only helps manage memory more efficiently but also speeds up the data processing time.\n\nHere’s how to handle large files with streaming:\n• Using streams to process data in chunks rather than loading the entire file into memory\n• Controlling the buffer size when streaming data to avoid overloading memory\n• Ensuring efficient memory management by monitoring and triggering garbage collection where necessary\n\nThe comma-separated values format is one of the most popular formats for data exchange. CSV datasets consist of simple text files readable to both humans and machines. But despite its popularity, there is no universal standard.\n\nThe unofficial RFC 4180 technical standard attempts to standardize the format, but some subtle differences exist among the different CSV implementations. These differences exist because the CSV format started before the RFC 4180 technical standard came into existence. Therefore, it is common for CSV datasets generated by one application to display incorrectly in another application.\n\nYou can use the built-in functionalities or third-party packages for reading, writing, and parsing simple CSV datasets in Node. Most of the CSV packages we looked at are flexible enough to handle the subtle differences resulting from the different CSV implementations."

        "document": "The term CSV is an abbreviation that stands for comma-separated values.\n\nA CSV file is a plain text file that contains data formatted according to the CSV standard. It has distinct lines which represent records and each field in the record is separated from another by a comma.\n\nIt's very convenient to store tabular data in CSV:\n\nHere, the first row represents the titles of the columns/fields of our CSV records and then there are 3 records that represent certain people. As you can see, the values are delimited by commas and each record starts on a new row.\n\nThere are several approaches to solving this issue, for example, we could wrap up such values in double quotes. Some of the CVS implementations don't support this feature by design, though.\n\nOne of the most commonly used CSV standards is described in the RFC4180.\n\nAccording to it, the CSV format is described by these 7 rules:\n• Each record is located on a separate line, delimited by a line break (CRLF).\n• The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line break.\n• There may be an optional header line appearing as the first line of the file with the same format as normal record lines. This header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file and should contain the same number of fields as the records in the rest of the file (the presence or absence of the header line should be indicated via the optional \"header\" parameter of this MIME type).\n• Within the header and each record, there may be one or more fields, separated by commas. Each line should contain the same number of fields throughout the file. Spaces are considered part of a field and should not be ignored. The last field in the record must not be followed by a comma.\n• Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes at all). If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then double quotes may not appear inside the fields.\n• Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas should be enclosed in double-quotes.\n• If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with another double quote.\n\nIf you're interested in reading more with multiple examples, you can study the original RFC4180 document, linked above.\n\nTo read a CSV file in Node.js, we could use nothing else than just the module, as in essence the CSV file is a plain text file.\n\nIf you're interested in reading more about Reading Files with Node.js or Writing Files with Node.js, we've got both covered!\n\nHowever, there are a couple of helpful modules that could handle generating or parsing the CSV content for us. We'll start by installing the module :\n\nThen, let's put the CSV data from the beginning of the article to a file called and follow up with a very simple example:\n\nHere, we create a using the module, pipe it into the object that will then fire the event each time a new row from the CSV file is processed. The event is triggered when all the rows from the CSV file are processed and we log a short message to the console to indicate that.\n\nFor demonstration purposes, we just each processed row and after running the code, you'll see this output in your console:\n\nRemembering the fact that CSV files are just plain text files, we could always limit ourselves to using only the native module, but to make our life easier, we'll use another common module, .\n\nFirst goes the installation:\n\nThe module requires an initial configuration where we provide it with the name of the resulting CSV file and the configuration.\n\nNote: In our JavaScript object, all properties are in lowercase, but in the CSV file the first letters of them should be capitalized.\n\nAfter the config is done, all we need to do is call the function, pass in the array that represents the data structure that should be written to the CSV file.\n\nOnce this process is done, we'll print an informational message to the console stating that the program has completed.\n\nThe Node.js ecosystem and provides a lot of options to read and write CSV files. We'll show another example of a popular CSV module and take a look at how we can write our data array using the module as an alternative.\n\nFirst, we have to install the module:\n\nThe API is a bit different, but the result is identical. In just a couple of lines of code, we managed to write the array of JavaScript objects to a CSV file that could be later used by a variety of other applications.\n\nReading and writing CSV files with Node.js is a common development task as a CSV format is commonly used to store structured tabular data. Many modules provide this functionality, so you should choose the one that suits best to your needs and has ongoing support."
