        "document": "Over the summer of 2021 I started working for an Internet of Things (IoT) startup, Blues Wireless that aims to make IoT development easy - even when reliable Internet connections are not available. Blues does this via Notecards - prepaid cellular devices that can be embedded into any IoT device \"on the edge\" to transmit sensor data as JSON to a secure cloud: Notehub.\n\nI am not a hardware or firmware engineer however, web development is my area of expertise (frontend in particular), so to dip my toes into IoT development, I started off building a simpler project: an asset tracker using only a Blues Notecard, Blues Notecarrier AL with a built-in GPS antenna, and a small lithium-ion polymer (LiPo) battery to power it all.\n\nWith the help of the Blues developer experience docs, I had temperature, voltage, and GPS location data being delivered to the Notehub cloud from my tracker in under 30 minutes. That's cool and all, but the way that data from sensors in the world really becomes useful is when it's displayed to users in some sort of UI, right? It could be maps, tables, or in my case, charts.\n\nSo I wanted to take my data from the Notehub cloud and pump it into a custom-made dashboard to track and display the Notecard's location, voltage, and sensor readings in the real world. React is my current JavaScript framework of choice, and I decided to build a Next.js TypeScript-powered dashboard, and I learned a ton of interesting things in the process, which I intend to share with you over a series of blog posts in the next few months.\n\nToday, I plan to show you how to build charts and a custom styled tooltip in a Next.js application with the Recharts Library, using real-world data from a third-party API source.\n\nHere's what the final dashboard looks like - the temperature and voltage charts are the focus for this particular post.\n\nNOTE This article will not go through the initial setup of a brand new Next.js app - that's outside the scope of this blog. If you're starting from scratch, I would recommend following the Next.js starter app with TypeScript documentation.\n\nTo get started adding charts to our Next.js application, we have to install the Recharts library. Recharts is a chart library built with React and the popular data visualization library D3, and it makes it easy to use React-based chart components that feel familiar to make all sorts of different types of charts, while still allowing a high degree of flexibility for customization, as needed.\n\nInstall the Recharts library in the Next.js app with the following commands in a terminal.\n\nThis is the only new library needed to get Recharts up and running, even when using TypeScript, so it's time to move on and make some various chart components.\n\nThe first type of chart component we'll create for the dashboard will be used to display the temperature data supplied by the Notecard. This will be an area chart that looks like the image here.\n\nSince this component will have the sole goal of displaying temperature data, create a new file in the repo named , and paste the following code into it. The actual code in GitHub is available by clicking the file title below.\n\nThere's a lot of imports from Recharts happening in this component, so let's go through them one by one to understand what their purposes are.\n\nEach of the imports from the library at the very top of the file represent a different component used to make this chart display correctly.\n• is the container for all the chart data and is how Recharts knows what type of chart it's rendering.\n• is where the array of data to be displayed by the chart is passed. The and properties in the component allow us to define the chart's line color and fill color as hex codes.\n• XAxis and YAxis are how the chart knows what the X and Y axes of the chart should use as their data displays.\n• The property inside of the axis component is the property name of the array data being passed to the chart. For example, each item in the array of data being passed to the temperature chart's has a property of , so that is the for the component.\n• must always be a child component of the or component and it displays a custom axis label.\n• I like it because the chart label, label angle, value, positioning, and more can be changed very easily here.\n• draws the nice squares which align with the cartesian coordinate axes.\n• This is not a required component, but I think it improves chart readability. The property is customizable, so feel free to play with the numbers to find a square pattern that suits you.\n• although our tooltip will end up being a custom component, in order to display it the custom one, we must pass it into the generic component as the property . We'll get into this more when we create the tooltip component, so put a pin in this for now.\n• wraps the whole chart component and makes it responsive to the size of the parent container. Although the chart component itself can be given a and , they're static. When passing the component width and height props, one should be a percentage string.\n• For my component, the is , for this reason.\n\nThe only other import to this file is the component and we'll get to this component in depth soon.\n\nAfter all the imports, the are defined for the TypeScript array of data being passed to this chart. The are pretty simple: each object in the array will contain:\n• A (this is a simplified date format of MM/DD/YYYY) to display in the component,\n• A - the longer form date of MMM D, YYYY h:mm A to display in the tooltip,\n\nFinally, all of these chart components are composed in the JSX to make a responsive area chart with dates on the X axis, temperature on the Y axis, a lavender stroke and fill color, and a custom tooltip.\n\nThe second chart component we're going to build is for the Notecard's voltage levels over time. The Notecard is designed to be ultra low power so even small batteries can power it for long stretches of time (multiple years, even), but it's still good to keep an eye on the voltage so if it does start to drop, the LiPo battery can be recharged or swapped out.\n\nThis component will be a standard line chart instead of an area chart, so create a new component file named in your project.\n\nA lot of the code for the component should feel familiar when you read over it - it's quite similar to the component's code. As before, you can click the file title to go the GitHub code.\n\nAs with the , the imports all the same Recharts components except it uses and to indicate that this chart will be displayed as a line chart instead of an area chart and tell the component the will be an unbroken type with a soft green color.\n\nBeyond these key differences everything else is much the same: same chart wrapper, similarly shaped array (the property on each object is replaced by here), same X and Y axis data (although this Y axis has a property that sets the upper and lower bounds of the chart), and even the same component.\n\nSo now that we've defined our charts, it's time to dive into that component.\n\nThis is where things stopped being so straightforward. If we examine the Recharts tooltip API documentation closely, you'll see mention of the method as a way to render a custom tooltip, lucky for us, this method links to example code so we can see what props a custom tooltip component can take, including CSS styling.\n\nHere is what our custom tooltip is going to end up looking like.\n\nIn the app, make a new component file named , and go ahead and make a new style file named .\n\nThe component here takes in two props:\n• - a boolean denoting if a tooltip should be displayed (this happens when a user mouses over the chart on desktop or clicks on a particular point on mobile),\n• - the data the tooltip will be displaying from the chart. For us, we want the chart's temp (or voltage) and the more specific timestamp in our tooltip.\n\nThe custom tooltip's JSX checks if is true for a particular data point and if the exists as a single object in the array. If both conditions are met, the tooltip displays the longer format date and either the temperature or voltage depending on which chart the tooltip's being invoked with.\n\nOur data's being displayed in the tooltip, now to give it a little styling to look decent.\n\nThe class wraps all the tooltip data, giving it a white background, black text with a little padding, a slight box shadow, and some nicely rounded corners. Nested inside of this class are which defines some margins around the text, and , which gives extra emphasis to the font.\n\nThen import the SCSS file into the component file, define the module's name as and plug in the corresponding CSS in the correct components in the JSX. Now when this component is imported into the two chart components, it should look good and display the more specific tooltip data we want.\n\nWith that done, we're ready to start using these components in the dashboard page.\n\nRender the charts in the application\n\nOk, so in the main file where all our dashboard components are imported, let's add our charts and prepare to pass data to them.\n\nThere's not much to these imports, they're standard default imports to get these components into the file. After the two chart components are imported, they're rendered inside of the JSX down at the bottom of the file. The function at the bottom of the file that I've written a comment for is where the Notehub data gets pulled into the app, and the comment right under our line is where we'll transform that raw data into the and arrays that our charts need.\n\nLet's get to it.\n\nPull in data for the charts\n\nIn my previous asset tracking dashboard article I went into great detail about how to create your own asset tracker to generate real data for the app using Blues Wireless hardware and a data fetching function.\n\nIf you'd like to follow along there to build your own tracker and route data to Notehub, please be my guest.\n\nFor this post, I'll jump ahead to the part where we're already pulling data into the app via a Next.js API call. The JSON data from the Notehub cloud looks like this:\n\nEach JSON object in this array is a separate motion event that displays the Notecard's current location and sensor readings. The part of the object that we care about in this particular post is the and values. This is the data our charts need.\n\nTake that data and reshape it to work with our chart and tooltip components\n\nWith the correct shape of our data being fed into our app (either via and Notehub) or the JSON test data I shared above, it's time to reshape this data.\n\nI've condensed down the logic to make this file easier to read, but you can see the full file on GitHub.\n\nHere's what's happening in this file, we declare two new React state variables: and - these arrays are what get passed to the chart components. Each of these variables is an object with three properties: , , and either or .\n\nThen, inside of a function that runs as soon as the variable is available via the call, we sort the data, and then iterate over each object in the original array and create a new and from the data that gets pushed into the and variables declared at the very top of the .\n\nFinally, those arrays are set into the component's state with our variables. At this point, you should have a couple of nice looking charts displaying a few points of data about your Notecard's voltage and temperature.\n\nOnce I started working for an IoT startup, getting more familiar with the possibilities of what sensors could report from the real world became more of a focus for me - but still from a web development perspective. To that end, I built a web dashboard pulling data from our hardware devices out in the field: location, temperature, battery voltage, etc.\n\nFor the data like temperature and voltage, charts seemed most appropriate to display the changing values over time, and so I chose the Recharts library to help with these data visualizations. The library's easy to work with and produces some nifty looking charts without too much effort on my part, and when I wanted to style my own tooltip and display some custom data, that was straightforward too.\n\nThis dashboard actually came in handy when my parents' car was stolen from their driveway the night after Thanksgiving. If you want to hear the whole story and build your own tracker, check out this blog post and video I made for Blues Wireless - it details the whole process from hardware to software to deploying to Netlify.\n\nCheck back in a few weeks — I’ll be writing more about JavaScript, React, IoT, or something else related to web development.\n\nThanks for reading. I hope you enjoyed learning how to create a couple of charts and custom tooltips using the Recharts library - slick data visualizations have so many potential applications for transforming lots of data points into meaningful data people can draw conclusions from."

        "document": "Data visualization is a crucial aspect of modern web applications. It allows users to understand and interpret complex data quickly through visual representation. In React applications, several libraries are available to create stunning and interactive charts.\n\nIn this article, we will explore using one such library, Recharts, and its benefits in a React application.\n\nRecharts is a composable charting library built on React components. It provides a simple and declarative approach to creating charts within React applications.\n\nRecharts is a React-based library that leverages D3.js under the hood for high-quality charting capabilities. It offers a collection of customizable React components for building various charts.\n\nRecharts is known for its ease of use, responsiveness, and rich features. It allows developers to create functional and aesthetically pleasing charts with minimal code.\n\nWhat is the use of Recharts in React?\n\nRecharts simplifies the data visualization process in React by providing a set of ready-to-use chart components. These components are designed to work seamlessly within the React ecosystem, making integrating charts into your application easier.\n\nRegarding data visualization, D3.js is a powerful tool with a steep learning curve. Recharts, however, abstracts much of the complexity of D3, providing a more accessible entry point for developers.\n\nWhat is the difference between D3 and Recharts?\n\nD3.js is a low-level library that offers a wide range of visualization options. Recharts is built on top of D3, providing a higher-level API more aligned with the React way of building user interfaces.\n\nRecharts vs. Chartjs: Choosing the Right Tool\n\nBoth Recharts and Chartjs are popular libraries for creating charts in web applications. However, they differ in their approach and integration with React.\n\nWhat is the difference between Chartjs and Recharts?\n\nChartjs is a standalone charting library that can be used with React but is not specifically designed for it. Recharts, being a React-focused library, offers a more integrated experience for React developers.\n\nWhy Do We Use Recharts?\n\nRecharts is favored in React applications for its simplicity, performance, and compatibility with React's component-based architecture. It allows developers to quickly visualize data with components that are easy to integrate and customize.\n\nSetting Up Recharts in Your Project\n\nTo begin using Recharts, you must first install the library in your React project. This can be done using npm or yarn package managers.\n\nHow to install Recharts in a React application\n\nAfter running the installation command, you can import Recharts components into your React application.\n\nLet's create a simple bar chart component as an example of how to use Recharts.\n\nIn this example, we import the necessary components from Recharts and define a data array. The BarChart component is then rendered with Bar components representing each data series.\n\nThe Role of the Recharts Responsive Container\n\nCreating responsive charts is essential for modern web applications accessed across various devices with different screen sizes. The Recharts library provides a ResponsiveContainer component to address this need.\n\nDefinition and use of the recharts responsive container\n\nThe recharts responsive container automatically adjusts the chart size to fit the parent container, ensuring the chart is visually appealing on any device.\n\nIn this code snippet, the ResponsiveContainer wraps the BarChart component, making it responsive to the width of its parent div.\n\nBar charts are a common chart used to compare different groups of data points. Recharts make creating and customizing bar charts within your React application easy.\n\nYou can use Recharts's BarChart and Bar components to create a bar chart. Here's a simple example:\n\nCustomization can be done by changing the fill property of the Bar component and adding a Tooltip component for interactivity.\n\nLine charts are ideal for visualizing data trends over time. Recharts provides a simple way to create line charts with the LineChart and Line components.\n\nHere's how you can create a basic line chart to display time series data:\n\nYou can add multiple Line components within the LineChart component to visualize multiple data series.\n\nArea charts represent cumulative data, showing the sum of the quantified values over time. Recharts provides the AreaChart and Area components to create these types of charts.\n\nIntroduction to area charts and their use cases\n\nArea charts are similar to line charts but with the area below the line filled in. They are useful for visualizing the volume of data over a period.\n\nCustomization and animation can enhance the visual appeal of area charts. Recharts allows you to easily style your charts and add animations for a dynamic user experience.\n\nIn this example, we use a linearGradient to create a gradient fill for the area chart. The CartesianGrid component adds a grid to the chart for better readability.\n\nComponents of Recharts: Pie Charts and More\n\nRecharts offers a variety of chart types, including pie charts, which are great for showing proportions.\n\nPie charts are straightforward to create with Recharts. Here's a basic example:\n\nOther Chart Types Available in Recharts\n\nRecharts also supports other chart types such as radar, scatter, and treemap charts, providing a comprehensive set of tools for data visualization.\n\nThe CartesianGrid and axes are essential components that add structure and scale to charts, making data easier to interpret.\n\nImportance of Cartesian Grid and Axes in Charts\n\nThe grid helps to align data points with their corresponding values on the axes, while the axes provide a reference for the data's scale and context.\n\nRecharts allows you to customize the appearance and behavior of the grid and axes, including their color, style, and format.\n\nTooltips and legends enhance the interactivity of charts by providing additional information and context to the user.\n\nTooltips appear when the user hovers over a data point, displaying more detailed information about that point.\n\nLegends help users understand what each color or shape in the chart represents, especially when multiple data series are present.\n\nEnsuring your charts are responsive is crucial for a good user experience across all devices. Recharts' ResponsiveContainer is a powerful tool for achieving this.\n\nEnsuring Your Charts Are Responsive with the Container\n\nThe ResponsiveContainer handles the chart's responsiveness, adjusting its size based on the parent container's dimensions.\n\nYou can specify the width and height as percentages to make the chart fluid within the ResponsiveContainer.\n\nRecharts components can be exported and shared across different parts of your application or even across different projects.\n\nHow to Export Default App with Recharts Components\n\nYou can use the export default app statement to export your chart components for other parts of your React application.\n\nBy exporting your chart components, you can easily import them into other projects, promoting code reuse and consistency.\n\nWhen things go wrong, it's critical to understand how to troubleshoot and resolve typical problems using Recharts.\n\nCommon issues include incorrect data formats, missing properties, or syntax errors. Checking the console for errors can provide clues to what might be wrong.\n\nThe Recharts documentation is a valuable resource for understanding how to use the library and for finding solutions to common problems.\n\nBest Practices for Using Recharts\n\nTo get the most out of Recharts, it's important to follow best practices for performance and maintainability.\n\nOptimizing Performance of Recharts in Your App\n\nThis includes minimizing the number of re-renders and using pure components to prevent unnecessary updates.\n\nOrganizing your chart components and separating concerns can keep your codebase clean and easier to maintain.\n\nRecharts offers advanced features for developers who need more control over their charts.\n\nThis includes custom shapes and patterns and even integrating with other libraries for more complex visualizations.\n\nRecharts provides a flexible API for customizing charts, allowing you to adjust nearly every aspect of the chart's appearance and behavior.\n\nConclusion: The Power of Recharts in React Applications\n\nThis article has provided an overview of the Recharts library, its components, and how to use them to create responsive and interactive charts in your React applications. Following the examples and best practices outlined, you can enhance your data visualization capabilities and create stunning charts that bring your data to life. Whether building a simple bar chart or a complex area chart with animations, Recharts offers the tools to visualize your data effectively.

        "document": "This article was last updated on November 5, 2024 to include performance optimization tips and responsive design techniques for improved chart rendering in Recharts.\n\nCharts make it easy to represent complex data in a simple and visually appealing way. With charts, you can easily identify trends and patterns and make comparisons across different variables and data types. You can use charts to interpret current data and predict the future.\n\nThere are several types of charts you can use to visually represent data. Some of them include Line Charts, Bar Charts, Area Charts, and Scatter charts. The choice of a chart largely depends on the type of data. Different types of charts are suited for different purposes.\n\nThere are several libraries for creating charts in the React ecosystem. These React chart libraries include react-flow-charts, react-financial-charts, react-charts and Recharts. In this article, we will explore how to create charts in a Refine project using Recharts.\n\nWhat we will cover:\n• Recharts Performance Optimization with Large Data Sets\n• Limit Data Points to Display Only What's Necessary\n• How to Make Recharts Responsive for Different Screen Sizes\n\nRecharts is a popular, MIT-licensed library for creating charts in React and React-based frameworks like refine. Internally, it uses SVG and some lightweight D3 packages as its dependencies.\n\nRecharts has several built-in components that you can compose to create some of the commonest charts such as Area charts, Bar charts, Pie charts, and Line charts.\n\nAs an example, the code below illustrates how you can use Rechart's built-in components to create a Bar chart. The component names are self-explanatory.\n\nIn this section, we will create a Refine demo project.\n\nSelect the options below when prompted by the command line tool.\n\nAfter setting up the project and installing dependencies, use the command below to launch the development server.\n\nLater in this article, we will create charts using Recharts and render them in a dashboard. Let's add a dashboard to the project we have just created.\n\nCreate the file. Copy and paste the code below into it. Be aware that the directory doesn't exist yet. You need to first create it.\n\nThe component above renders a simple \"Hello world!\" text at the moment. We will add more code to it later. Now we need to export the component above. Create the file. Copy and paste the code below into it.\n\nYou can now import the component we created above and render it in the component. Add the changes below to the file.\n\nIn the code above, we added another data provider. The data provider will fetch data from the fast foods API. It's a dummy API created by the Refine team. You can use it to create simple projects when testing out refine. We will use the API to create charts later.\n\nYou will now see a dashboard entry in the sidebar. The dashboard will look like the image below. We will create charts and render them in the dashboard in the next sub-sections.\n\nBefore we start creating charts, let's create a simple interface for the data from our API. Create the file. Copy and paste the interface below into it.\n\nYou can install Recharts either from the npm package registry or get its UMD build via a CDN. Depending on your package manager, use one of the commands below to install Recharts.\n\nLine charts consist of a series of data points connected using line segments. They are mostly used to represent time series data. You can use Rechart's built-in component to create a Line chart like so:\n\nCharts in general need to have features such as axes, Cartesian grid, legend, and tooltips. Therefore, we need to use the component with Rechart's built-in general and Cartesian components as in the example above.\n\nThe component has the prop for passing the data you want to represent on the Line chart. The data should be an array of objects like in the example below.\n\nLet's create a simple Line chart in our Refine project. We will render it in the dashboard we created above. Start by creating the file. Copy and paste the code below into it. The directory doesn't exist yet. Start by creating it.\n\nIn the example above, the component is wrapped in a responsive container. We will do the same while creating other charts later. We need to export the component we created above so that we can easily import and render it anywhere in our project. Create the file. Copy and paste the code below into it.\n\nLet's now import the above component and render it in the component. Copy and paste the code below into the file.\n\nIn the code above, we are using the hook to make custom query requests to the backend. The hook uses TanStack Query's hook under the hook. We have been querying the daily revenue, daily orders, and new customers of a restaurant business for the last seven days. We will represent the data in different types of charts. The dashboard should now have a Line chart that looks like the image below.\n\nThere are several Line chart variants you can create using Rechart's built-in components. For more complex charts, check out the Recharts documentation.\n\nRecharts has the built-in component for creating area charts. You can compose the built-in component to create complex area charts in your React project.\n\nYou can use the component's prop to pass the data you want to represent on an area chart. Like in the previous example, your data should be an array of objects.\n\nTo represent the above data in an area chart, you can use the component as in the example below. As before, the component names are self-explanatory.\n\nLet's now add an area chart to the Refine project we created above. Create the file. Copy and paste the code below into it.\n\nIn the example above, we are representing the daily revenue of a restaurant business in an area chart. We are fetching the data in our dashboard component and passing it as a prop to the above component. Once again we are wrapping the area chart in a responsive container.\n\nYou need to export the above component by adding the changes below to the file.\n\nYour dashboard should now have a simple area chart that looks like the image below.\n\nThere are several types of Area charts. What we have created above is a simple Area chart. Recharts has built-in functionality for implementing most of them. For more, check out the documentation.\n\nBar charts are among the most common charts for visualizing data. You can use it to visually represent categorical data. Recharts has the built-in component for creating bar charts.\n\nLike the other types of charts, the data you want to represent on a bar chart should be an array of objects. You need to pass it to the component as the value of the prop.\n\nLet's add a bar chart to the dashboard in the Refine project we created above. Create the file. Copy and paste the code below into it.\n\nWe need to export the component above. Add the changes below to the file.\n\nWe can now import and render the above component. Add the changes below to the file.\n\nAfter rendering the above component, your dashboard should now have a bar chart that looks like the image below.\n\nScatter charts are useful to graphically represent the relationship between two variables. Like the other charts mentioned above, Recharts has the built-in component for creating scatter charts.\n\nLet's create a simple scatter chart in this article. Create the file. Copy and paste the code below into it.\n\nIn the example above, we wrapped the chart in a responsive container and passed the data to the component instead of the . Similar to the other charts we have already looked at, the data should be an array of objects.\n\nIn the example above, we had to transform the data because we wanted to determine the relationship between two variables(daily orders and new customers).\n\nLet's export the above component. Add the changes below to the file.\n\nYou can now import and render the above component in the dashboard. Add the changes below to the file.\n\nAfter rendering the above component, the dashboard should now have a scatter chart that looks like the image below.\n\nA pie chart is one of the most common and easy-to-understand charts. It is a circular graph that is split into multiple sectors. Each sector in a pie chart represents a particular category of data and its size is proportional to the quantity of the category it represents.\n\nIn this section, we will create a simple Pie chart using Recharts. Let's start by creating the file. Copy and paste the code below into it.\n\nLet's export the above component so that we can import it anywhere in our application. Add the changes below to the file.\n\nLet's import and render the above component in our dashboard. Add the changes below to the file.\n\nYour dashboard should now have a Pie chart that looks like the image below.\n\nA Treemap is a data visualization tool similar to a Pie chart. However, instead of using a circular graph and sectors to represent data, a Treemap instead uses rectangles and nested rectangles.\n\nWith a Treemap, a rectangle represents a category, and nested rectangles represent sub-categories within a category. Recharts has the built-in component for creating Treemaps. You can pass the data as the value of the data attribute.\n\nLet's add a simple Treemap to our dashboard. Create the file. Copy and paste the code below into it.\n\nIn the example above, we have hard-coded the data because the API doesn't have a dataset we can use to create a Treemap. In a typical real-world project, you will retrieve the data from an API. You can export the above component from the file like so:\n\nYour dashboard should now have a Treemap that looks like the image below.\n\nI have been researching the best practices to keep Recharts performing well, especially with larger datasets, and wanted to pass on a few tips that might help keep things smooth. Recharts is good for data visualization, but small adjustments can make all the difference when working with sizable chunks of data. Here's what I came up with:\n\nThe performance can really slow down when dealing with a time series or high-frequency data, especially if it tries to render each and every data point. The solution is straightforward: limit the number of data points or summarize data. For example, you might display every 10th data point or use averages for simpler overviews.\n\nIf your chart data or settings aren’t changing on every render, use React.memo or PureComponent to prevent unnecessary updates. This is especially useful with big data sets or complex charts.\n\nUsing memo ensures that LineChartComponent only re-renders if the data prop changes.\n\nRecharts renders using SVG, so reducing the number of elements in the SVG will help performance. For example, remove grid lines, extra labels, or multiple tooltips if they’re not necessary.\n\nThis keeps the chart minimal and improves performance.\n\nIf you have multiple charts on a page, consider lazy-loading them as the user scrolls. This improves initial load times by rendering charts only when visible. You can use react-intersection-observer for easy implementation.\n\nSetting loads the chart only when it first comes into view, conserving resources if the user doesn’t scroll down.\n\nI’ve put together some tips on making Recharts charts responsive to different screen sizes. Recharts itself has some built-in features for responsiveness, but a few tweaks can make sure the charts look great on both desktop and mobile.\n\nRecharts provides a component that allows the chart to automatically resize to fit its container. Wrapping charts in this component is a quick way to make them responsive:\n\nHere, width=\"100%\" makes the chart resize to fit the container width, while height={300} keeps the height fixed.\n\nFor charts that need to maintain consistent proportions (like in grids), you can set an aspect ratio in ResponsiveContainer. This keeps the chart’s proportions uniform across different screens:\n\nSetting aspect={4 / 3} means the height will adjust according to the width, preserving a 4:3 ratio and preventing stretching on wide or narrow screens.\n\nSome elements like tooltips, labels, or legends may need to be hidden or resized on smaller screens. You can use CSS media queries to style these elements conditionally or use JavaScript to control visibility based on screen width:\n\nIn this example, we use useMediaQuery to adjust the chart’s height and hide the legend on smaller screens.\n\nUsing Recharts on smaller screens may require padding and margin adjustments to prevent elements from overlapping. Setting smaller margins on mobile can help avoid crowding:\n\nThese recommendations should make it easier to design charts that adapt well to any screen size, ensuring a better user experience across devices.\n\nSometimes you may have to integrate data visualization in your React project. Charts make it easy to present data in an easy-to-understand and visually appealing way.\n\nThere are several frameworks for creating charts in React. Recharts is one of the most popular and feature-rich packages for creating charts in a React project or React-based frameworks such as refine.\n\nRecharts support several types of charts out of the box. In this article, we have only explored a subset of charts you can create using Recharts. Check the documentation for details."

The that provides is great at responsively resizing in one direction, but a fixed height of 350px on a large screen winds up stretching the chart out.\n\nFor those who haven't used Tailwind CSS, here's the documentation on using responsive breakpoints and more information about sizing utility classes.\n\nThe example below highlights how you can pass tailwind-style media breakpoints to the property, which will let you responsively resize your chart based on the screen size.\n\nHere's an example of how you could use this chart component in various sized containers:\n\nThe resulting \"dashboard\" should look something like this on desktop:\n\nAnd something like this on mobile:"
