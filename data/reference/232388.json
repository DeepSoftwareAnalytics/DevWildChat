        "document": "Description: Autocomplete enables users to quickly find and select from a pre-populated list of values as they type, leveraging searching and filtering.\n\nAny field that can receive input can be converted into an Autocomplete, namely, elements, elements, and elements with the attribute. When typing in the autocomplete field, the plugin starts searching for entries that match and displays a list of values to choose from. By entering more characters, the user can filter down the list to better matches. This can be used to choose previously selected values, such as entering tags for articles or entering email addresses from an address book. Autocomplete can also be used to populate associated information, such as entering a city name and getting the zip code. You can pull data in from a local or remote source: Local is good for small data sets, e.g., an address book with 50 entries; remote is necessary for big data sets, such as a database with hundreds or millions of entries to select from. To find out more about customizing the data source, see the documentation for the option. When the menu is open, the following key commands are available:\n• : Move focus to the previous item. If on first item, move focus to the input. If on the input, move focus to last item.\n• : Move focus to the next item. If on last item, move focus to the input. If on the input, move focus to the first item.\n• : Select the currently focused item and close the menu.\n• : Select the currently focused item, close the menu, and move focus to the next focusable element.\n• / : Scroll through a page of items (based on height of menu). It's generally a bad idea to display so many items that users need to page. When the menu is closed, the following key commands are available:\n• / : Open the menu, if the has been met. The autocomplete widget uses the jQuery UI CSS framework to style its look and feel. If autocomplete specific styling is needed, the following CSS class names can be used for overrides or as keys for the option:\n• : The menu used to display matches to the user.\n• : The input element that the autocomplete widget was instantiated with. While requesting data to display to the user, the class is also added to this element.\n\nWhich element the menu should be appended to. When the value is , the parents of the input field will be checked for a class of . If an element with the class is found, the menu will be appended to that element. Regardless of the value, if no element is found, the menu will be appended to the body. Note: The option should not be changed while the suggestions menu is open. Code examples: Initialize the autocomplete with the option specified: Get or set the option, after initialization: If set to the first item will automatically be focused when the menu is shown. Code examples: Initialize the autocomplete with the option specified: Get or set the option, after initialization: Specify additional classes to add to the widget's elements. Any of classes specified in the Theming section can be used as keys to override their value. To learn more about this option, check out the learn article about the option. Code examples: Initialize the autocomplete with the option specified, changing the theming for the class: Get or set a property of the option, after initialization, here reading and changing the theming for the class: The delay in milliseconds between when a keystroke occurs and when a search is performed. A zero-delay makes sense for local data (more responsive), but can produce a lot of load for remote data, while being less responsive. Code examples: Initialize the autocomplete with the option specified: Get or set the option, after initialization: Disables the autocomplete if set to . Code examples: Initialize the autocomplete with the option specified: Get or set the option, after initialization: The minimum number of characters a user must type before a search is performed. Zero is useful for local data with just a few items, but a higher value should be used when a single character search could match a few thousand items. Code examples: Initialize the autocomplete with the option specified: Get or set the option, after initialization: Default: { my: \"left top\", at: \"left bottom\", collision: \"none\" } option defaults to the input element, but you can specify another element to position against. You can refer to the Identifies the position of the suggestions menu in relation to the associated input element. Theoption defaults to the input element, but you can specify another element to position against. You can refer to the jQuery UI Position utility for more details about the various options. Code examples: Initialize the autocomplete with the option specified: Get or set the option, after initialization: Default: none; must be specified Defines the data to use, must be specified. Independent of the variant you use, the label is always treated as text. If you want the label to be treated as html you can use Scott González' html extension. The demos all focus on different variations of the option - look for one that matches your use case, and check out the code. Multiple types supported:\n• Array: An array can be used for local data. There are two supported formats:\n• An array of objects with and properties: The label property is displayed in the suggestion menu. The value will be inserted into the input element when a user selects an item. If just one property is specified, it will be used for both, e.g., if you provide only properties, the value will also be used as the label.\n• String: When a string is used, the Autocomplete plugin expects that string to point to a URL resource that will return JSON data. It can be on the same host or on a different one (must support CORS). The Autocomplete plugin does not filter the results, instead a query string is added with a field, which the server-side script should use for filtering the results. For example, if the option is set to and the user types , a GET request would be made to . The data itself can be in the same format as the local data described above.\n• Function: The third variation, a callback, provides the most flexibility and can be used to connect any data source to Autocomplete, including JSONP. The callback gets two arguments:\n• A object, with a single property, which refers to the value currently in the text input. For example, if the user enters in a city field, the Autocomplete term will equal .\n• A callback, which expects a single argument: the data to suggest to the user. This data should be filtered based on the provided term, and can be in any of the formats described above for simple local data. It's important when providing a custom source callback to handle errors during the request. You must always call the callback even if you encounter an error. This ensures that the widget always has the correct state. When filtering data locally, you can make use of the built-in function. It'll take a single string argument and escape all regex characters, making the result safe to pass to . Code examples: Initialize the autocomplete with the option specified: Get or set the option, after initialization:\n\nCloses the Autocomplete menu. Useful in combination with the method, to close the open menu.\n• None This method does not accept any arguments. Removes the autocomplete functionality completely. This will return the element back to its pre-init state.\n• None This method does not accept any arguments.\n• None This method does not accept any arguments.\n• None This method does not accept any arguments. Retrieves the autocomplete's instance object. If the element does not have an associated instance, is returned. Unlike other widget methods, is safe to call on any element after the autocomplete plugin has loaded.\n• None This method does not accept any arguments. Gets the value currently associated with the specified . Note: For options that have objects as their value, you can get the value of a specific key by using dot notation. For example, would get the value of the property on the option.\n• The name of the option to get. Gets an object containing key/value pairs representing the current autocomplete options hash.\n• None This signature does not accept any arguments. Sets the value of the autocomplete option associated with the specified . Note: For options that have objects as their value, you can set the value of just one property by using dot notation for . For example, would update only the property of the option.\n• The name of the option to set.\n• A value to set for the option. Sets one or more options for the autocomplete. to display all items. Triggers a event and invokes the data source if the event is not canceled. Can be used by a selectbox-like button to open the suggestions when clicked. When invoked with no parameters, the current input's value is used. Can be called with an empty string andto display all items. Returns a object containing the menu element. Although the menu items are constantly created and destroyed, the menu element itself is created during initialization and is constantly reused.\n• None This method does not accept any arguments.\n\nThe autocomplete widget is built with the widget factory and can be extended. When extending widgets, you have the ability to override or add to the behavior of existing methods. The following methods are provided as extension points with the same API stability as the plugin methods listed above. For more information on widget extensions, see Extending Widgets with the Widget Factory. Method that controls the creation of each option in the widget's menu. The method must create a new element, append it to the menu, and return it. See the Menu documentation for more details about the markup.\n• The element that the newly created element must be appended to.\n• \n• The string to display for the item.\n• The value to insert into the input when the item is selected. Code examples: Add the item's value as a data attribute on the . and an array of items that match the user typed term. Creation of the individual elements should be delegated to , which in turn delegates to the Method that controls building the widget's menu. The method is passed an emptyand an array of items that match the user typed term. Creation of the individualelements should be delegated to, which in turn delegates to the extension point.\n• An empty element to use as the widget's menu.\n• An Array of items that match the user typed term. Each item is an Object with and properties. Code examples: Add a CSS class name to the odd menu items. Method responsible for sizing the menu before it is displayed. The menu element is available at .\n• None This method does not accept any arguments. Code examples: Always display the menu as 500 pixels wide.\n\nTriggered when the field is blurred, if the value has changed.\n• \n• The item selected from the menu, if any. Otherwise the property is . Code examples: Initialize the autocomplete with the change callback specified: Bind an event listener to the autocompletechange event: Triggered when the menu is hidden. Not every event will be accompanied by a event. Note: The object is empty but included for consistency with other events. Code examples: Initialize the autocomplete with the close callback specified: Bind an event listener to the autocompleteclose event: Triggered when the autocomplete is created. Note: The object is empty but included for consistency with other events. Code examples: Initialize the autocomplete with the create callback specified: Bind an event listener to the autocompletecreate event: Triggered when focus is moved to an item (not selecting). The default action is to replace the text field's value with the value of the focused item, though only if the event was triggered by a keyboard interaction. Canceling this event prevents the value from being updated, but does not prevent the menu item from being focused. Code examples: Initialize the autocomplete with the focus callback specified: Bind an event listener to the autocompletefocus event: Triggered when the suggestion menu is opened or updated. Note: The object is empty but included for consistency with other events. Code examples: Initialize the autocomplete with the open callback specified: Bind an event listener to the autocompleteopen event: Triggered after a search completes, before the menu is shown. Useful for local manipulation of suggestion data, where a custom option callback is not required. This event is always triggered when a search completes, even if the menu will not be shown because there are no results or the Autocomplete is disabled.\n• \n• Contains the response data and can be modified to change the results that will be shown. This data is already normalized, so if you modify the data, make sure to include both and properties for each item. Code examples: Initialize the autocomplete with the response callback specified: Bind an event listener to the autocompleteresponse event: Triggered before a search is performed, after and are met. If canceled, then no request will be started and no items suggested. Note: The object is empty but included for consistency with other events. Code examples: Initialize the autocomplete with the search callback specified: Bind an event listener to the autocompletesearch event: Triggered when an item is selected from the menu. The default action is to replace the text field's value with the value of the selected item. Canceling this event prevents the value from being updated, but does not prevent the menu from closing.\n• \n• An Object with and properties for the selected option. Code examples: Initialize the autocomplete with the select callback specified: Bind an event listener to the autocompleteselect event:"
