        "document": "Building a trading bot in Python involves several steps, including setting up your development environment, connecting to a trading platform, implementing a trading strategy, backtesting your strategy, and deploying your bot.\n\nBuilding a trading bot in Python can be an exciting and challenging endeavor for individuals interested in automated trading and financial markets. By automating your trading strategies, you can take advantage of real-time market data, execute trades faster, and potentially improve your trading performance.\n\nIn this step-by-step guide, we will walk you through the process of building a trading bot in Python. We’ll cover the essential steps, starting from setting up your development environment to executing trades and monitoring performance. Additionally, we’ll provide examples of different trading strategies that you can implement using Python.\n\nBefore you start building the trading bot, you need to set up your Python development environment. Install Python on your computer and choose a code editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or Jupyter Notebook.\n\nTo interact with real-time market data and execute trades, you’ll need access to a trading platform’s API. Popular platforms like Alpaca, Coinbase, Binance, or Interactive Brokers provide APIs for developers. Choose a platform based on your trading needs and sign up for an API key.\n\nPython offers several libraries for building trading bots. Install the required libraries using pip or Anaconda. Some commonly used libraries include:\n• requests: For making HTTP requests to the trading platform’s API.\n• ccxt: For interacting with various cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nYou can install these libraries by running the following command in your terminal:\n\nIn this step, you’ll establish a connection to the trading platform’s API using your API key. Refer to the documentation of the chosen platform to understand how to connect to their API. Typically, you’ll need to provide your API key and secret in your code to authenticate your requests.\n\nTo make informed trading decisions, you need access to market data such as price, volume, and order book. Use the API to fetch real-time or historical market data. For example, you can use the library to send HTTP requests and receive JSON responses from the API endpoints.\n\nA trading bot operates based on a specific trading strategy. Define your trading strategy and implement it in Python. It could involve technical indicators, price patterns, or other factors to determine when to buy or sell. Use libraries like pandas and numpy to manipulate and analyze the data.\n\na few examples of trading strategies that you can implement in Python:\n\nMoving Average Crossover Strategy: This strategy involves using two moving averages of different time periods (e.g., 50-day and 200-day moving averages) to generate buy and sell signals. When the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, it generates a buy signal, and when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average, it generates a sell signal.\n\nBollinger Bands Strategy: This strategy uses Bollinger Bands, which are volatility bands placed above and below a moving average. When the price touches the lower band, it may indicate an oversold condition, and when it touches the upper band, it may indicate an overbought condition.\n\nMean Reversion Strategy: This strategy assumes that the price of an asset will eventually revert to its mean or average. It involves identifying periods of overbought or oversold conditions and taking positions to capitalize on the expected mean reversion.\n\nBreakout Strategy: This strategy aims to capitalize on the price breaking out of a defined range or level of support/resistance. It involves identifying consolidation periods and taking positions when the price breaks above or below the range.\n\nOnce your trading strategy identifies a trading opportunity, you need to execute the trade. Use the trading platform’s API to place buy or sell orders programmatically. Make sure to handle errors and implement appropriate risk management measures to protect your capital.\n\nYou can now run your trading bot and observe its performance. Monitor the bot’s trades, performance metrics, and adjust your strategy if needed. You may consider running the bot in a loop to continuously monitor and react to market conditions.\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of your trading strategy, perform backtesting using historical data. You can simulate trades based on past market conditions to analyze the strategy’s performance. Make necessary adjustments to your strategy and iterate the process until you achieve desirable results.\n\nTrading bots require constant monitoring and improvement. Keep up with market trends, explore new trading strategies, and optimize your code for better performance. Learn from your bot’s performance and make adjustments as necessary."

        "document": "Jesse is one of those tools that is simple enough to do very easy the simple things and good enough for the most complicated stuff. Saleh is very helpful, always listening to the community's needs and suggestions. And the community is one of the best things about jesse that helps in problems and share ideas.\n\nI have been using Jesse for a few years now and I love it. Its workflow is simple but perfect, allowing me the freedom and control to do as I wish in my strategy. I look forward to future releases and updates.I recommend and share Jesse with everyone I know that has an interest in this space.\n\nJesse is a fantastic tool for anyone who wants to dive deep into both programming and trading. As a programmer, I immediately feel at home with its use of Python and VueJS. The backend is elegant and well-thought-out, making working with Jesse a real pleasure. Jesse has shown me how essential clear rules are for success in trading. The ability to easily validate strategies and their performance over long periods has significantly improved my approach and provided me with valuable insights. Thank you, Saleh, for this extraordinary tool!\n\nI've been using Jesse to implement my trading strategies, and it’s honestly been a game-changer. The platform is straightforward to use and incredibly flexible, making it easy to modify and fine-tune strategies. The documentation and structure make it accessible, even for those who don't have extensive coding experience. For the price you're getting great value. It’s affordable compared to other platforms, and you get access to a powerful set of tools like backtesting, live and papertrading. The community around Jesse is very helpful, and always willing to share insights. Saleh is very active. He’s responsive to questions and open to suggestions for improvements, continuously improving the platform. If you’re serious about algorithmic trading, Jesse is definitely worth checking out!\n\nI have been trading with jesse for more than 3 years now and I am very satisfied with the tools and support they are offering! This framework has been very useful to me and suits my needs nicely. For me, it is the easiest, most modulable and best deal of all trading softwares. The projects is continuously getting new improvements and I am glad to participate in its expansion. Apart from occasionnal bugs and awaited features, the support is fast and kind, which is very appreciated! Pleasure to follow jesse along the journey and benefit from the regular updates that make this tool greater and greater, one step at a time!\n\nI recently started using Jesse.Trade for my algorithmic trading, and I couldn't be more impressed. The framework is incredibly user-friendly, making it easy to implement and test my strategies. The comprehensive documentation and active community support helped me get up to speed quickly. I've seen significant improvements in my trading performance since I started using Jesse.Trade. The ability to backtest strategies against historical data has been a game-changer for me. Overall, I highly recommend Jesse.Trade to anyone looking to enhance their trading capabilities!\n\nSo! I have been testing out Jesse for a couple of weeks now, and for what its worth, here is my verdict. Long story short, I ended up buying the liftetime license for a couple of reasons. Firstly, Jesse has native support for trading futures, this is a major win! Secondly, though I have quite some experience within python programming, I find Jesse a lot simpler and less convoluted that any other competitor I have tried. This makes writing strategies quick and easy. Thirdly, the backtesting is quick and massive amount of information is generated in order to analyze the results. The quantStats report is particularly useful. Installation and updating with docker is also extremely positive! I have yet to test a lot of things (live for instance), but so far, Jesse is the best and easiest framework I have encountered thus far, with relatively extensive support for different exchanges!\n\nIn the 10+ years I've been in crypto, I have tried upward of 50 or more different crypto trade bots and Jesse.trade is hands down one of the most unique platforms! Jesse.trade is a refreshing and unique concept of automated trading by providing users with a super easy platform install while being able to build your own trade strategies. Saleh is super responsive in his community and willing to listen to suggestions and requests. Looking forward to the continued growth of my crypto portfolio thanks to winning trades!\n\nI've known Jesse and Saleh since the project was still written in TypeScript. A lot has changed over the years, I've tried many bots and projects, and some have even been discontinued. Jesse is a framework that allows you to develop your own strategies in a simple yet extremely effective way, and with which you can potentially make trading decisions from any source or idea that comes to mind. Saleh is extremely helpful and the community is very active and welcoming. In the last couple of years, there have been great updates and I can't wait to see what's next. If you're serious about algorithmic crypto trading, then you can stop your search, Jesse will be your choice."

        "document": "In this blog: Use Python to visualize your stock holdings, and then build a trading bot to buy/sell your stocks with our Pre-built Trading Bot runtime .\n\nRecent trends in the global stock markets due to the current COVID-19 pandemic have been far from stable…and far from certain. The last time the market was this tumultuous, many people in the US and abroad lost a lot of money. But a few were fortunate enough to put themselves in a position to profit. The current situation will be no different.\n\nWhether you are a seasoned programmer just getting started with financial trading, or an experienced investor interested in discovering the power of Python, this article is for you. In it, I’ll demonstrate how Python can be used to visualize holdings in your current financial portfolio, as well as how to build a trading bot governed by a simple conditional-based algorithm.\n\nTo follow along with the code in this article, you’ll need to have a recent version of Python installed. I’ll be using a custom build of ActivePython that includes a version of Python and just the packages the project requires. You can get a copy for yourself by doing the following:\n• Download and install the “Trading Bot” runtime by doing the following:\n• Install the State Tool on Windows using Powershell:\n\n Or install State Tool on Linux or Mac:\n• Run the following command to download the build and automatically install it into a virtual environment:\n\n\n\nYou can find all of the code used in this article in my GitLab repository.\n\nAll set? Let’s dive into the details.\n\nThere are many different stock trading platforms out there, some with their own APIs. Robinhood offers a commision-free investing platform that makes trading simple and easy. Additionally, the robin–stocks package extends this simplicity over to Python, supporting features like stock trading, buy/sell options, and purchase cryptocurrencies, as well as giving access to real-time portfolio and market performance.\n\nTo follow along with this post, you’ll need to create a Robinhood account. Note that if you’re located outside the US, you’ll need to use another trading platform. In this case, the structure of the trading bot will be the same, but how you execute the trades will be different.\n\nTo get started, we’ll first import the packages we need and then log in to the Robinhood platform. Replace the and strings with your own account information:\n\nDepending on your security settings, you may require two-factor authentication. Once logged in, you can easily access your holdings by running:\n\nThe output is a dictionary that looks something like this:\n\nOf course, for bigger portfolios the output will be much longer. You can also access any of your profile information through the module:\n\nThere are a few more informative functions that can be used to extract information about your profile. They can be found in the documentation here.\n\nBefore we get to buying and selling, it is useful to build a visualization tool to observe historical changes in a given stock. The first thing I do is build a function that does exactly that.\n\nThe input is a list of tickers to plot, the time period over which to plot them (can be either , , , , , or ), and whether to include extended trading hours or just regular trading hours (can be or ).\n\nYou can customize the input ticker list, or use the function below to extract them from your holdings:\n\nSince I only have one stock in my holdings, only one plot is given. The plot looks like this:\n\nIn addition to plotting the opening price at each time interval (dark blue line), I’ve included the high and low price over the same time interval (light blue).\n\nIdeally, the trading bot should look at a predefined set of tickers within the portfolio and decide whether to buy, sell, or hold. The information that the bot uses to make this decision can be anything from how the price changes in a given time period to the sentiment analysis of a tweet from the CEO of the company.\n\nWhile there are many factors that can be taken into account, resulting in more sophisticated models for determining the bot conditionals, the base functionality of the bot doesn’t change. In our case, I’m simply using the attribute for each holding to determine whether or not to buy or sell. If the stock price has a drop over a certain percentage the bot will execute a buy. Conversely, if the stock price has a rise over a certain percentage the bot will execute a sell. To implement this behavior, I’ve defined a function:\n\nFirst, the bot pulls the holdings from the Robinhood platform and does some restructuring of the data to create a pandas dataframe. Then, it loops through each ticker present in and compares the value to the buy and sell conditional limits. For example, I can set both limits to 0.5%:\n\nThe bot will then execute a buy or sell if the value is less than or greater than half a percent, and prints out the transaction for each holding. Pretty cool right?\n\nThat’s it! You can now build your own trading bot using Python\n\nIn this article, I demonstrated how Python can be used to build a simple trading bot using packages like pandas and robin-stocks. By taking advantage of the Robinhood trading platform, you can easily visualize the performance of individual holdings within your portfolio.\n\nThe buy and sell conditions we set for the bot are relatively simplistic, but this code provides the building blocks for creating a more sophisticated algorithm. The versatility of Python offers the perfect playground for increasing the complexity by, for example, introducing machine learning techniques and other financial metrics. I leave these next steps to those readers interested in creating a more advanced bot.\n• All of the code used in this article can be found in my GitLab repository.\n• Sign up for a free ActiveState Platform account so you can download the Trading Bot runtime environment and build your very own trading bot"
