        "document": "ReactJS and TypeScript are powerful technologies that can be combined to create robust and type-safe applications. This tech document outlines the best practices to follow when using ReactJS with TypeScript. These practices aim to enhance code quality, maintainability, performance, and overall development experience.\n\nEnable strict mode in the TypeScript configuration to enforce strict type checking and catch potential errors at compile-time. This can be done by setting in the file.\n\n\n\nAlways provide type annotations for component props and state to ensure type safety and improve code readability. Use interfaces or types to define the shape of props and state objects.\n\n\n\nPrefer functional components over class components whenever possible. Use React hooks (e.g., , ) to manage state and lifecycle behavior in functional components.\n\n\n\nTake advantage of TypeScript's utility types to simplify common type transformations. Utility types like , , , and can be used to modify and compose types efficiently.\n\n\n\nAvoid using the type as much as possible. Instead, provide explicit types or use union types to handle cases where the type can be more than one possibility.\n\n\n\nUse custom types to represent different error states in asynchronous operations. This allows for more expressive error handling and ensures the proper handling of error cases.\n\n\n\nCreate generic components to enhance reusability and type safety. Generic components can handle different data types while maintaining type checking at compile-time.\n\n\n\nAvoid using type assertions ( ) unless absolutely necessary. Instead, leverage TypeScript's type inference capabilities and provide explicit types to ensure type safety.\n\n\n\nFollow consistent naming conventions for components, props, and variables. Use meaningful and descriptive names to improve code readability and maintainability.\n\n\n\nPrefer third-party libraries that provide TypeScript support and type definitions. TypeScript support ensures better integration with your codebase and helps catch potential issues early on.\n\nEnsure that the installed types match the library version and use the correct import statements to import types from the library.\n\n\n\nTo optimize ReactJS applications, consider the following techniques:\n• Use the Higher Order Component (HOC) to memoize functional components and prevent unnecessary re-renders.\n• Utilize the hook to memoize event handlers and prevent unnecessary re-creation of functions.\n• Use the hook to memoize expensive computations and avoid redundant calculations.\n\nConsider using the following component design patterns to structure your ReactJS\n• Container-Component Pattern: Separate container components (smart components) responsible for handling data and business logic from presentational components (dumb components) responsible for rendering UI elements.\n• Render Prop Pattern: Use the render prop pattern to share code and data between components by passing a function as a prop that returns JSX.\n• Higher-Order Component (HOC) Pattern: Use HOCs to add additional functionality or modify behavior of existing components.\n• Provider Pattern: Use React context API to provide data and state to multiple components without prop drilling.\n\nWhen handling events that can trigger frequent updates (e.g., scroll, resize), consider using debounce or throttle techniques to optimize performance and prevent excessive updates.\n\n\n\nUse conditional rendering techniques to control the visibility and behavior of components based on certain conditions. This can be achieved using conditional statements, ternary operators, or logical && operator.\n\n\n\nFollow the principle of immutability when updating state or props. Avoid directly mutating objects or arrays, as it can lead to unexpected behavior. Instead, create new copies of objects or arrays using immutable techniques like spread operators or immutable libraries.\n\n\n\nBy following these best practices, you can enhance your ReactJS with TypeScript projects, improve code quality, maintainability, and performance, and leverage the full potential of these technologies. Remember to adapt these practices based on your project's specific needs and requirements."

        "document": "From scoping to delivery, I automate your SDLC with features like requirement building, project planning, Figma-to-code conversion, and AI-powered coding assistance.\n\nRecently, there has been an increasing trend toward using React function components for building user interfaces.\n\nIn this post, we will break down everything you need to know about the React Function components.\n\nWhy are they preferred over class components?\n\nAnd the Importance of using TypeScript with React Function Components.\n\nThese are a type of component in the React JavaScript library that allow developers to create reusable pieces of code to build user interfaces. They are defined as plain JavaScript functions that return a React element or JSX (a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows for HTML-like code within JavaScript).\n\nThe React Function Components are typically used for simpler UI components and are favored due to the following reasons:\n• Simplicity, efficiency, and ease of use.\n• Lightweight and faster than class components in React.\n\nMoreover, with the introduction of React Hooks, function components have become even more powerful, allowing developers to use state and other React features without writing a class.\n\nWhy use React Function Components over Class Components?\n\nIn React, there are two types of components that can be used to build the user interface:\n\nWhile both types of components can achieve the same result, function components have become increasingly popular for a number of reasons.\n• Simplicity: Function components are simpler and easier to understand than class components. They are less verbose and have a lower cognitive load, making them easier to read and maintain. This simplicity also makes them easier to write and debug.\n• Performance: Function components are faster and more efficient than class components. They do not have the overhead of a class instance, which can lead to better performance in certain scenarios.\n• Hooks: Function components can leverage the power of React Hooks. Hooks are a new addition to React that allows you to use state and other React features without writing a class. They are more flexible and reusable than class components.\n• Functional Programming: Function components promote functional programming practices, which can lead to cleaner and more maintainable code. By focusing on pure functions, function components can be more predictable and easier to test.\n\n‍Future-Proofing: Function components are the future of React. React has been moving towards function components since the introduction of Hooks. While class components will still work in React, function components are likely to be the standard going forward.\n\nReact is the most popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and TypeScript is a powerful tool for adding type safety to JavaScript. Together, React and TypeScript can create scalable and maintainable applications.\n\nSo, let's explore some advanced TypeScript techniques for React function components to create robust and type-safe components.\n\nFunction components in React receive props as their first argument. TypeScript allows you to define the type of the props object. This provides better type safety throughout the component.\n\nBy defining the type of “Props”, we ensure that the component only receives the correct props. This approach helps to catch errors early and create more robust components.\n\nDefault props in React are values that are used if the prop is not explicitly provided. TypeScript can define the type of the default props object.\n\nBy using , we indicate that the “email” prop is optional. By defining the default props object with the “Partial” type, we ensure that the default props object only contains optional props. By setting the “defaultProps” object to “MyComponent.defaultProps”, we ensure that the default props are used when the component is rendered without the prop.\n\nReact components can receive children as props. TypeScript can define the type of the children prop.\n\nBy using “React.ReactNode”, we indicate that the component can receive any valid React node as its children. This approach helps to create reusable and flexible components.\n\nIn React, event handlers are commonly used to handle user interactions. TypeScript can define the type of event handlers.\n\nBy defining the type of the “onClick” prop, we ensure that the prop is an event handler for the “button” element. By using “void”, we indicate that the event handler does not return a value. This approach helps to create more predictable and maintainable code.\n\nIn React, refs are used to get a reference to a component or element. TypeScript can define the type of the ref.\n\nBy using , we indicate that the “inputRef” prop is a ref to an “input” element. This approach helps to create more reusable and flexible components.\n\nIn conclusion, these advanced TypeScript techniques for React function\n\nImportance of using TypeScript with React Function Components:\n\nTypeScript with React Function Components has several key benefits such as Type safety, Improved code readability, Better tooling, Easy collaboration, and Enhance scalability.\n\nWe can better understand this through the below example:\n\nImagine you're building a React app that allows users to search for and book flights. As you're building the app, you realize that the data structure for a flight reservation is quite complex, with nested objects and arrays.\n\nIf you were using plain JavaScript, you might run into issues with type mismatches or null values, which could cause runtime errors and impact the user experience.\n\nHowever, if you were using TypeScript with React Function Components, you could define interfaces that describe the shape of your flight reservation data, like so:\n\nBy defining these interfaces, you're not only making the code more readable and understandable, but you're also providing static type checking that can help catch errors early in the development process.\n\nFor example, if you tried to assign a string to the “passengers” property instead of an array of “Passenger” objects, TypeScript would raise an error and prevent the code from compiling. This can save you valuable debugging time and ensure that your code is always reliable.\n\nIn addition to type safety, TypeScript provides better tooling that can help improve developer productivity. For example, you can use Visual Studio Code to get autocomplete suggestions, hover over variables to see their type and more.\n\nOverall, using TypeScript with React Function Components is a powerful tool for building complex, scalable, and reliable React applications.\n\nUpgrade Your React App Development using Advanced TypeScript Techniques with DhiWise !\n\nIn the blog you have learned about the React Function Components, why they are preferred over the class components, the advanced TypeScript techniques, and the importance of using TypeScript with React Function Components.\n\nBy incorporating these techniques into your React development workflow, you can take your skills to the next level and build more robust, efficient, and scalable apps.\n\nMoreover, you can accelerate your app development with DhiWise React Builder .

        "document": "Combining the power of React with the type safety and scalability of TypeScript can significantly enhance the development experience and maintainability of your applications. In this article, we will explore best practices for using React with TypeScript, covering key areas such as component typing, state management, props validation, and tooling. By following these practices, you can harness the full potential of React and TypeScript, leading to more robust and error-free code.\n• Utilize TypeScript’s Generic Types: When creating React components, leverage TypeScript’s generic types to define the props interface for your components. This enforces strong typing and provides better documentation for component usage.\n• Prop Typing: Define prop types using TypeScript’s interfaces or types. Specify the required and optional props, as well as their types. Additionally, use TypeScript’s utility types, such as Partial or Omit, to handle complex or conditional props.\n• State Typing: Type the state of your React components using TypeScript’s interfaces or types. This helps ensure that state variables are correctly initialized and updated throughout the component lifecycle.\n• Use PropTypes Library: Consider using the PropTypes library, which is compatible with TypeScript, to perform runtime validation of props. This helps catch potential errors during development and provides more explicit documentation of prop types.\n\nThe PropTypes library provides a number of built-in validators that can be used to check the type, shape, and value of props. For example, the following code uses the validator to ensure that the prop is of type :\n• Custom Prop Validation: For complex or custom prop validation, define your own validation functions or use TypeScript’s type guards. This allows you to enforce specific constraints on prop values and ensure their correctness.\n\nFor complex or custom prop validation, you can define your own validation functions. For example, the following code defines a validation function that checks the length of the prop:\n\nTypeScript’s type guards can also be used to perform prop validation. For example, the following code uses the type guard to check if the prop is a string:\n• Choose Type-Safe State Management Libraries: When using state management libraries like Redux or MobX, opt for TypeScript-friendly alternatives such as Redux Toolkit or MobX with decorators. These libraries provide better TypeScript support and allow for more type-safe interactions with the state.\n• Define Strongly Typed Actions and Reducers: When working with Redux or similar libraries, define action types and payloads using TypeScript’s union types and interfaces. This ensures that actions and reducers are properly typed, preventing common runtime errors.\n• Non-Nullable Types: Utilize TypeScript’s non-nullable types (using the “!” operator or the NonNullable utility type) to prevent potential null or undefined errors. This helps catch common mistakes and ensures safer code execution.\n\nUsing the “!” operator: The operator can be used to convert a nullable type to a non-nullable type. For example, the following code converts the type to the type:\n\nUsing the NonNullable utility type: The utility type can also be used to convert a nullable type to a non-nullable type. For example, the following code uses the utility type to convert the type to the type:\n• Unknown Type: Leverage TypeScript’s unknown type when handling external data or untrusted sources. Use type guards and narrowing techniques to safely assert the type of unknown values before using them in your application.\n\nUsing type guards: Type guards can be used to safely assert the type of an unknown value. For example, the following code uses a type guard to check if the variable is of type :\n\nUsing narrowing techniques: Narrowing techniques can also be used to safely assert the type of an unknown value. For example, the following code uses narrowing to check if the variable is of type and then casts it to a :\n\nUsing the unknown type can help to handle external data or untrusted sources. For example, if you are receiving data from an API, you can use the unknown type to ensure that the data is of the correct type before using it in your application.\n• Use TypeScript-Specific Editors: Utilize TypeScript-aware editors like Visual Studio Code, which provide advanced autocompletion, type checking, and error highlighting features. These tools greatly enhance the development experience and catch potential errors in real-time.\n• Leverage TypeScript Compiler Options: Configure the TypeScript compiler options (tsconfig.json) to enforce stricter type checking rules and enable features like strictNullChecks and strictFunctionTypes. This ensures early detection of type-related issues and helps maintain code quality.\n• Generate TypeScript Definitions: If you are using third-party libraries without TypeScript support, use tools like TSDX or TSC to generate TypeScript declaration files (.d.ts) for better type inference and autocompletion."
