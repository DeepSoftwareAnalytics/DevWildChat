        "document": "In Vue.js, computed properties are a powerful feature that allows developers to define derived values based on reactive data. Computed properties in Vue 3 provide an elegant and efficient way to perform calculations, transformations, and data manipulations within your Vue components.\n\nIn this article, we will take a deep dive into Vue 3 computed properties, exploring their functionality, and use cases, and providing code examples along the way.\n\nComputed properties in Vue 3 are properties that are calculated dynamically based on other reactive properties. They are defined as functions and behave like data properties, but they are re-evaluated only when their dependencies change. Computed properties provide a clean and declarative way to derive values from existing data without the need for manual updates.\n\nBefore diving into computed properties, it's important to understand the difference between computed properties and methods in Vue components. While both computed properties and methods can perform calculations and return values, there are key distinctions between the two.\n\nMethods are functions that are called whenever they are referenced in the template or in the component's logic. They are re-evaluated every time the component renders, regardless of whether their dependencies change. This means that methods can be less performant than computed properties in scenarios where the same value is needed in multiple places within the template.\n\nOn the other hand, computed properties are cached based on their reactive dependencies. They are only recalculated when one of their dependencies changes. This caching mechanism ensures that computed properties have optimal performance, as they are not recalculated unnecessarily.\n\nTo define a computed property in a Vue 3 component, you need to use the function from the composition API. The function takes a getter function as its argument, which defines the logic for calculating the computed value. Here's an example:\n\nIn this example, we have two reactive properties, and . The computed property calculates the full name by combining the values of and . The function automatically tracks the dependencies of , so it will be re-evaluated whenever either or changes.\n\nOnce you have defined a computed property, you can access it in your component's template or logic just like any other data property. Vue will automatically handle the reactivity and caching for you.\n\nHere's an example of accessing the computed property in a template:\n\nIn this example, the computed property is rendered in the template using double curly braces ( ). Whenever or changes, the computed property will be automatically recalculated and updated in the template.\n\nIn addition to getters, Vue 3 computed properties also support setters. Setters allow you to update the value of a computed property, which in turn can trigger changes to its dependencies. To define a setter for a computed property, you need to provide an object with a and function to the function.\n\nIn this example, the computed property has both a getter and a setter. The getter calculates the full name based on and , while the setter allows you to update the full name by providing a string value.\n\nVue 3 computed properties use a caching mechanism to optimize performance. By default, computed properties are cached and only re-evaluated when one of their dependencies changes. This ensures that the computed property is recalculated only when necessary.\n\nHowever, there may be cases where you want to disable caching and force a computed property to re-evaluate on every access. To achieve this, you can use the function with a option set to .\n\nIn this example, the computed property is calculated based on the reactive property. However, by setting the option to , the computed property will be re-evaluated on every access, even if hasn't changed.\n\nNow that we have a solid understanding of computed properties in Vue 3, let's explore some common use cases and provide code examples to illustrate their application.\n\nComputed properties are excellent for performing dynamic formatting of data. For example, let's say you have a price value and you want to display it with a specific currency symbol and formatting.\n\nIn this example, the computed property calculates the price with a dollar sign and two decimal places. Whenever the changes, the will automatically update, reflecting the new formatting.\n\nComputed properties can also be used for filtering and sorting data dynamically. For instance, imagine you have an array of products and you want to filter them based on a specific category.\n\nIn this example, the computed property filters the array based on the . Whenever the changes, the will be automatically updated, showing the filtered products.\n\nComputed properties can also depend on other computed properties, allowing you to build complex data transformations.\n\nIn this example, the computed property calculates the total price based on the and . Then, the computed property further calculates a discounted price based on the . Whenever either or changes, both computed properties will be recalculated accordingly.\n\nComputed properties in Vue 3 provide a powerful and efficient way to derive values from reactive data. They allow you to perform calculations, transformations, filtering, sorting, and other data manipulations within your Vue components. By leveraging computed properties, you can keep your component logic clean, readable, and optimized for performance.\n\nIn this article, we explored the functionality of computed properties, including their definition, access, and usage of setters. We also discussed the caching mechanism of computed properties and how to control it. Additionally, we provided code examples that demonstrated various use cases, such as dynamic formatting, filtering and sorting data, and dependent computed properties.\n\nTo continue your learning journey with computed properties in Vue 3, make sure to consult the official Vue 3 documentation and other reputable resources for more in-depth information and advanced techniques."

One of the most useful features of Vue 3 is computed properties, which allow developers to perform complex calculations on their data and reuse the results as variables in their templates.\n\nVue 3 computed properties are a powerful tool that can significantly reduce the amount of code needed to achieve a particular functionality.\n\nTherefore, understanding Vue 3 computed properties is essential for developers who want to take full advantage of the framework's capabilities.\n\nComputed properties are similar to methods in Vue, but they are more efficient and can be cached to improve performance. They are also reactive, meaning that they update automatically whenever the data they depend on changes. This makes them ideal for handling complex calculations and transformations on data that is frequently updated.\n• None Vue 3 computed properties allow developers to perform complex calculations on their data and reuse the results as variables in their templates.\n• None Computed properties are more efficient and can be cached to improve performance compared to methods in Vue 3.\n• None They are reactive, meaning that they update automatically whenever the data they depend on changes, making them ideal for handling complex calculations and transformations on frequently updated data.\n\nComputed properties are a powerful feature of Vue 3 that allows developers to declaratively describe a value that is dependent on other values.\n\nThis feature allows for transformations or computations based on our data. We can reuse the result of these computations and transformations in our DOM template.\n\nIn a way, computed properties remove the need for complex in-template expressions.\n\nIn the Composition API, computed properties are defined using the function. The function expects to be passed a getter function, and the returned value is a computed ref. Similar to normal refs, you can access the computed result as . Computed refs are also auto-unwrapped in templates so you can reference them without in template expressions.\n\nHere's an example of how to use computed properties in the Composition API:\n\nIn the Options API, computed properties are defined using the property. To create a computed property, we need to add a computed property to our component object, much like the methods property.\n\nHere's an example of how to use computed properties in the Options API:\n\nBoth the Composition API and Options API provide a way to define computed properties, but the Composition API offers some additional benefits.\n\nWith the Composition API, we can define multiple computed properties in a single function, making it easier to organize our code. Additionally, the Composition API allows us to use reactive objects and functions, which can help improve performance by reducing unnecessary re-renders.\n\nWhether you choose to use the Composition API or Options API, computed properties can help simplify your code and improve performance.\n\nIn this section, I will provide an example of how to use computed properties in Vue 3. I always prefer to use the pattern when coding in Composition API.\n\nLet's say we have a simple Vue 3 component that displays a list of only published books. We can use a computed property to filter through the reactive array and always display only those that are published.\n\nWe can then use the computed property in our template by referencing it as . Note that we don't need to use to access the computed property in the template.\n\nOverall, computed properties are a great way to simplify your code and make it more readable by abstracting complex calculations into a single property.\n\nDifference Between Computed and Methods in Vue 3\n\nAs I have been working with Vue 3, I have come across two important concepts: computed properties and methods. While they may seem similar, there are some key differences between them.\n\nComputed properties are functions that return a value based on other reactive properties in the component. These properties are cached, meaning that they only update when their dependencies change. This makes them more efficient than methods in some cases.\n\nThey are accessed like data properties, without the need for parentheses.\n\nMethods, on the other hand, are functions that are called when an event occurs or when they are explicitly called in the component's template or script. They can also access reactive properties, but they do not have the caching behavior of computed properties.\n\nThey are accessed by calling them with parentheses.\n\nThe main difference between computed properties and methods is their caching behavior.\n\nComputed properties only update when their dependencies change, making them more efficient in some cases.\n\nMethods, on the other hand, are called every time they are accessed.\n\nAnother difference is how they are accessed. Computed properties are accessed like data properties, without the need for parentheses. Methods, on the other hand, are accessed by calling them with parentheses.\n\nIn general, computed properties are best used for values that are derived from other reactive properties, while methods are best used for handling events or performing other operations that are not dependent on reactive properties.\n\nOverall, understanding the difference between computed properties and methods is important for writing efficient and effective Vue 3 components.\n\nWhen working with Vue 3, two commonly used features are the and methods. Both methods are used to observe changes in data, but they have different functionalities.\n\nThe method is used to watch for changes in a specific data property. It can perform complex functions and asynchronous tasks. On the other hand, the method is used to calculate a value based on existing data properties. It is more performant than because it only updates when its dependencies change.\n\nOne example of using is to track the number of items in a user's shopping cart. On the other hand, an example of using is to calculate the total price of items in the cart.\n\nWhile both methods can achieve similar results, it is important to use them appropriately. Use when you need to perform complex functions or asynchronous tasks and use when you need to calculate a value based on existing data properties.\n\nWhen to Use Computed in Vue\n\nI use computed properties in Vue when I need to:\n• None Calculate derived data based on the state of the application\n• None Filter or sort data before displaying it in the view\n• None Perform expensive or complex calculations that should not be run on every re-render\n• None Define dynamic classes and use them in the template\n\nIn general, computed properties should be used when we need to perform calculations or transformations on reactive data. If the data is not reactive, we can use methods instead.\n\nBy using computed properties, we can keep our code clean and easy to read, while also improving performance.\n\nIt is important to note that computed functions should only perform pure computation and be free of any potential side effects.\n\nComputed properties in Vue are incredibly useful for manipulating data and updating the DOM in real time. In Vue 3, computed properties have become even more powerful with the introduction of computed setters.\n\nA computed setter is a function that is used to update the value of a computed property. This is different from a computed getter, which is used to calculate and return a value based on other data properties.\n\nTo define a computed setter in Vue 3, you need to use the function. Here's an example:\n\nIn this example, we have a computed property that has both a getter and a setter. The getter combines the and data properties to create a full name. The setter splits the parameter into first and last names and updates the corresponding data properties.\n\nTo use the computed setter, you simply assign a new value to the computed property:\n\nThis will trigger the computed setter, which will update the and data properties accordingly.\n\nComputed setters are a powerful tool for manipulating data in Vue 3. They allow you to create reactive computed properties that can be updated in real time, making it easy to build dynamic and responsive user interfaces.\n\nNote: Use computed setters only in rare cases.\n\nIn conclusion, Vue 3's computed properties are a powerful tool for creating reactive data that can be used in templates and other parts of your Vue app.\n\nBy using computed properties, you can easily manipulate and display data without having to write complex logic in your template or methods.\n\nWhen using computed properties, it's important to keep in mind that they should only be used for simple calculations and data transformations. If you need to perform more complex logic, it's better to use or other reactive features like .\n\nOverall, computed properties are a valuable tool in Vue 3, and can help you create more dynamic and efficient apps.
