Thanks!\n\nI have been trying to do convolution between two functions and I have been having a hard time trying to get it to work.\n\nI commented my issues with the code. I don't understand the difference of and in this case and how it would make a difference.\n\nFor the second comment, should have an amplitude of . While should have an amplitude of . When plotted, it only shows nothing in the locations specified but looks jumbled up at . I'm assuming that's the reason why the convoluted plot won't be displayed.\n\nThe original problem statement is given if it helps to understand what I was thinking throughout.\n\nConsider an input signal x(t) that consists of two delta functions at t = 1 and t = 4 with amplitudes A1 = 5 and A2 = 2, respectively, to a linear system with impulse response h that is an exponential pulse (h(t) = e ^âˆ’t ). Plot x(t), h(t) and the output of the linear system y(t) for t in the range of 0 to 10 using increments of 0.01. Use the MATLAB built-in function conv."

        "document": "I have voltage and current signals from multiple days. The time vector is in seconds of the day (SOD), and the voltage and current vectors are in volts and amps respectively. However, the vector data from each day is different lengths. For example Mondays data might be 1x100000 for both time and voltage/current, and Tuesdays might be 1x50000 for both time and voltage/current. I was asked to plot the different days of data on the same figure for comparison purposes. I have tried using the method but that obviously didn't work due to different vector lengths. I tried interpolating to the larger data set, but then realized that I will get all on the result since there is no overlap in time. I ran out of ideas and am desperately in need of help.\n\nEDIT: I guess I forgot to mention that somehow I would like to overlay them one on top of the other in the same figure and not using a subplot."
