The list of attributes in the column Attribute Properties , click the left mouse button on the icon . Depending on the mode change bidirectional, it will indicate the icon . Thus, when the value of the attribute group, and the parameter of the object is changed.\n\nSave the group of objects in the database by pressing the button save changes to database. Choose a location and name for the group (the default group name matches the specified value attribute Group Name). Click OK.\n\nGroup created and saved to the database. Now you can insert multiple grouped objects in a drawing, resizing and positioning of objects, while preserving established parametric and geometric constraints.\n\nWhen working with a group of attributes of the various available methods for selecting values. In the context menu of the column Properties attribute in the attribute list, select:\n\n· Add property from object - allows you to set the attribute value by linking it with an attribute value of another object in the drawing.\n\n· Set to unique string - allows you to set the attribute-counter, which will increase its value by 1 for each subsequent inserted marker. In the Value column for the visible attribute counter must specify a character string - prefix. The drawing will be appended to the prefix value of the counter.\n\n· Set to calculated field - allows you to set the attribute value using a mathematical expression, using references to other attributes of the marker and mathematical functions. In reference to another attribute marker use the name of the attribute recorded in braces.\n\n· Automatically increment - allows you to set the attribute-counter, which will increase its value to 1, compared with the same attribute of the previous insertion marker. This attribute allows the counter-repetition of identical values for several markers that distinguishes it from the attribute set to a unique value.\n\n· Set to simple field - sets the attribute type by default.\n\nInsert group may be carried out as the object manager , and with a tool insert group.\n\nIn the list of the group and press OK. If you insert a group of objects , you must specify the insertion point of the group. If you insert a group of dependencies , you need to select the drawing objects that you want to associate with the dependencies.\n\nIn the dialog box Insert group commands are available:\n\nDelete group. Deletes the selected group from the database.\n\nSelect items from the drawing for the group. Used to edit an existing or new group.\n\nSwitch multiple . Enables insertion of multiple groups in the drawing.\n\nSwitch Add group marker. If installed, together with a group of drawing a marker is added to the group.\n\nMarker group is designed for group editing and data to other objects in the drawing (see Binding arbitrary graphical and tabular data ).\n\nAfter you insert a group of objects in the drawing, or when the command to edit the marker group opens the edit dialog group.\n\nHighlight group objects. Highlights and centers on the screen objects in the group.\n\nEdit marker Properties. Includes editing mode, where you can change the set of objects in the group, add or remove attributes.\n\nObject tree. Enables and disables the object tree in the left pane.\n\nSet parameters table. This button is available if the group contains a table of parameters. In the dialog box, select the row attribute values, and click OK.\n\nGroup dependencies remain parametric description and assembly relationships between objects. When you insert such groups they are not added to the drawing objects, but only established the relationship between existing objects.\n\nConsider creating and maintaining relationships between the two cuffs.\n\nInsert the base of the two objects Cuff GOST 8752-79. Set between the geometric co-directional dependence Combining axis and the plane at a distance obj.B (see Constraints between two objects ) and the parametric dependence of the outer diameter.\n\n\n\nButton Creates group.

In marker may include parameters of individual parts group that can help you when pasting automatically change the geometry of the group of related components.\n\n\"Multiple insert\" allows you to create multiple copies of the selected group.\n\nIf a user group has been maintained by the standard in the folder $\\MCS\\Groups, then insert it in the tree by choosing the object manager.\n\nIf a group is defined form, then insert dialogue is as follows:\n\n· The dialog box includes a tree of groups - a list of objects and their parameters group. This tree can disable button\n\nWhen you click on you can switch to edit mode group settings.\n\nThe \"Marker\" tool is designed specifically to create a connection between an arbitrary graphic object (primitive) nanoCAD and a spreadsheet-specification. A universal marker is a translator of data from drawing objects into the nanoCAD Construction 23table by means of special means - marker attributes.\n\nMarker attributes can be visible or hidden. The values of the visible attributes are displayed in the drawing as text strings.\n\nThe marker, as an object nanoCAD Construction 23, can be saved in the object library and used repeatedly. The marker can also be included in the groups of objects nanoCAD Construction 23, providing the ability to specify the entire functional groups.\n\nLet's consider creating a marker in the form of a positional leader.\n\n2. Insert two text lines into the drawing and draw a horizontal line between them.\n\nThese objects will form a leader shelf template with two text labels. To use text strings as marker attributes, the first character must be \"$\".\n\n3. Call the command \"Add marker\", use a box or crossing box to select the objects that made up the marker.\n\n4. Snap the base point of the marker.\n\n5. The \"Creation of a marker\" dialog box appears. The properties table will list the attributes entered in the callout text boxes:\n\nColumn \"Name\" contains the working name of the attribute.\n\nIn column \"Value\" the values of the attribute are entered. Values can be either numeric or text. Auxiliary commands are available in the context menu of the \"Value\" column.\n\nColumn \"Attribute property\" is used to indicate the type of the input attribute. Various attribute labels are provided to indicate their type. The default is \"Set to simple field\".\n\n· Add property from object - allows you to set an attribute value by associating it with the attribute value of another object in the drawing.\n\nAfter choosing the type, it is suggested to select the object and the object attribute.\n\nAfter selecting an attribute, its value falls into the \"Value\" column, and in the \"Attribute property\" column the name of the selected attribute.\n\nAfter assigning an attribute, you can change the type of relationship with an object attribute:\n\nOne-way communication - changing the value in an attribute of an object affects the value of the marker.\n\nTwo way communication - changing the value in the marker affects the attribute of the object, and vice versa.\n\nBasic communication - an attribute of an object can only be changed from a marker. If the attribute is a table value in a basic relationship, the closest value from the table is displayed. The entered value will be displayed in brackets.\n\n· Set To Unique string - allows you to set a counter attribute that will increase its value by 1 for each subsequent inserted marker. In the \"Value\" column for the visible counter attribute, you can specify a character string - a prefix. In the drawing, the counter value will be appended to the prefix.\n\n· Set to calculated field - allows you to set the value of an attribute using a mathematical expression, using references to other marker attributes, operators, and mathematical functions. The name of the desired attribute is used as a reference to another marker attribute.\n\n· Automatically increment - allows you to set a counter attribute that will increase its value by 1 compared to the same attribute of the previous inserted marker. Such a counter attribute allows repetition of the same values for several markers, which distinguishes it from an attribute set to a unique value.\n\n· Set to simple field - sets the default attribute type to plain text.\n\n6. Edit the marker using the marker controls at the bottom of the dialog box.\n\n· \"Marker draw mode\". When you click on this button, a drop-down list of rendering modes appears:\n\nWhen you select the display method with the addition of a leader line, an additional button \"Arrow Type\" appears to select the type of arrow:\n\nClick this button and select the desired extension line arrow type.\n\nArrow display parameters are defined in the \"Settings - Symbols - Extension - Additional extension lines\" settings.\n\n· \"Unploted\". When this button is enabled, the marker is placed on a special layer that is not displayed when printing. When this mode is activated, the icon on the ( ) button changes and the marker is displayed in gray on the screen (in accordance with the color of the non-printed layer).\n\n· \"Show form editor\"- calls the custom form editor to create a dialog for working with marker attributes.\n\nThe following commands are available in the drop-down menu:\n\n\"Add Form. Adds additional forms, while the marker can change the appearance of the form, by condition or by the user's choice. By default, the marker has one form.\n\nThe form editor uses standard Windows form generation technology. The toolkit consists of three blocks - the graphic editor area, the toolbar with form objects and the properties window of the inserted elements. For inserted fields, the \"Field Name\" (\"Variable\") can be selected from the list of existing marker description fields. In this case, the default field value is equal to the field value in the marker description.\n\nWhen adding a second form, you are prompted to enter a name for the form. The variable Tag - mcFormName is added to the properties table. This variable is responsible for the name of the form, it can be set in a calculated field and, for example, made equal to execution. Empty or \"Main\" is considered the main form.\n\n· \"Geometry\". Used to change the appearance of the generic marker and define the insertion point.\n\nThe following commands are available in the drop-down menu:\n\nGet new geometry. The button is used to change the appearance of the universal marker and define the insertion point.\n\nAdd Implemetnation. Adds additional performances, while the marker can change its appearance, by condition or by the user's choice.\n\nWhen creating a new implementation, you are prompted to enter its name. When adding implementation, the Tag - mcImplementation variable is added to the properties table. This variable is responsible for the name of the current marker implementation. It can be set to a calculated field or linked to a list on a form. Empty or \"Main\" is considered the main implementation.\n\n· \"Set parameters table\". Opens the marker parameter table editor. When inserting a marker and having a table of values, it is possible to assign a group of values to the marker attributes.\n\nIn the list, select the parameters whose values will be selected from the table. In the right part of the window, enter the required number of lines with values. Close the dialog with the \"OK\" button.\n\n· Save changes to odatabase. The button is intended for writing a marker to library nanoCAD Construction 23.\n\n· Apply changes to all markers of this types. Applies changes to all markers of this type in the drawing. Serves for changing the marker template for all markers made according to this template and inserted into the drawing.\n\n7. If necessary, add any number of hidden attributes, filling in the rows of the table in sequence. The attribute is added in the bottom line of the table, marked with an \"*\" symbol.\n\n8. For future use of the marker, save it to the database as a named object.\n\nIn the \"Create element\" dialog box, specify the path to save, the name of the object and the note (for more information on working with the object base, see the nanoCAD Construction 23Object Manager). After you save the marker, a message appears prompting you to update the existing copies of the marker in the drawing.\n\n9. nanoCAD Construction 23 makes it possible to immediately apply the created marker. The command line prompts you to install the generated token. Pick an insertion point in the drawing. Identical markers can be simply copied in the future. In other cases, the marker is inserted directly from the base.\n\nEditing of a marker is carried out in a dialog box, the title of which corresponds to the name of the marker. For example, when you call for editing the \"Position_Marker\" marker, the creation of which was described in the previous paragraph, the dialog box will look like this:\n\nAdditional commands are located at the bottom of the window:\n\n· \"Marker draw mode\". When you click on this button, a drop-down list of rendering modes appears:\n\nWhen you select the display method with the addition of a leader line, an additional button \"Arrow Type\" appears to select the type of arrow:\n\nClick this button and select the desired extension line arrow type.\n\nArrow display parameters are defined in the \"Settings - Symbols - Extension - Additional extension lines\" settings.\n\n· \"Unploted\". When this button is enabled, the marker is placed on a special layer that is not displayed when printing. When this mode is activated, the icon on the ( ) button changes and the marker is displayed in gray on the screen (in accordance with the color of the non-printed layer).\n\n· \"Highlight info source object\". Highlights in the drawing the object with which the marker is associated (The function is available if the \"Add property from object\" mode is set for one or several attributes and the corresponding object was specified when inserting the marker).\n\n· \"Edit marker properties\". Turns on the edit mode, in which you can change the appearance of the marker, add or remove attributes.\n\nmcDefLayer - Controls the marker location layer. The \"Value\" field contains the name of the layer.\n\nmcShowFormOnInsert - Controls the display of the dialog when inserting. If the value is 0, the dialog is not shown when inserting. The value can be calculated.\n\nTemplate Wizard is designed to create easy to use tools of commonly used design elements drawing.\n\nWhen the command will be asked to select an object to create a template. If the object was preselected, then immediately start dialogue Template Wizard.\n\nButton Create template - creates a template in the database or applies the changes made in the editor.\n\nButton Create a new template - Creates a new template in the database based on the selected graphics and created form.\n\nConsider the example of creating a template signs of roughness. To do this, the drawing shall bear one designation:\n\nAfter you run the Wizard Templates chosen designation roughness.\n\nTo work with the template you must save it in the database that will be invited to do by pressing the button .\n\nThen click on the Create a form and create a form using the notation tools online forms.\n\nFor example, we can take two parameters - the first line designations and direction of irregularities. Both parameters are added to the form as a combo box (drag while holding Ctrl).\n\nAfter editing, we obtain the form of the following form:\n\nClose the form editor, click to update in template.\n\nTemplate will be saved in the database and will be displayed in the object manager.\n\nNow when you insert from the database will be able to also place the designation of roughness on the shelf line-outs, but when you edit your form will appear:\n\nIf the original graphics selected block nanoCAD, its attributes are also displayed in the form editor as available variables.\n\nWhen creating a form in the database and maintaining such a block is inserted into the drawing as a block of the same source, only the attributes can be set up via a custom form.\n\nThe command switches the display mode of hidden lines.\n\nnanoCAD Construction 23 allows you to hide individual graphics elements. The overlapping nature of the base object or user block is determined by a special parameter - the overlap level ZOrder. ZOrder - this is a numeric parameter whose value determines the overlap priority. An object with a large ZOrder value overrides an object with a lower value.\n\nPrimitives nanoCAD have the lowest overlapping level and therefore are always overlapped by objects from the database. That at an insertion of object nanoCAD Construction 23 objects nanoCAD did not overlap, it is necessary to disable the switch in the object insert dialog \"Cover primitives\":\n\nThe area in the drawing that the base object covers nanoCAD Construction 23, is called \"Contour of suppression\". An overlap exists within this contour.\n\n2. In the context menu, select the desired view of the overlapped objects \"Normal\", \"Dotted\" or \"Switch\".\n\n3. Select the secant frame for the objects for which you want to change the overlapping mode.\n\n4.

Select the objects you want to move up;\n\n3. Select the objects to be compared;\n\n4. After the selection is complete, the objects that need to be moved up will automatically increase the overlap level (ZOrder).\n\n2. Select the objects you want to move down;\n\n4. After the selection is complete, the objects that are to be moved down will automatically decrease the overlap level (ZOrder).\n\nThe command allows you to trim objects of metal structures.\n\n2. Pick an outline. A contour can be a line segment, circle, arc, polyline (closed and open).\n\nIf a circle or closed polyline is used as a path, the trimming object is selected within the path.\n\nIf a linear path is used, the trimming object is selected from one side of the path.\n\n4. Press the \"Esc\" button to end trimming. The object will be trimmed.\n\nAllows for trimming at the desired angle.\n\n5. Pick the size of the outline.\n\n3. Pick the center of the hole.\n\n2.

If enabled, strings are transferred.\n\nTables BuildIndustry support the use of additional variables defined in a special dialog (form).\n\nProcedure for creating a set of user-defined variables and their use in the table below:\n\n1. In full table editor from the menu Edit invoke the command Form Editor.\n\n2. Create a form with controls and bind each control to a field (variable). More information about the forms, see Form Editor .\n\n3. Close the form editor and save the form.\n\n4. To set the variable, call the command form.\n\n5. Open your form. Enter the desired values. Click OK.\n\n6. Linking table cells with custom variables by using formulas.\n\nCell value will be associated with the variable.\n\nVariables can also be used in complex formulations.\n\nReports are necessary in order to organize the data of objects in the drawing.\n\nTo create a report in the table editor, call the command from \"Main menu - Section - Insert Report section\". The command will create a subsection \"Report template\".\n\nAdditional subsections are added using the \"Report template\" menu: \"Report title\", \"Report Summary\".\n\nHeader and footer sections are added from \"Main menu - Section\".\n\nThe report template defines the content and appearance of the report; it can consist of one or several lines. A separate copy of the report lines is created for each object. Formulas in the report are calculated using the properties of the selection objects.\n\nThe following commands are available in the \"Report template\" menu (click on the subsection name):\n\n· \"Object filter...\" - opens the \"Quick Selection\" dialog for forming a selection of drawing objects. The command is duplicated by the \"Select source objects\" button on the right in the \"Report template\" section.\n\n· \"Merging and Grouping...\" - opens the \"Row grouping and merging\" dialog in which the parameters of grouping and merging table cells are configured. The command is duplicated by the \"Group and merge\" button on the right in the \"Report template\" section.\n\n· \"Freeze report\" - the switch controls the report refresh mode. If the checkbox is selected, the update is performed manually, and the \"Update report\" command becomes available.\n\n· \"Update report\" - refreshes the values of report objects, the command is available in manual refresh mode.\n\n· \"Report header\" - adds a \"Report Title\" subsection to the beginning of the report, displayed at the beginning of each part of the table.\n\n· \"Append Data section\" - adds a data section below the report. If the section already exists, an additional line is appended.\n\n· \"Append Report section\" - adds a new report below the current one.\n\n· \"Remove Report\" - deletes the report with all associated subsections.\n\n· \"Rebuild\" - completely rebuilds the report based on the report template. Data entered manually in the \"Report\" section will be overwritten.\n\n· \"Convert to Data section\" - the command converts sections of the report to data. Blank lines are not converted. Calling the command opens the \"Conversion options\" dialog.\n\n· \"Report footer\" - Adds the \"Report Summary\" subsection to the end of the report, displayed after each part of the table.\n\nAll related subsections of the report are visually combined with brackets.\n\nThe \"Report\" displays the values of the template variables.\n\nThe report contains cells (with a lilac background) containing object data, marked with a special color. Selecting cells highlights the corresponding objects in the drawing.\n\nWhen editing such cells, the changes will be applied to the very object to which they refer. For instance:\n\n1. Take a Bolt GOST 7795-70 with a length of 50 mm and place a leader on it.\n\n4. Enter the new length, for example 120. Close the table editor.\n\n5. The length of the bolt in the drawing has changed.\n\nThe following commands are available in the \"Report Title\" menu (click on the subsection name):\n\nThe following commands are available in the \"Report Summary\" menu (click on the subsection name):\n\nIn the context menu of the \"Report Summary\" cells, there are the following additional commands: \"Sum\", \"Average\", \"Minimum\", \"Maximum\", \"Count\".\n\nThe commands insert into the selected cell corresponding to the name of the expression. The action is applied to a fragment of a column within one section.\n\n1. Call up the \"Quick Selection\" dialog box. Use the \"Filter Objects...\" command of the \"Report Template\" menu or the \"Select Source Objects\" button on the right in the \"Report Template\" section.\n\n2. Use the \"Quick Selection\" dialog to filter the objects and click the \"OK\" button. The selected objects will be associated with the report.\n\n3. Select a cell in the \"Report Template\" section. In the context menu of the cell, the parameters of the related objects will be available for insertion.\n\n5. Select an option from the context menu. The \"Report\" subsection will be automatically created. The number of lines in the \"Report\" subsection corresponds to the product of the number of related objects and the number of template lines.\n\nThe report template can consist of several lines. To add rows in the context menu of the \"Report Template\" row, use the \"Add Row\" or \"Insert Row\" commands.\n\nRows in a report template can be combined. Changes will be displayed in the \"Report\" section. Let's consider a join using the example table below:\n\n· Select cell A1:A2 and select the \"Group\" command from the context menu. The selected cells will be grouped.\n\n· In the \"Report template\" menu (click on the subsection name), select the \"Rebuild\" command. The table will look like this:\n\n6. Fill in all the required cells of the \"Report Template\".\n\n7. The sample is formed. Close the table editor. Changing the parameters of objects in the drawing will change the values in the report.\n\nIn the Grouping and merging dialog you can specify settings for grouping and merging table cells. Grouping and merging are only applied to cells in the report template.\n\nStudy the example for how to merge cells.\n\n1. In the Grouping and merging dialog box select Append rule and select Merge.\n\n2. Select the column name for the cells you want to merge. Selection is made by double clicking on the column name or by dragging it into the Select field.\n\nThe columns are processed according to the rules of the grouping remplate.\n\n3. If you want to sort, select and don't sortand sorting, and select sort type.\n\n4. Click OK to check the result in the table editor. Cells having identical values in the D column will be merged.\n\n1. In the dialog box groupings and click Add Rule select Group.\n\n2. Select the name of the column whose cells you want to group. Choice is either by double-clicking on the column name, or by dragging it into the Select .\n\n3. If you want to sort, click on the link and sorting, and select the type of sort.\n\n4. Click OK to view the results in the table editor. Table rows that contain the same values ??in column C, will be grouped.\n\nThe Formula Editor (Expression Builder) allows you to set parameters, arithmetic expressions, and object property references for a selected table cell.\n\n· By clicking on the \"fx\" button in the formula bar;\n\nThe dialog box consists of the \"Expression Input Field\", \"Formula Templates\", \"List of Registered Functions\", \"Quick View Fields\" and the \"Attach object\" button.\n\nThe \"Attach Object\" button allows you to attach to objects.\n\nAt the top of the dialog there is an expression input field, with which you can manually enter any arithmetic expressions, as well as use reserved variables and object properties.\n\nWhen entering manually, a list of functions and variables containing the word being entered appears in the list of reserved functions; syntax is also checked. If the formula is incorrect, an error warning or hint will appear in the Quick View.\n\nIn the quick view field, by clicking the mouse on an expression, the text in the input field related to this expression is selected.\n\nWhen you click on the button in the \"Expression input field\", the entered expression is saved on the formula templates panel for quick recall. Pressing the button again removes the expression from the formula template.\n\nThe \"Reserved Functions List\" contains recently used expressions that are highlighted in yellow. When you click on the button, expressions are saved in the Formula Templates panel for quick recall. Expressions that are in the Formula Template Bar in the Reserved Functions list will be marked with an asterisk. Pressing the button again removes the expression from the formula template.\n\nWhen you hover the cursor over the button of the saved template, a tooltip will appear with the contents of this template.\n\nIn order to insert an expression from the \"Formula template\", place the cursor in the required position, press the button with the template.\n\nTo delete an expression template, click the triangle button and uncheck the required template in the list that appears.\n\nIn the formula, you can use any cell values of the properties of another object. If using automatic recalculation of the table, the formula object is automatically recalculated. Each cell can attach one or more objects. Objects are named Object1, Object2, and Object3, … sequentially numbered in the table. If the object is not used in a formula, it will detach from the table at the next calculation, and the object references are renumbered.\n\nBinding properties for drawing objects to a single cell then use the expression or the keys Shift+F2. Available in the context menu of the selected cell.\n\nAfter selecting the command window opens the Expression Builder.\n\nSelect the object whose data you want to send to the table (eg, Bolt M52). Now the list of expressions appears in the properties of the selected object. Double-clicking on the property (select Object.Name), adds it to the text in a cell. Click OK.\n\nAfter connection of the facility to the cell the cell color changes (it says that the formula in the cell) and it will display the calculated result, in this case the name of the object:\n\nCos, Sin, Tg - trigonometric functions, the argument given in degrees.\n\nAcos, Asin, Atg - inverse trigonometric functions, the result is given in degrees.\n\nSumm - returns the sum of the values of the variables in a grouped cells.\n\nSumm(Row) - returns the sum of the numbers of grouped rows..\n\nSumm(Standartnaya_detal.L) - returns the sum of the values ??of the L parameter object \"standard part\" in the grouped rows.\n\nFrm - convert a numeric value to a string formatted according to the settings of a table column.\n\nFrm(0.001230) returns a string 0,0012, if the column containing the cell is set to zero suppression and accuracy of 0,0000\n\nLogich_Uslovie - logical condition using logical comparisons (see above);\n\nEsli_istina - the return value when the logical condition;\n\nif(object == Marker_universalny; Marker_universalny.position; \"Undefined\") . If an object type, which is connected with the cell column has Marker_universalny value, the function returns the position value of the referenced object. Another type of object it returns a string Undefined .\n\nExist - Checks whether there is a constant: =IF(EXIST(Object.Name);Object.Name;0)\n\nMin/Max - returns the minimum / maximum value listed in parentheses\n\nCount - returns the number of objects (for grouped rows in the table).\n\nCount() - returns the number of objects associated with cells grouped rows.\n\nAvg - Calculates the arithmetic mean of the arguments. Takes an arbitrary number of arguments understand ranges. Empty arguments are ignored.\n\nOff - returns the value of the cell, given the relative index. The index is written in the format:\n\nOff(-1;2) - returns the value of cell in the table on one line above (-1) and two columns to the right (2) of the current\n\nCell - the cell returns the value specified absolute index.\n\nMerge (Cells,Expression) - brings together a range of Cells, if Expression is not equal to 0. Returns the value of Expression.\n\n=merge(A5:C5; \"Title\") – integrates cell A5 to C5, in the summary displays the text \"Title\".\n\nSetHeight() – reference line height. In brackets the height value.\n\nVal() - computes the value of the argument.\n\n=val(\"A\"+\"1\") - calculates the \"A1\", and then uses it as another expression (obtained by the value in cell A1). If the argument - not a string, then he comes back, ie =val(10+2) - the same thing =10+2.\n\n=val(\"summ(A\"+Str(off(0;-1))+\":D\"+Str(off(0;-1))+\")\") - the amount of cells from rows A to D, the number which is introduced into the cell to the left of the current one. In most cases you can do without val. The classic example, when without it - no way: in a custom form, enter the cell address, then to take the value out of it. Create a variable Addr, associate it with an input field on a form and in the table do so: = val (Addr) function allows recursion: = val (val (\"A\" + \"1\")) - to take the value of the cell whose address is recorded in cell A1. Nesting depth is limited to 64.\n\nGeometry(Object) - works as Implement object. Height embedded object shrinks to the line height. Object is taken from the report, or attached to the cell.\n\nSUMM(Section(-1)) - Sum of cells in the current column of the section next to the current.\n\nCOUNT(Section(A3)) - The number of rows in the section containing the cell A3.\n\nRow - for each cell in the column it returns the number of rows (rows are numbered starting with 1, excluding the header lines).\n\nCol - for all cells in a column returns the column number of the table (column \"A\" is number 1).\n\nObject - returns the type of the object, which is associated with the cell line.\n\nTitle - the name of the table.\n\nThe \"Split the table by pages\" tool is similar to the \"Division by page\" editor tool, but the result is not a split single table, but several separate tables.\n\n2. In the places where the break will be, set the break with the command \"Start new page\".\n\n5. From the context menu, select the \"Split table by pages\" command.\n\n6. The table will be split into separate tables. The separation will occur at the places of the established breaks.\n\n· Filling in the fields of the title block\n\nEach format type is an element of the database nanoCAD Construction 23, which is located in the folder \"Drawing border templates\" library nanoCAD Construction 23.\n\nemplates major labels and additional fields are located in the subfolder formats \"Title block templates\". Renaming or deleting existing items in the folder \"Drawing border templates\" would make it impossible to insert existing formats.\n\nInsert the format by clicking on the icon Drawing title/borders. This dialog box appears Format:\n\nThis window is defined by:\n\nAfter selecting the type of document, as well as the size and orientation of the sheet is inserted into the selected format.\n\n· To edit the frame size, double-click the left mouse button on the contour of the frame.\n\n· To edit the text in the title block, double-click on the text of the left mouse button.\n\n· To edit entries in the title block, double-click the left mouse button on any line of the title block.\n\nIf you remove the first sheet of the scope of its information from the title block is automatically transferred to the second sheet.\n\nTo save the settings template attached stamps and their parameters in the database, click on the button , then enter the path stored in the database and the template name.\n\nTo change the line frames the template files, edit the frames and other fields.\n\n\"Document Type\" - Select the document type from the list format template in section database. Depending on the document type is changed appearance and availability of individual dialog items \"Format\".\n\n\"Format\" - the choice of the size of the sheet on the basis of standard size and multiplicity (not available for the types of documents based on the standard ISO, because the multiplicity inherent in the choice of format).\n\n\"Leaf\" - the choice of template title block for the first or subsequent sheets.\n\n\"Autonumerate from\" - Automatic Numbering sheets. It lets you specify the number of the first sheet.\n\n\"Use zones from\" - avtoprostanovka zones. It lets you specify the number of the first zone.\n\nAfter you select the document type and size under the proposed set the insertion point of the frame. If you press Enter or right mouse button, the lower left corner of the frame is aligned with the coordinate 0,0.\n\nSet default stamps - restores the template format those stamps which were overwritten while maintaining format template database.\n\nFilling in the fields of the title block\n\nTo fill the title block fields and additional graph, double-click on any line of the title block.\n\nThe main inscription is filled directly into the dialog box, \"Stamp\"\n\nWhile filling in the title block previously entered information stored in the section \"History\" menu. To open the context menu, place the cursor in an editable field and click the right mouse button.\n\nRecent values can be saved in the section \"Recent\" menu.\n\nThe command saves the current filling of the stamp in the memory. In the following fields will be filled automatically stamp\n\nThe command opens a drop-down menu to change the pattern of the stamp.\n\nMaster recognition format enables automatic search and replace formats created from individual primitives nanoCAD, transforming them into an object of the \"Format\" nanoCAD Construction 23. Initial primitives are in the drawing.\n\nRecognition takes place in two phases: the first searches for the formats in their dimensions, the second selected title block. Selection is made by comparing the serial patterns of stamps from the library with the existing geometric objects in the drawing. The remaining seals are installed by default. After the successful recognition format graphs stamps are automatically filled with values from the drawing, and the format is placed on the current layer.\n\nBefore you create a custom size or stamp is necessary to draw a pattern nanoCAD means in accordance with the required desired view object being created. When drawing templates should adhere to the following rules:\n\n· The template can contain lines, arcs, and circles, text (single-line and multi-line), the objects of the library of standard parts nanoCAD Construction 23, blocks nanoCAD;\n\n· the thickness of the lines that are assigned to the template thickness is not equal to zero, and not \"layer\" to be adopted in accordance with the thickness of the closest standard value;\n\n· the color lines and text included in the template will be saved according to the selected values;\n\n· multiline text (mtext) is inscribed in the boundaries of the rectangular area of text is selected when you create it.\n\nYou can use overhead lines and graphic objects, which are not drawn when inserting format or stamp in the drawing.\n\nTo install a drawing object as a service, use the button \"Set parameter\" toolbar MechWizard, select the object, and in the dialog \"Object properties\" check the box \"Is a working object\":\n\n· Use the links in the templates\n\nUse the links in the templates\n\nCustom format may contain links to templates stamps available in the library. To add a stamp in the format used by the relevant rules.\n\nStamp Position and orientation when you insert a drawing format will be determined by the insertion point and orientation of text links:\n\nthe figure shows the format template added referring to stamp basic inscription. When you insert a drawing format drawn stamp recorded in the library under the specified name.\n\nthe format can be added to any number of references to the stamps from the library.\n\nIn the pattern of the stamp may be used special signage text fields.\n\nText added to the template and starting with the single character \"$\", is recognized as a reference pointer on the field (the Count) input. In the input field of the dialog box, you can edit the stamp to record the text (for example, the name of the developer or check). Name field can contain characters of the Latin alphabet and the national or spaces. Dimensions of the input fields are defined primitives surrounding the insertion point, the reference index. If you found another symbol \"$\", the text after it considered the description field:\n\nthe contents of the text box will be displayed in the list of object properties.\n\nTo limit the size of the input field or eliminate overlapping fields in the dialog, you can use the service line.\n\nTo create a stamp based on an existing base in the sample, the sample to be inserted into the drawing by setting in the dialog box \"Stamp\" mode \"Display field names\" . After insertion into the drawing die can be used as the layout of the new stamp.\n\nStandard fields stamps have a description in Russian (GOST), English (ISO) or German (DIN) language, the values of the fields available in the list of object properties.\n\nIn the pattern of the stamp can be used table nanoCAD Construction 23. Included in the stamp table when you insert a drawing can be edited as regular tables nanoCAD Construction 23 (except that the die table can not be modified in the editing mode screen).\n\nConverting from previous versions - In file defined fields for name mapping formats of old and new versions. If an entity applies the custom stamps of previous versions, the names of the fields, you can add them into the appropriate section of this file.\n\nTables - Format allows you to use tables as stamps. This preserves virtually all the functionality built-in table.\n\nUniversal marker - The values of any fields format can be used in a universal marker.\n\nDimensions - When you create within the format size, the size takes out set in the title block of the format.\n\nLegend roughness - The format may be associated with the designation of a roughness surfaces unspecified. Icon roughness is automatically transferred to the upper right corner of the format.\n\nProperty document - The value of the standard field format is synchronized with the attributes of the file in which it was created.\n\nTechnical conditions - Format calculates the coordinates of the columns to accommodate the technical requirements.\n\nAttribute documents TechnologiCS - Exchange values between the fields and the format of the document attributes. You can set the matching fields automatically (by the same name), and then specify manually. Establishing appropriate stored for later use.\n\nZone format - The format can be calculated, is there any point in it. If so, you can receive the designation area containing the point.\n\nTo change the existing format, select it from the drop-down list of templates. The field, located in the center of the panel will be a general view of the selected format.\n\nTo add a new format, select the drop down list \"Template name\" paragraph (new).\n\nClick the left mouse button on the center field, select the drawing created by pre-layout format template, and confirm the selection click OK.\n\nIn the dialog box \"Format creation\" will be recognized image format.\n\nIf you create a new format after closing the dialog box by pressing OK, a dialog \"Create element\", which follows the format and select the name of the folder in the library of standard parts, which will save the created format:\n\nBy default the path \"DB \\ Drawing borders template\". If you want to keep the format in another folder, press and select the folder that appears in your browser.\n\nCreating a template format is similar to creating templates stamps. Embedded tables are not supported. The texts, starting with the single \"#\" character, determine the type and position of the stamp format. When you insert the size of the database will be loaded stamped with the name specified in the text (the symbol '#' is ignored and the text \"main message\" will be replaced with the box on a stamp with the name of \"Title Block\"), if it is in base. If the name starts with \"$\" and contains only hexadecimal digits, it is interpreted as UID template stamp in the database. Coordinates, direction and alignment of the text will be applied to the stamp.\n\nPredefined templates are stored in the formats \"DB \\ Drawing borders template\". It is recommended that the new template is stored in the same folder, but when loading the template can be seen the whole base.\n\nFrame custom format has a fixed size - the one set in the template. There is a special recognition mode that allows the use of standard scalable framework with their stamps. To enable this mode, select from the list in the dialog master the standard by which the frame will be built. In this mode, all of the graphics in the template are ignored, except for text and bounding box. The frame can be of any size - in the final format it replaced with standard frame. All texts are considered names stamps. There are two variants of binding stamps:\n\n· If the text begins with the \"#\" symbol, it is stored offset from the insertion point to the nearest corner of the bounding box.\n\n· If the symbol \"#\" no stored offset from the text insertion point to the bottom left corner of the bounding box.\n\nTo change an existing stamp, select it from the drop-down list of templates.\n\nTo add a new format, select the drop down list \"Template name (new)\".\n\nA template stamp can have up to four different graphical representations: simple and full (advanced) type, including the form of the first sheet and the view for subsequent sheets.\n\nSelect one of the tabs: \"Simple view\" or \"Extended view\". Click the left mouse button on one of the fields marked with a stamp type, and select the drawing template you created earlier mock punch. Confirm the selection click OK.\n\nIn the dialog box \"Create stamp\" will be recognized image of the stamp.\n\nIf you create a new stamp, after closing the dialog box by pressing OK, a dialog \"Create element\", where you must enter the name of the stamp, and choose a library of standard parts folder in which to save the template created by the stamp:\n\nNew templates stamps recommend that you save to the folder \"DB \\ Drawing borders template \\ Title block templates\".\n\nIf the layout for the die table to use, it will retain its editing capabilities even being introduced to the format. For these tables are only supported editing in place.\n\nThe pattern die may be up to four types:\n\n· the main type of the first sheet,\n\n· an expanded view of the first sheet,\n\n· an expanded view of the next sheet.\n\nThe texts, starting with the single character \"$\" are recognized as the names of the fields. The editing dialog stamp they will be displayed in the form input fields. Name field can contain spaces and extended characters. Dimensions of the field defined primitives surrounding the point of its insertion. If you found another symbol \"$\", the text after it considered the description field. This text will be displayed in the list of properties:\n\nTo limit the size of the field or eliminate overlapping fields in the dialog, you can use the service line. This is a primitive with zero thickness or line marked as the utility from mcWizParam. Set the parameter.\n\nIf you set daw \"Work object\", then stamped on tobrazhatsya these primitives will not.\n\nTo create a stamp based on an existing base in the sample, the sample to be inserted into the drawing, and in his dialogue press \"Show Field Names\". View selected stamp button \"View\".\n\nAfter that, the object can be divided (explode), edited and used as the layout.\n\nThe dialogue is a choice of the standard, which is taken from a stamp. This standard is used for the selection of the frame formats in recognition of the primitives.\n\nA distinctive feature of nanoCAD Construction 23 is the possibility of linking the designation of textual information on the drawing with the text in the technical requirements.\n\nWhen writing paragraphs of technical requirements (hereinafter TC), you can make reference within the proposal of the paragraph of technical requirements to any position or affixed view.\n\nThe textual information is the tolerances and dimensions, drawing zones, designations of types, cuts, sections, marking signs, marking of welded joints, position.\n\nA change in the value of the textual information (for example, a part position number) will result in an automatic change in the TC text. If this position has been deleted, a warning will appear about the need to check a particular item of requirements.\n\nThe relationship between the TC and the designation works in the opposite direction. Changing the order of the points of the requirements (their numbering) is automatically reflected in the designation on the drawing (for example, a marking mark, the designation of which contains the item number from the technical requirements).\n\n· Open file - the command opens the TC from a previously saved file.\n\n· Close without save - the command closes the TC editing dialog box without saving.\n\n· Open file - the command opens the TC from a previously saved file.\n\n· Fill in MSWord - the command opens a new document in MSWord and inserts the text TC.\n\n· Replace paragraph up - the command moves the TC item at which the cursor is located, higher up in the list.\n\n· Replace paragraph down - the command moves the TC item at which the cursor is located, down the list.\n\n· Decrease Indent - the command reduces the indent of selected items.\n\n· Line Spacing - the command opens the list for setting the line spacing.

When called, the \"Tolerances\" dialog box opens.\n\n· Insert material - provides the ability to insert material. When called, opens the \"Material\" dialog.\n\n· Insert spec symbol - allows you to insert special characters in the text TC.\n\n· Numeration - the command allows you to select the design option for TC items.\n\n· Insert view/cuts - the command associates text fragments in TC with a graphical representation of views, sections and sections in the drawing.\n\nTo insert a link in the TC editor, place the cursor on the insertion point of the associated symbol and click on the \"Insert view / cuts\" button, select the view, section or section.\n\nRelated information is displayed in blue in the TC editor. When you click on a link, the application will display the associated graphical representation.\n\n· Ruler. The ruler is used to position the lines relative to the entire TC document. Sliders are used to position the lines.\n\n1. The bottom slider adjusts the indentation of all paragraph lines except the first line.\n\n2. The top slider adjusts the indent of the first paragraph line.\n\n3. The angle slider adjusts the text indent from the numbered list marker.\n\nThe context menu uses standard commands for text fields.\n\nTo set the TC text parameters (font height and slope, indent from the title block, etc.) open the dialog box \"Settings\".\n\nWorking with the technical description editor is similar to working with the TC editor. The main difference is that the typed text can be placed anywhere in the drawing.\n\n· Open file - the command opens the TP from a previously saved file.\n\n· Close without save - the command closes the TP editing dialog box without saving.\n\n· Open file - the command opens the TP from a previously saved file.\n\n· Fill in MSWord - the command opens a new document in MSWord and inserts the text TP.\n\n· Replace paragraph up - the command moves the TP item at which the cursor is located, higher up in the list.\n\n· Replace paragraph down - the command moves the TP item at which the cursor is located, down the list.\n\n· Decrease Indent - the command reduces the indent of selected items.\n\n· Line Spacing - the command opens the list for setting the line spacing. Adjust line spacing of selected items.\n\n· 1 - set 1 leading (unit for measuring line spacing). Line spacing is added after the TP item.\n\n· 1.5 - set 1.5 leading.

Initial primitives are in the drawing.\n\nRecognition takes place in two phases: the first searches for the formats in their dimensions, the second selected title block. Selection is made by comparing the serial patterns of stamps from the library with the existing geometric objects in the drawing. The remaining seals are installed by default. After the successful recognition format graphs stamps are automatically filled with values from the drawing, and the format is placed on the current layer.\n\nBefore you create a custom size or stamp is necessary to draw a pattern nanoCAD means in accordance with the required desired view object being created. When drawing templates should adhere to the following rules:\n\n· The template can contain lines, arcs, and circles, text (single-line and multi-line), the objects of the library of standard parts nanoCAD Mechanica23, blocks nanoCAD;\n\n· the thickness of the lines that are assigned to the template thickness is not equal to zero, and not \"layer\" to be adopted in accordance with the thickness of the closest standard value;\n\n· the color lines and text included in the template will be saved according to the selected values;\n\n· multiline text (mtext) is inscribed in the boundaries of the rectangular area of text is selected when you create it.\n\nYou can use overhead lines and graphic objects, which are not drawn when inserting format or stamp in the drawing.\n\nTo install a drawing object as a service, use the button \"Set parameter\" toolbar MechWizard, select the object, and in the dialog \"Object properties\" check the box \"Is a working object\":\n\n· Use the links in the templates\n\nUse the links in the templates\n\nCustom format may contain links to templates stamps available in the library.

When you insert a drawing format drawn stamp recorded in the library under the specified name.\n\nthe format can be added to any number of references to the stamps from the library.\n\nIn the pattern of the stamp may be used special signage text fields.\n\nText added to the template and starting with the single character \"$\", is recognized as a reference pointer on the field (the Count) input. In the input field of the dialog box, you can edit the stamp to record the text (for example, the name of the developer or check). Name field can contain characters of the Latin alphabet and the national or spaces. Dimensions of the input fields are defined primitives surrounding the insertion point, the reference index. If you found another symbol \"$\", the text after it considered the description field:\n\nthe contents of the text box will be displayed in the list of object properties.\n\nTo limit the size of the input field or eliminate overlapping fields in the dialog, you can use the service line.\n\nTo create a stamp based on an existing base in the sample, the sample to be inserted into the drawing by setting in the dialog box \"Stamp\" mode \"Display field names\" . After insertion into the drawing die can be used as the layout of the new stamp.\n\nStandard fields stamps have a description in Russian (GOST), English (ISO) or German (DIN) language, the values of the fields available in the list of object properties.\n\nIn the pattern of the stamp can be used table nanoCAD Mechanica23. Included in the stamp table when you insert a drawing can be edited as regular tables nanoCAD Mechanica23 (except that the die table can not be modified in the editing mode screen).\n\nConverting from previous versions - In file %ProgramData%\\Nanosoft\n\nanoCAD Mechanica23\\DataRO\\ru-RU\\settings.xml defined fields for name mapping formats of old and new versions. If an entity applies the custom stamps of previous versions, the names of the fields, you can add them into the appropriate section of this file.\n\nTables - Format allows you to use tables as stamps. This preserves virtually all the functionality built-in table.\n\nUniversal marker - The values of any fields format can be used in a universal marker.\n\nDimensions - When you create within the format size, the size takes out set in the title block of the format.\n\nLegend roughness - The format may be associated with the designation of a roughness surfaces unspecified. Icon roughness is automatically transferred to the upper right corner of the format.\n\nProperty document - The value of the standard field format is synchronized with the attributes of the file in which it was created.\n\nTechnical conditions - Format calculates the coordinates of the columns to accommodate the technical requirements.\n\nAttribute documents TechnologiCS - Exchange values between the fields and the format of the document attributes.

In full table editor from the menu Edit invoke the command Form Editor.\n\n2. Create a form with controls and bind each control to a field (variable). More information about the forms, see Form Editor .\n\n3. Close the form editor and save the form.\n\n4. To set the variable, call the command form.\n\n5. Open your form. Enter the desired values. Click OK.\n\n6. Linking table cells with custom variables by using formulas.\n\nCell value will be associated with the variable.\n\nVariables can also be used in complex formulations.\n\nReports are necessary in order to organize the data of objects in the drawing.\n\nTo create a report in the table editor, call the command from \"Main menu - Section - Insert Report section\". The command will create a subsection \"Report template\".\n\nAdditional subsections are added using the \"Report template\" menu: \"Report title\", \"Report Summary\".\n\nHeader and footer sections are added from \"Main menu - Section\".\n\nThe report template defines the content and appearance of the report; it can consist of one or several lines. A separate copy of the report lines is created for each object. Formulas in the report are calculated using the properties of the selection objects.\n\nThe following commands are available in the \"Report template\" menu (click on the subsection name):\n\n· \"Object filter...\" - opens the \"Quick Selection\" dialog for forming a selection of drawing objects. The command is duplicated by the \"Select source objects\" button on the right in the \"Report template\" section.\n\n· \"Merging and Grouping...\" - opens the \"Row grouping and merging\" dialog in which the parameters of grouping and merging table cells are configured. The command is duplicated by the \"Group and merge\" button on the right in the \"Report template\" section.\n\n· \"Freeze report\" - the switch controls the report refresh mode. If the checkbox is selected, the update is performed manually, and the \"Update report\" command becomes available.\n\n· \"Update report\" - refreshes the values of report objects, the command is available in manual refresh mode.\n\n· \"Report header\" - adds a \"Report Title\" subsection to the beginning of the report, displayed at the beginning of each part of the table.\n\n· \"Append Data section\" - adds a data section below the report. If the section already exists, an additional line is appended.\n\n· \"Append Report section\" - adds a new report below the current one.\n\n· \"Remove Report\" - deletes the report with all associated subsections.\n\n· \"Rebuild\" - completely rebuilds the report based on the report template. Data entered manually in the \"Report\" section will be overwritten.\n\n· \"Convert to Data section\" - the command converts sections of the report to data. Blank lines are not converted. Calling the command opens the \"Conversion options\" dialog.\n\n· \"Report footer\" - Adds the \"Report Summary\" subsection to the end of the report, displayed after each part of the table.\n\nAll related subsections of the report are visually combined with brackets.\n\nThe \"Report\" displays the values of the template variables.\n\nThe report contains cells (with a lilac background) containing object data, marked with a special color. Selecting cells highlights the corresponding objects in the drawing.\n\nWhen editing such cells, the changes will be applied to the very object to which they refer. For instance:\n\n1. Take a Bolt GOST 7795-70 with a length of 50 mm and place a leader on it.\n\n4. Enter the new length, for example 120. Close the table editor.\n\n5. The length of the bolt in the drawing has changed.\n\nThe following commands are available in the \"Report Title\" menu (click on the subsection name):\n\nThe following commands are available in the \"Report Summary\" menu (click on the subsection name):\n\nIn the context menu of the \"Report Summary\" cells, there are the following additional commands: \"Sum\", \"Average\", \"Minimum\", \"Maximum\", \"Count\".\n\nThe commands insert into the selected cell corresponding to the name of the expression. The action is applied to a fragment of a column within one section.\n\n1. Call up the \"Quick Selection\" dialog box. Use the \"Filter Objects...\" command of the \"Report Template\" menu or the \"Select Source Objects\" button on the right in the \"Report Template\" section.\n\n2. Use the \"Quick Selection\" dialog to filter the objects and click the \"OK\" button. The selected objects will be associated with the report.\n\n3. Select a cell in the \"Report Template\" section. In the context menu of the cell, the parameters of the related objects will be available for insertion.\n\n5. Select an option from the context menu. The \"Report\" subsection will be automatically created. The number of lines in the \"Report\" subsection corresponds to the product of the number of related objects and the number of template lines.\n\nThe report template can consist of several lines. To add rows in the context menu of the \"Report Template\" row, use the \"Add Row\" or \"Insert Row\" commands.\n\nRows in a report template can be combined. Changes will be displayed in the \"Report\" section. Let's consider a join using the example table below:\n\n· Select cell A1:A2 and select the \"Group\" command from the context menu. The selected cells will be grouped.\n\n· In the \"Report template\" menu (click on the subsection name), select the \"Rebuild\" command. The table will look like this:\n\n6. Fill in all the required cells of the \"Report Template\".\n\n7. The sample is formed. Close the table editor. Changing the parameters of objects in the drawing will change the values in the report.\n\nIn the Grouping and merging dialog you can specify settings for grouping and merging table cells. Grouping and merging are only applied to cells in the report template.\n\nStudy the example for how to merge cells.\n\n1. In the Grouping and merging dialog box select Append rule and select Merge.\n\n2. Select the column name for the cells you want to merge. Selection is made by double clicking on the column name or by dragging it into the Select field.\n\nThe columns are processed according to the rules of the grouping remplate.\n\n3. If you want to sort, select and don't sortand sorting, and select sort type.\n\n4. Click OK to check the result in the table editor. Cells having identical values in the D column will be merged.\n\n1. In the dialog boxgroupings and click Add Rule select Group.\n\n2. Select the name of the column whose cells you want to group. Choice is either by double-clicking on the column name, or by dragging it into the Select .\n\n3. If you want to sort, click on the link and sorting, and select the type of sort.\n\n4. Click OK to view the results in the table editor. Table rows that contain the same values ??in column C, will be grouped.\n\nThe Formula Editor (Expression Builder) allows you to set parameters, arithmetic expressions, and object property references for a selected table cell.\n\n· By clicking on the \"fx\" button in the formula bar;\n\nThe dialog box consists of the \"Expression Input Field\", \"Formula Templates\", \"List of Registered Functions\", \"Quick View Fields\" and the \"Attach object\" button.\n\nThe \"Attach Object\" button allows you to attach to objects.\n\nAt the top of the dialog there is an expression input field, with which you can manually enter any arithmetic expressions, as well as use reserved variables and object properties.\n\nWhen entering manually, a list of functions and variables containing the word being entered appears in the list of reserved functions; syntax is also checked. If the formula is incorrect, an error warning or hint will appear in the Quick View.\n\nIn the quick view field, by clicking the mouse on an expression, the text in the input field related to this expression is selected.\n\nWhen you click on the button in the \"Expression input field\", the entered expression is saved on the formula templates panel for quick recall. Pressing the button again removes the expression from the formula template.\n\nThe \"Reserved Functions List\" contains recently used expressions that are highlighted in yellow. When you click on the button, expressions are saved in the Formula Templates panel for quick recall. Expressions that are in the Formula Template Bar in the Reserved Functions list will be marked with an asterisk. Pressing the button again removes the expression from the formula template.\n\nWhen you hover the cursor over the button of the saved template, a tooltip will appear with the contents of this template.\n\nIn order to insert an expression from the \"Formula template\", place the cursor in the required position, press the button with the template.\n\nTo delete an expression template, click the triangle button and uncheck the required template in the list that appears.\n\nIn the formula, you can use any cell values of the properties of another object. If using automatic recalculation of the table, the formula object is automatically recalculated. Each cell can attach one or more objects. Objects are named Object1, Object2, and Object3, … sequentially numbered in the table. If the object is not used in a formula, it will detach from the table at the next calculation, and the object references are renumbered.\n\nBinding properties for drawing objects to a single cell then use the expression or the keys Shift+F2. Available in the context menu of the selected cell.\n\nAfter selecting the command window opens the Expression Builder.\n\nSelect the object whose data you want to send to the table (eg, Bolt M52). Now the list of expressions appears in the properties of the selected object. Double-clicking on the property (select Object.Name), adds it to the text in a cell. Click OK.\n\nAfter connection of the facility to the cell the cell color changes (it says that the formula in the cell) and it will display the calculated result, in this case the name of the object:\n\nCos, Sin, Tg - trigonometric functions, the argument given in degrees.\n\nAcos, Asin, Atg - inverse trigonometric functions, the result is given in degrees.\n\nSumm - returns the sum of the values of the variables in a grouped cells.\n\nSumm(Row) - returns the sum of the numbers of grouped rows..\n\nSumm(Standartnaya_detal.L) - returns the sum of the values ??of the L parameter object \"standard part\" in the grouped rows.\n\nFrm - convert a numeric value to a string formatted according to the settings of a table column.\n\nFrm(0.001230) returns a string 0,0012, if the column containing the cell is set to zero suppression and accuracy of 0,0000\n\nLogich_Uslovie - logical condition using logical comparisons (see above);\n\nEsli_istina - the return value when the logical condition;\n\nif(object == Marker_universalny; Marker_universalny.position; \"Undefined\") . If an object type, which is connected with the cell column has Marker_universalny value, the function returns the position value of the referenced object. Another type of object it returns a string Undefined .\n\nExist - Checks whether there is a constant: =IF(EXIST(Object.Name);Object.Name;0)\n\nMin/Max - returns the minimum / maximum value listed in parentheses\n\nCount - returns the number of objects (for grouped rows in the table).\n\nCount() - returns the number of objects associated with cells grouped rows.\n\nAvg - Calculates the arithmetic mean of the arguments. Takes an arbitrary number of arguments understand ranges. Empty arguments are ignored.\n\nOff - returns the value of the cell, given the relative index. The index is written in the format:\n\nOff(-1;2) - returns the value of cell in the table on one line above (-1) and two columns to the right (2) of the current\n\nCell - the cell returns the value specified absolute index.\n\nMerge (Cells,Expression) - brings together a range of Cells, if Expression is not equal to 0. Returns the value of Expression.\n\n=merge(A5:C5; \"Title\") – integrates cell A5 to C5, in the summary displays the text \"Title\".\n\nSetHeight() – reference line height. In brackets the height value.\n\nVal() - computes the value of the argument.\n\n=val(\"A\"+\"1\") - calculates the \"A1\", and then uses it as another expression (obtained by the value in cell A1). If the argument - not a string, then he comes back, ie =val(10+2) - the same thing =10+2.\n\n=val(\"summ(A\"+Str(off(0;-1))+\":D\"+Str(off(0;-1))+\")\") - the amount of cells from rows A to D, the number which is introduced into the cell to the left of the current one. In most cases you can do without val. The classic example, when without it - no way: in a custom form, enter the cell address, then to take the value out of it. Create a variable Addr, associate it with an input field on a form and in the table do so: = val (Addr) function allows recursion: = val (val (\"A\" + \"1\")) - to take the value of the cell whose address is recorded in cell A1. Nesting depth is limited to 64.\n\nGeometry(Object) - works as Implement object. Height embedded object shrinks to the line height. Object is taken from the report, or attached to the cell.\n\nSUMM(Section(-1)) - Sum of cells in the current column of the section next to the current.\n\nCOUNT(Section(A3)) - The number of rows in the section containing the cell A3.\n\nRow - for each cell in the column it returns the number of rows (rows are numbered starting with 1, excluding the header lines).\n\nCol - for all cells in a column returns the column number of the table (column \"A\" is number 1).\n\nObject - returns the type of the object, which is associated with the cell line.\n\nTitle - the name of the table.\n\nThe \"Split the table by pages\" tool is similar to the \"Division by page\" editor tool, but the result is not a split single table, but several separate tables.\n\n2. In the places where the break will be, set the break with the command \"Start new page\".\n\n5. From the context menu, select the \"Split table by pages\" command.\n\n6. The table will be split into separate tables. The separation will occur at the places of the established breaks.\n\nDimension styles allow you to control the appearance of dimensions and quickly format them.\n\nThe inscription \"Current style: ...\" - information about the current dimension style, which is used when applying dimensions.\n\n\"Styles\" list - a list of all dimension styles in the document.\n\nThe \"Preview of: ...\" window is a graphical representation of the style selected in the \"Styles\" list.\n\n· Modify... – change the parameters of the style selected in the list.

The \"Hole chart\" dialog opens.\n\n5. In the \"Hole chart\" dialog, specify the name and type (dekatrov or polar) of the coordinate system, add (or delete), if necessary, holes.\n\n6. Insert into the drawing the necessary tables: List of coordinates, Table of holes, Table of values.\n\n7. Click \"OK.\" Tables will be built. Holes will be associated with tables and coordinate system.\n\nThe \"Hole chart\" dialog is called for editing by double-clicking on the coordinate system.\n\n· List of coordinates - an automatically updated table is formed with the coordinates of each hole.\n\n· Hole table - a table is formed, grouped by hole diameter. Each group of identical holes is assigned a letter.\n\n· Button Number holes - the command automatically assigns consecutive numbers or letters to the holes (according to the setting for Hole Designation).\n\n· Button Add holes - this command allows you to add holes to the report.\n\n· Button Remove holes - this command allows you to remove holes from the report.\n\n· Field \"Name\" - the name of the coordinate system. It is added to the hole designation as a prefix.\n\nThe handles of the report tables are similar to the handles of ordinary tables.\n\n3. Handle move the designation of the coordinate system.\n\nA distinctive feature of nanoCAD Mechanica 23 is the possibility of linking the designation of textual information on the drawing with the text in the technical requirements.\n\nWhen writing paragraphs of technical requirements (hereinafter TC), you can make reference within the proposal of the paragraph of technical requirements to any position or affixed view.\n\nThe textual information is the tolerances and dimensions, drawing zones, designations of types, cuts, sections, marking signs, marking of welded joints, position.\n\nA change in the value of the textual information (for example, a part position number) will result in an automatic change in the TC text. If this position has been deleted, a warning will appear about the need to check a particular item of requirements.\n\nThe relationship between the TC and the designation works in the opposite direction. Changing the order of the points of the requirements (their numbering) is automatically reflected in the designation on the drawing (for example, a marking mark, the designation of which contains the item number from the technical requirements).\n\n· Open file - the command opens the TC from a previously saved file.\n\n· Close without save - the command closes the TC editing dialog box without saving.\n\n· Open file - the command opens the TC from a previously saved file.\n\n· Fill in MSWord - the command opens a new document in MSWord and inserts the text TC.\n\n· Replace paragraph up - the command moves the TC item at which the cursor is located, higher up in the list.\n\n· Replace paragraph down - the command moves the TC item at which the cursor is located, down the list.\n\n· Decrease Indent - the command reduces the indent of selected items.\n\n· Line Spacing - the command opens the list for setting the line spacing. Adjust line spacing of selected items.\n\n· 1 - set 1 leading (unit for measuring line spacing). Line spacing is added after the TC item.\n\n· 1.5 - set 1.5 leading. Line spacing is added after the TC item.\n\n· 2 - set 2 leading. Line spacing is added after the TC item.\n\n· Set line spacing... - the command allows you to specify your own line spacing. Line spacing is added after the TC item.\n\n· Subscript - translates the selected portion of the text into a subscript.\n\n· Insert fraction - the command calls the \"Fraction\" dialog box in which the numerator and denominator are specified. The fraction is inserted into the text TC.\n\n· Insert tolerance - provides the ability to insert a tolerance. When called, the \"Tolerances\" dialog box opens.\n\n· Insert material - provides the ability to insert material. When called, opens the \"Material\" dialog.\n\n· Insert spec symbol - allows you to insert special characters in the text TC.\n\n· Numeration - the command allows you to select the design option for TC items.\n\n· Insert position - the command associates text fragments in the TC with a graphical representation of the positions in the drawing.\n\nTo insert a link in the TC editor, place the cursor on the insertion point of the associated symbol and click on the \"Insert position\" button, select a position in the drawing.\n\nRelated information is displayed in blue in the TC editor. When you click on a link, the application will display the associated graphical representation.\n\n· Insert view/cuts - the command associates text fragments in TC with a graphical representation of views, sections and sections in the drawing.\n\nTo insert a link in the TC editor, place the cursor on the insertion point of the associated symbol and click on the \"Insert view / cuts\" button, select the view, section or section.\n\nRelated information is displayed in blue in the TC editor. When you click on a link, the application will display the associated graphical representation.\n\n· Ruler. The ruler is used to position the lines relative to the entire TC document. Sliders are used to position the lines.\n\n1. The bottom slider adjusts the indentation of all paragraph lines except the first line.\n\n2. The top slider adjusts the indent of the first paragraph line.\n\n3. The angle slider adjusts the text indent from the numbered list marker.\n\nThe context menu uses standard commands for text fields.\n\nTo set the TC text parameters (font height and slope, indent from the title block, etc.) open the dialog box \"Settings\".\n\nWorking with the technical description editor is similar to working with the TC editor. The main difference is that the typed text can be placed anywhere in the drawing.\n\n· Open file - the command opens the TP from a previously saved file.\n\n· Close without save - the command closes the TP editing dialog box without saving.\n\n· Open file - the command opens the TP from a previously saved file.\n\n· Fill in MSWord - the command opens a new document in MSWord and inserts the text TP.\n\n· Replace paragraph up - the command moves the TP item at which the cursor is located, higher up in the list.\n\n· Replace paragraph down - the command moves the TP item at which the cursor is located, down the list.\n\n· Decrease Indent - the command reduces the indent of selected items.\n\n· Line Spacing - the command opens the list for setting the line spacing. Adjust line spacing of selected items.\n\n· 1 - set 1 leading (unit for measuring line spacing). Line spacing is added after the TP item.\n\n· 1.5 - set 1.5 leading.

Technical drawings for CNC cut in flat sheet metal stock prior to forming.\n\n \n\n I started to use NanoCad the other day after researching 3d, failing to get to grips with freecad and fusion. It appeared to be closer in use to QCAD.\n\n \n\n Currently playing with the free version while I evaluate, I'm struggling to join an entity together after finalising the shape I need, created from single lines/arcs etc.\n\n \n\n In QCAD, it's a simple step, right click on any line etc in the drawing and click the 'auto creat polyline' icon, it's that simple.\n\n \n\n Similar with extend or trim, click the item you wish to extend, specify length and click, trim just removes the item to the nearest other point/s.\n\n \n\n Is this a limit with the free version or does this not change and remain as painful in the full versions? \n\n \n\n I have yet to succesfully close a shape into a polyline in NanoC. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n To join lines and arcs into a polyline use the following commands.\n\n \n\n You: PEDIT <Space> Response: PE,PEDIT - Edit Polylines / Select polyline or [?/Multiple/]: You: m <Space> Response: Select objects [?/End/] You: <Draw a window to select the objects you want to join> <Space> Response: 6 found, 6 total / Convert Lines and Arcs to polylines?

To break them apart again use Explode. You can do other things at the Join prompt like close the polyline, make the segments straight or curved.\n\n \n\n Trim and Extend also work nicely from the command line. Enter TRIM and hit <Space> twice at the following prompt. This sets every object in the drawing as an object you can trim against. Then just go round the drawing clicking anything you don't want. It trims off any line segments that are sticking out beyond an intersection. Presing <Shift> switches to Extend mode so you can extend lines to the next intersection. If you make a mistake there is an undo option.\n\n \n\n Hope this helps. \n\n Hi jons. I hope I can help. I'm a fairly new user of nanoCAD. A couple of hints. The command line is your friend. Search for a few tutorials on how to do things in the AutoCAD command line. For most basic drawing commands nanoCAD is similar at the command level.To join lines and arcs into a polyline use the following commands.The separate lines are converted to a polyline.

For something that right clicking on one part of the line achieves in QCAD. I have same problem with parrelel line at set distance, infact all the operations in QCAD can be done quickly and efficiently with the mouse, I have the command bar turned off.\n\n \n\n I have to say though other than polyline/join/trim, I did manage to pick up the other functions within the software, command bar or mouse pretty well. Of several packages I've tried it has more potential, it's just how much slower it is to draw even the basic shapes we create. \n\n Thanks for this, surely if the drawing contains many other items within the polyline I wish to create then 'select all' those other items will be included?Secondly it confirms exactly as I stated, what a palavour!

I agree that using the command line can get a bit fiddly. But in the above example for a polyline, you are mostly accepting the defaults and clicking the elements you want to join. If there are nearby objects that are not part of the polyline, you just need to be a bit more careful about selecting the ones you want. I found that practising with the command line taught me how to draft things very quickly and accurately. It wasn't a problem that some of the more advanced UI features were unavailable.\n\n \n\n Incidentally, why migrate to nanoCAD if you are happy with QCAD? And do you really need to convert things to polylines? Can't you just leave them as lines?\n\n \n\n For your parallel lines example, there are several quick ways to do it. eg. Draw a construction line perpendicular to the first line. Then COPY, setting the basepoint at the intersection and OSNAP as NEAREST. Use Direct Distance Entry to input the required separation distance. Or just use the OFFSET command."

I'll also be searching for this problem in the meantime, but its a little tough to figure out how to phrase it so I'll also post it.I'm using a silhouette cutter (with their software silhouette studio) to make cutouts of designs. When I take the dxf I've made and import it into the silhouette studio, the lines come in curved.I had this same issue with NanoCAD before and I managed to fix it through joining lines to make a single polyline. Unfortunately, QCAD isn't letting me do so.Any thoughts? File included. Here's a pic of what I'm talking about as well."

        "document": "I am struggling to get Polyline to work correctly. I have so far been successful in drawing a basic wineglass shape but I am having difficulty in more complex shapes.\n\nI am attempting to draw a simple tyre profile and rotate it around an axis with the Revolve command.\n\nI know I must draw Polylines and I am aware of changing a Line into a Polyline with PEDIT. I am also comfortable changing an ARC into a Polyline with PEDIT. My Issues start when I cannot join all of my Polylines to use the REGION command.\n\nI begin by using Polyline to draw the basic U shaped tyre profile with square corners. I then use FILLET to round the Corners and PEDIT to change these curves into Polylines. For completeness I then select the entire drawing and EXPLODE it then again select the entire drawing and use the JOIN command. This gives be a basic tyre profile with round corners that is all joined up and the REGION command recognises it as an enclosed area. So far so good - now comes the tricky bit.\n\nI now want to modify this basic shape and put treads on the tyre. I have used many different methods but all end up the same way. The easiest way to draw the treads is with a combination of LINES and the OFFSET and TRIM command then convert them to Polylines with PEDIT and JOIN them but I cannot make it work. Every time I try I get two (or more) Polylines that WILL NOT JOIN and so will not create a REGION.\n\nThe time consuming way to do this is to use the Polyline Command and hand enter co-ordinates and build the Square Wave shape I want. This again creates a Polyline but it WILL NOT JOIN and so will not create a REGION.\n\nWould someone please be kind enough to show me how I should be doing this? MyCADsite is great but it teaches basic commands and gives practice shapes but only an video explanation of the Lesson - which I am successful at doing.\n\nWhat I want to know is how to draw this shape so that I can use the REVOLVE command to create a Tyre.\n\nA simple inverted U shape that is 4 units high and 7 units wide with legs and top that is 0.6 units thick, giving an internal height of 3.404 units by 5.8 units. Internal and external corners are then filleted with 0.5 unit radius curves.\n\nThe central tread is 0.25 units deep and 0.125 units wide. There are three identical treads on each side of the centre that are each 0.875 units apart.\n\nI can draw this shape in 2D no sweat, my problem is turning it into a Polyline shape that encloses an area so that I can then REVOLVE it around a central axis.\n\nI am sure that what I am doing is very simple but I just cannot see where I am going wrong. For reference this is Lesson 3-8 Extra Practice Exercise on MyCADSite.com"
