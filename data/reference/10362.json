        "document": "If you’re having networking or internet issues, it might be time to change your DNS server settings. Or perhaps you just want to switch to a faster DNS provider that is more reliable and secure? Regardless of the reason, changing your DNS settings on Windows 10 and Windows 11 is simple, with several different methods to get the job done.\n\nDNS is important because it allows people to use domain names like www.pdq.com and network resource names like FILE-SERVER01 instead of IP addresses, which are more difficult to remember. When a user tries to navigate to a website or network resource using a name, DNS is queried and returns the corresponding IP address that can then be used to navigate to the correct destination. This process happens seamlessly and in the background, which is my favorite way for processes to happen.\n\nMost internet-connected devices automatically use the DNS servers designated by their internet service providers (ISP). For example, if your ISP is Comcast, it automatically directs you to its DNS servers at the IP addresses 75.75.75.75 and 75.75.76.76. However, switching your settings to a faster DNS server could boost your web browsing performance. Consider using a free Windows utility, like DNS Benchmark, to find the best-performing DNS servers for you.\n\nConfiguring your DNS server settings with Control Panel is quick, easy, and probably the oldest method on this list. Best of all, this approach works on both Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices. While Microsoft seems determined replace Control Panel with the new Settings app, they’ll have to pry it out of my cold, dead hands.\n\nMicrosoft is transitioning all the settings away from Control Panel and into the Settings app. In Windows 10, the Settings app contains many — but not all — of the configuration options found in Control Panel. As a result, this method uses a combination of both the Settings app and the Control Panel.\n\nAs you can see, our DNSServer was changed from 192.168.60.30 to Google’s DNS servers, 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4. Now that you know how to change your DNS server using PowerShell, check out The PowerShell Podcast to discover all the other awesome things you can do with PowerShell.\n\nSysadmins have a saying. It’s not DNS. There’s no way it’s DNS. It was DNS. Hopefully this guide helps reduce your DNS woes so you can have a smoother, faster, and more secure online experience. Just keep in mind that a better DNS server isn’t going to stop you from posting an embarrassing picture on social media. That one’s on you."

        "document": "The DNS, or Domain Name System, acts as a phone book for the internet to convert between IP address and domain name. By default, your Windows computer uses whatever DNS server is set up by your internet provider. But you don't have to stick with that server.\n\nWhy would you want to change it? Certain third-party DNS services can provide tighter security and faster performance than the one from your ISP.\n\nAlso: 5 ways to save your Windows 10 PC in 2025 - and most are free\n\nSuch services include Google DNS, Cloudflare, OpenDNS, and Comodo SecureDNS. Here's how to change your PC's DNS settings to use an alternate provider.\n\nFirst, let's look at how to switch the DNS server settings. Then we'll check out some of the third-party DNS providers. Note: The steps to change the DNS server are different for Windows 10 and Windows 11. We'll cover Windows 10 first.\n\nHow to change the DNS settings in Windows 10\n\nAlso: The best Windows laptops you can buy: Expert tested\n\nHow to change the DNS settings in Windows 11\n\nShould you change the IPv6 address?\n\nSince the world has already run out of IP version 4 addresses, we've been transitioning to IP version 6, which provides a much greater range of usable addresses. So does that mean you should also change the DNS servers for IPv6? Not necessarily. Most ISPs either don't support IPv6 or are still in the testing phase.\n\nYou can check if your internet provider has jumped on board the version 6 bandwagon. Browse to the Test-IPv6 website using your current connection. The results will tell you whether your ISP supports the newer protocol. If so, most third-party services do provide IPv6 addresses.\n\nNow that you know the process for changing your DNS server settings, let's look at a few third-party services worth trying.\n\nGoogle Public DNS is one of the most popular third-party DNS providers, handling name and IP address resolution faster than many other services. Google's DNS server is designed to protect you against spoofing attacks that try to redirect you to malicious sites. The company's website for its DNS service shares details about its performance and security features and offers an issue tracker and a user forum.\n\nAlso: Hate Windows 11? Here's how to make it work more like Windows 10\n\nCloudflare DNS is another alternative DNS provider that aims to be faster than competing services. Cloudflare also vows that it won't log your IP address, a process used by many ISPs that gives them the ability to record the sites you visit.\n\nOwned and operated by Cisco, OpenDNS offers two free packages for consumers. On the free side, the basic package is OpenDNS Home, while the OpenDNS Family Shield plan can block adult content for those who have children at home.\n\nComing from a reliable cybersecurity company, Comodo SecureDNS is worth considering if you're concerned about your online security. The company's DNS service tries to protect you from phishing attacks and malware. SecureDNS also keeps a real-time list of malicious websites and warns you if you attempt to access one of them.\n\nAlso: This new Windows feature makes password-hacking attacks much harder\n\nFinally, you can easily change the DNS settings for all the computers and other devices in your home by switching them directly on your router. To do this, sign into your router's firmware. Look for a setting for Internet or network setup and find the section for DNS addresses.\n\nThe existing option is likely set to get the addresses from your ISP. Change that to manually assign the addresses and then type the preferred and alternate addresses from the service of your choice. When done, apply the new settings."

        "document": "As part of your internet plan, the Internet Service Provider (ISP) also provides the local network with the necessary settings, including the Domain Name System (DNS) addresses, which allows you to access your favorite websites and online services and download files.\n\nThe only caveat is that the ISP's DNS servers are usually not very private, are slower than other services, and are sometimes unreliable. However, you can always use different resolvers from third-party companies to improve your internet experience on Windows 10.\n\nA Domain Name System is an internet service (usually at no cost to you) that allows you to type a friendly domain name in the web browser's address bar to load a website. And without it, it'd be a nightmare to surf the web.\n\nThe issue is that every device requires an IP address (for example, 104.18.189.55) to communicate with other devices. However, these addresses are not easy for humans to remember, and DNS servers are the ones that provide the mechanism to translate friendly domain names (for example, WindowsCentral.com) into an IP address that computers can understand.\n\nAlthough you can type \"https://windowscentral.com\" to get to this website, in the background, the browser first sends a request to the DNS servers to resolve the IP address from the website name. Only when the address is found does the browser connect to the site and download the page's contents.\n\nUsually, you won't notice this process because it's automatic, and everything happens quickly (in milliseconds). However, if your resolvers are unreliable, they slow down your internet, or you want to use faster and more private servers, Windows 10 allows you to change these settings using Control Panel, Command Prompt, and Settings app.\n\nIn this how-to guide, I'll walk you through the steps to change the DNS settings on Windows 10.\n\nHow to change DNS settings using Control Panel on Windows 11\n\nTo change the DNS settings with Control Panel, use these steps:\n• Click the \"Change adapter settings\" option in the left pane.\n• Right-click the active network interface and select the Properties option.\n• Quick tip: You'll know which adapter is connected to the network because it won't have a \"Disabled\" or \"Network cable unplugged\" label.\n• Select the \"Use the following DNS server addresses\" option.\n• Quick note: When you select the option to specify the DNS settings manually, the computer will continue to receive the TCP/IP address from the DHCP server (router).\n• Confirm the primary DNS address under the \"Preferred DNS server\" section. If you want to use Cloudflare, Google Public DNS, or Cisco OpenDNS, you can use these settings:\n• Confirm the secondary DNS address the system will use if the primary is not reachable under the \"Alternate DNS server\" section. You can use one of the secondary addresses from these companies:\n• Quick tip: In addition to adding more addresses, you can edit and remove resolvers, and you have an option on the side to change their priority.\n\nOnce you complete the steps, the computer will immediately start using the specified DNS settings.\n\nHow to change DNS settings using Settings on Windows 10\n\nTo change the DNS addresses through the Settings app, use these steps:\n• Select the connection that connects Windows 10 to the network.\n• Click the Edit button under the \"IP settings\" section\n• Use the \"Edit IP settings\" drop-down menu and select the Manual option.\n• Confirm the primary DNS address under the \"Preferred DNS server\" section. To use Cloudflare, Google Public DNS, or Cisco OpenDNS, use these settings:\n• Confirm the secondary DNS address under the \"Alternate DNS server\" section. You can use one of the secondary addresses from these companies:\n\nAfter you complete the steps, you should now be able to connect to the internet using the new resolvers. The restart may be necessary to regain an IP address configuration for the device.\n\nAlthough the Settings app should be the recommended option to change the DNS settings on your computer, I\"m not listing this option first because it can be confusing for some people.\n\nHow to change DNS settings using Command Prompt on Windows 10\n\nAlternatively, it's also possible to change the DNS configuration using Command Prompt on Windows 10.\n\nTo use Command Prompt to change the computer's DNS settings, use these steps:\n• Search for Command Prompt, right-click the top result, and select the Run as administrator option.\n• Type the following command to launch the tool to change the networking settings and press Enter: netsh\n• Type the following command to identify the names of the network adapters and press Enter: interface show interface\n• Type the following command to set the primary DNS IP address and press Enter: interface ip set dns name=\"ADAPTER-NAME\" source=\"static\" address=\"X.X.X.X\"\n\nIn the command, change \"ADAPTER-NAME\" with the name of the network adapter you identified in step 4, and change \"X.X.X.X\" with the IP address you want to use. To use Cloudflare, Google Public DNS, or Cisco OpenDNS, you can use these settings:\n\nThis example sets the primary DNS address to 1.1.1.1: interface ip set dns name=\"Ethernet1\" source=\"static\" address=\"1.1.1.1\"\n• Type the following command to add an alternative DNS IP address and press Enter: interface ip add dns name=\"ADAPTER-NAME\" addr=\"X.X.X.X\" index=2\n\nIn the command, change \"ADAPTER-NAME\" with the name of the network adapter you queried in step 4, and change \"X.X.X.X\" with the secondary address. This example sets the secondary DNS address to 1.0.0.1: interface ip add dns name=\"Ethernet1\" addr=\"1.0.0.1\" index=2\n• Quick tip: You can repeat the above steps to add more addresses if necessary. However, in the command, you must increase the number of the index option by \"1.\" For instance, interface ip add dns name=\"Ethernet1\" addr=\"8.8.8.8\" index=3\n\nOnce you complete the steps, Windows 10 will start using the new DNS server addresses to resolve domain names to numeric addresses that your device can understand.\n\nFor more helpful articles, coverage, and answers to common questions about Windows 10 and Windows 11, visit the following resources:\n• Windows 11 on Windows Central — All you need to know\n• Windows 10 on Windows Central — All you need to know"

        "document": "DNS is an essential protocol for Internet communication. However, the security of this critical protocol might be significantly enhanced. Encryption is absent, and although authentication systems are available, they face criticism and have not gained significant use. The DNSCrypt protocol was explicitly developed to enhance DNS security. DNSCrypt is a protocol that encrypts, authenticates, and optionally anonymizes communications between a DNS client and a DNS resolver. It is an open standard with free and open-source reference implementations, and it is not affiliated with any firm or organization. DNSCrypt version 2 was defined and executed in 2013 and is perhaps the most widely used encrypted DNS protocol to date.\n\nDNSCrypt is helpful in mitigating DNS spoofing attacks. It employs cryptographic signatures to authenticate that replies are sourced from the designated DNS resolver and remain unaltered.\n\nIn this tutorial, we examine the installation and configuration of the DNSCrypt-proxy plugin on OPNsense firewall. Furthermore, we give the list of public DNScrypt servers and explain the features of DNScrypt service.\n\nYou can easily install DNSCrypt-proxy plugin by following the next steps.\n• Type in the search field to find the DNSCrypt-proxy plugin.\n• Click on the icon next to to install the plugin. Then you will be redirected to the Update menu tab.\n• Click on the Plugins tab. You should see that plugin is installed.\n\nAfter reloading the page by clicking on the OPNsense logo at the top left, you should see DNSCrypt-Proxy menu under Services.\n\nYou may enable and configure DNSCrypt-proxy on OPNsense by navigating to the Services > DNSCrypt-proxy > Configuration. The daemon searches for a list of public DNS servers from this location, , when it is initiated:\n\nDepending on the parameters below, the list can be shortened to your preference, such as disabling logging or limiting it to IPv4. DNS queries will be executed by the two servers that complete them most quickly. The following options are available on DNSCrypt-proxy configuration page.\n• Enable DNSCrypt-Proxy: You may click on the checkbox to activate DNSCrypt-Proxy service.\n• Listen Address: You may configure the addresses and ports for listening. The default settings are localhost and port . To allow listening on port 53, you must enable Allow Privileged Ports, particularly when the system is intended to function as a resolver.\n• Allow Privileged Ports: This option allows the service to listen on ports below , like .\n• Max Client Connections: You may set the maximum number of simultaneous client connections to accept.\n• Use IPv4 Servers: You may let DNSCrypt-Proxy use IPv4 enabled servers.\n• Use IPv6 Servers: You may let DNSCrypt-Proxy use IPv6 enabled servers.\n• Use DNSCrypt Servers: You may let DNSCrypt-Proxy use servers with DNSCrypt protocol enabled servers.\n• Use DNS-over-HTTPS Servers: You may let DNSCrypt-Proxy use servers with DNSCrypt-over-HTTPS protocol enabled servers.\n• Require DNSSEC: You may allow only DNS resolvers with DNSSEC enabled.\n• Require NoLog: You may allow only DNS resolvers with disabled-logging.\n• Require NoFilter: You may allow only DNS resolvers without filtering.\n• Force TCP: You may consistently use TCP for connections to upstream servers. This is beneficial if you need to route all traffic over Tor; otherwise, it should remain disabled.\n• Proxy: You may use this option to route all TCP connections to a local Tor node. The format has to be like `127.0.0.1:9050.\n• Timeout: You may specify how long a DNS query will wait for a response in milliseconds; the default is .\n• Keepalive: You may specify keepalive for HTTP (HTTPS, HTTP/2) queries in seconds; the default is .\n• Cert Refresh Delay: You may specify the delay in minutes after which certificates are reloaded; the default is .\n• Ephemeral Keys: You may generate a distinct key for each DNS query. This may enhance privacy but may considerably affect CPU use.\n• TLS Disable Session Tickets: You may disable TLS session tickets. This enhances privacy but also increases latency.\n• Fallback Resolver: This is a standard, non-encrypted DNS resolver intended just for one-time requests to get the initial list of resolvers, and only if the system's DNS configuration fails. The default value is which corresponds to the Quad9 DNS service. You may change it to to use Cloudflare.\n• Block IPv6: You may check this option if you don’t use IPv6.\n• **Cache: You may enable a DNS cache to reduce latency and outgoing traffic.\n• Cache Size: You may specify the cache size.\n• Cache Min TTL: You may specify the minimum TTL for cached entries.\n• Cache Max TTL: You may specify the maximum TTL for cached entries.\n• Cache Negative Min TTL: You may specify the minimum TTL for negatively cached entries.\n• Cache Negative Max TTL: You may specify the maximum TTL for negatively cached entries.\n• Server List: You may set a list of known servers. You can also put your manually added servers here. You may find a list of available servers in the following section. If this options is left blank, DNS servers are selected randomly.\n• Disabled Servers List: You may exclude servers from automatic selection by adding any specific server names here if you do not want to use them for any reason.\n• Relay List: You may set a list of relays that will be used for relaying to all configured servers.\n\nDNSCrypt-proxy plugin allows you to add specific public DNSCrypt servers as you want. To define public DNSCrypt servers that you want to use on your OPNsense, you may follow the next steps.\n• First, you need to find the SDNS stamp information for the DNS server that you will add. For this purpose, you may visit .\n• Click on the DNS server, such as which may be used for removing ads and protecting your computer from malware.\n• Navigate to the Services > DNSCrypt-proxy > Configuration on OPNsense web UI.\n• Click on the Add button with the icon at the bottom right of the page.\n• Type the Name for the DNS resolver, such as .\n• Paste the SDNS Stamp that you copied in step 3 without prefix.\n• You may add as many DNS servers as you want.\n• Click Save. This will automatically add the new server settings, and it will be listed on the Servers page.\n• You can easily edit the DNS server setting by clicking on Edit button with a pen icon at the end of the row.\n• You may remove the DNS server setting by clicking on Delete button with a trash icon at the end of the row.\n\nBlocklists are names or patterns that will cause a query to immediately receive a REFUSED response. Rather than creating blocklists from scratch, you may use existing ones. You may easily add blocklists by following the next steps.\n• Navigate to the Services > DNSCrypt-proxy > Configuration on OPNsense web UI.\n• Click Enable DNSBL and RPZ checkbox to activate the use of DNS Blocklists for ADs, Malware, or both.\n• Select the predefined external DNSBL blocklist from the Type of DNSBL drop-down list. You may select as many DNSBL types as you want. When any DNSBL type is used, the material will be retrieved straight from its original source.\n\nThe following DNSBL types are available for DNSCrypt-proxy on OPNsense platform.\n\nWhitelist is a name or pattern that will cause a query to bypass blocklists. It will never be blocked. Whitelists might be advantageous when using a third-party blocklist to ensure certain domains remain consistently accessible. They may be beneficial if you want to blocklist a domain, like , but permit its subdomain, like .\n\nYou may easily add whitelists by following the next steps.\n• Navigate to the Services > DNSCrypt-proxy > Configuration on OPNsense web UI.\n• Click on the Add button with the icon at the bottom right of the page.\n• Set the domain, IP or expression to whitelist, e.g. or in Name field.\n• Click Save to save the whitelist. This will automatically add the whitelist settings, and it will be listed on the Whitelists page.\n• You can easily edit the whitelist setting by clicking on Edit button with a pen icon at the end of the row.\n• You may remove the whitelist setting by clicking on Delete button with a trash icon at the end of the row.\n\nYou may easily integrate Unbound DNS server with DNSCrypt-proxy on an OPNsense firewall. To enable Unbound DNS to send all DNS queries to the DNSCrypt-proxy, you may follow the next steps.\n• Click on the Add button with the icon at the bottom right of the Custom Forwarding pane.\n• Leave the Domain field empty to redirect all inquiries to the DNScrypt-proxy service.\n• Specify the DNSCrypt-proxy service listen port in the Server Port option, such as .\n• You may enter a Description for your reference, like .\n\nThe DNSCrypt-Proxy may function as a comprehensive independent DNS alternative to Unbound or Dnsmasq. This configuration eliminates the need for a forwarder solution to encrypt DNS queries or use DNSBL. To run DNSCrypt-Proxy as a standalone DNS server you may need to complete the following steps.\n• Disable Unbound DNS by navigating to Services > Unbound DNS > General and then deselecting Enable Unbound option.\n• Disable Dnsmasq by navigating to Services > Dnsmasq DNS > Settings and then deselecting Enable Dnsmasq option.\n• Set the Listen Address to to enable the service to be recognized as standalone by the main system.\n\nYou may now proceed with your setup tasks, such as selecting servers, establishing a privacy policy, or configuring caching. Cloaking (overrides) or DNSBL may be used without any circumventions.\n\nYou may easily restart the DNSCrypt-Proxy service for your networks on the OPNsense firewall by following the next steps.\n• Navigate to the Services > DNSCrypt-Proxy > General on your OPNsense web UI.\n• Click on the Restart button at the top right of the page.\n\nYou may easily start or stop DNSCrypt-Proxy service for your networks on the OPNsense firewall by following the next steps.\n• Navigate to the Services > DNSCrypt-Proxy > Configuration on your OPNsense web UI.\n• Click on the Stop button at the top right of the page. This will immediately stop the service.\n• Click on the Start button at the top right of the page to start the DNSCrypt-Proxy service. This will immediately start the server. You may view or start/stop/restart DNSCrypt-Proxy services by navigating to the System > Diagnostics > Services page on OPNsense web UI.\n\nAfter installing DNScrypt-proxy plugin on OPNsense firewall, you may verify your configuration in several ways explained below.\n\nAfter enabling DNSCrypt-proxy server and enable query logging option on your OPNsense, you should see both rejected and passed DNS queries on your network on the Log/Queries page by navigating to the Services > DNSCrypt-proxy > Log/Queries. A sample log file is given below.\n\nYou may view the available DNS servers that your OPNsense firewall has already accessed and their response times on the Log/General page by navigating to the Services > DNSCrypt-proxy > Log/General.\n\nis a widely used website that can be used to determine the DNS resolvers that are potentially in use.\n\nYou may verify your DNSCrypt-proxy by following the next steps.\n• Click Extended test button and wait for the test to complete.\n• You should see the list of your DNSCrypt servers similar to the one below.\n\nA quick method to ascertain if your DNS queries are being “leaked” from your network is to disable DNSCrypt-proxy. Upon shutdown, all DNS queries should be unsuccessful when attempting to access a website, for example. Upon re-enabling it, you should regain the ability to resolve domain names. Even if DNS lookups are leaking from your network, you will still be able to access websites and other resources inside your network. If that is the case, your devices are using another DNS server for lookups.\n\ntool may be used to ascertain the presence of outbound unencrypted traffic. To capture the outgoing DNS packets, you may run the following command on OPNsense CLI.\n\nThere should be no packets in the output, as given below.\n\nAdditionally, you may capture the traffic sent to a DNSCrypt server that you are using by running the following command on OPNsense CLI. Then, you should see the packets belonging to DNS queries and responses.\n\nFor our example, we may capture the traffic for AdGuard DNS server using the IP address shown in the figure 6 by running the next command.\n\nYou may add DNSBL types, such as AdAway List, AdGuard List and Simple Ad List, to block advertisements and then visit the site. You should see the Adblocker Test page, which is similar to the one below.\n\nTesting MSN before the Ads are blocked\n\nFree DNSCrypt-enabled resolvers are accessible globally. You may find an interactive list of public DNS servers at .\n\nAn interactive map of public DNS servers is available at: .\n\nDNSCrypt servers used for parental control are available at: .\n\nAn extensive list of public DNS resolvers supporting the\n\nDNSCrypt and DNS-over-HTTP2 protocols is accessible at:\n\nDNSCrypt-proxy is a powerful DNS proxy. It operates on your computer or router, enabling local blockage of undesirable information, disclosing the destinations of data transmissions from your devices, enhancing application performance via DNS response caching, and bolstering security and secrecy by using secure routes for communication with upstream DNS servers. DNSCrypt-proxy has the following capabilities.\n• Filtering: Blocks advertisements, viruses, and further undesirable content. Compatible with all DNS providers.\n• Encryption and authentication of DNS communication. Facilitates DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) using TLS 1.3 and QUIC, DNSCrypt, Anonymized DNS, and ODoH. Client IP addresses may be concealed via Tor, SOCKS proxies, or Anonymized DNS relays.\n• Cloaking that may be used for local growth and to provide secure search outcomes on Google, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, and Bing.\n• Load balancing by allowing administrators to choose a group of resolvers. In such cases, DNScrypt-proxy will automatically assess and monitor their performance, distributing traffic among the quickest available options.\n• Monitoring DNS requests, using distinct log files for standard and anomalous inquiries\n• Clear routing of designated domains to certain resolvers\n• Can force outbound connections to use TCP\n\nThe main reasons and advantages of deploying DNSCrypt on a network are as follows.\n• Both UDP and TCP may be used for transport.\n• Extremely straightforward to do; necessitates just two conventional cryptography frameworks.\n• Eliminates the need for a TLS stack, thus reducing the attack surface.\n• Cannot be subjected to man-in-the-middle attacks via traditional techniques\n• Does not depend on X509 certificates and Certificate Authorities.\n• Does not possess any insecure parameters\n• DNSCrypt and DoH may be concurrently served on the same port.\n• Standard DNS and DNSCrypt may use the same port, however port 443 is recommended owing to routers sometimes intercepting port 53."
