This tag is appended to the name, so, for example, an ivar named height of type float might be called height_i_f. Similarly, every class ends in the capital letter \"C\".\n\nThis scheme forces you into the solution space (programming language) and distracts you from the problem space.\n\nNames are vitally important, for the same reason they are important in non-OO languages, but also because of the anthropomorphic nature of OO programming.\n\nIt is common in OO languages to name things with the name of the class and a definite or indefinite article ( Control, aController; View, theView). These names are fine when something more appropriate can't be found (List, employees)."

        "document": "Programmers employ numerous tactics to ensure readable and organized code. These include:\n• None adding comments throughout to aid in interpretation.\n\nIn this tutorial we will examine these concepts.\n\nVariable naming is an important aspect in making your code readable. Naming variables follow a simple idea: Create variables that describe their function and which follow a consistent theme throughout your code. Let’s take a look at some naming conventions. This convention is to separate words in a variable name without the use of whitespace. Whitespace within variables is usually difficult for programming languages to interpret. Because of this variables must be delimited in some way. Here are several delimiting conventions commonly used in code: Words are delimited by an underscore. Words are delimited by capital letters, except the initial word. This notation describes the variable type or purpose at the start of the variable name, followed by a descriptor that indicates the variable’s function. The Camelcase notation is used to delimit words. These conventions are by no means binding, but instead examples of how many programmers format their code. Consistency and readability are key ideas that should be utilized in the naming of variables. Regardless of how you choose to name your variables, always ensure that your naming conventions are consistent throughout the code. Consistency allows others to more easily understand your code.\n\nMuch like variable naming conventions, functions and classes should also follow a similar structure of descriptive titles delimited with the conventions described above. An important aspect of naming is to ensure your classes, functions, and variables can be distinguished from each other. For example, one could use Camelcase and Pascalcase for functions and classes respectively, while reserving Snakecase or Hungarian notation for variable names. Distinguishing functions, classes, and variables with different naming conventions can greatly aid other users of your code, and can eliminate the need for large sections of comments that would otherwise be needed.\n\nWhitespace and tabbing are critical for organizing code. Whitespace is any space in your code that is not taken up by readable characters. Tabbing is one way to create whitespace in consistent units using the ‘tab’ key. While some languages ignore whitespace and tabbing all together, others entirely rely on the concept. Because of this, it is important to ensure your code is consistently organized. Whitespace and tabbing are often used to clarify nested loops and logical statements. Let’s look at some examples of C code that demonstrate the effect of whitespace. It is important to note that like variable naming, whitespace can be utilized in various different styles and approaches. Just remember to use whitespace and tabbing in a consistent, readable style throughout your code."

        "document": "Proper naming conventions and best practices for classes and objects are essential for writing readable, maintainable, and Pythonic code. Though Python is a flexible language without strict naming rules, adhering to a consistent naming style will make your code easier to understand and use by others. This guide covers the key naming conventions and best practices for class and object names in Python.\n\nPython’s PEP 8 Style Guide provides general naming conventions and best practices for Python code:\n• Use for module, package, function, method, variable, and constant names.\n• Avoid single letter names except for counters or iterators.\n• Names should be descriptive yet succinct.\n\nAdditionally, these key points apply specifically for naming classes and objects in Python:\n• Class names should use the or convention.\n• Object and instance names should use .\n• Names should clearly communicate the purpose or function of the class or object.\n• Base class names are typically abstract using words like , or .\n\nLet’s examine proper naming conventions and best practices for classes and objects in more detail.\n\nClass names should be descriptive and communicate the design’s intent and purpose clearly. Here are key guidelines for Python class naming:\n• Use or : Class names should start with a capital letter and use CamelCase.\n• Use singular nouns: Class names should be singular nouns since they represent one instance of something.\n• Clear and descriptive: Class name should indicate what it contains and represents.\n• Not too long: Balance being descriptive but succinct. Long names can reduce readability.\n• No implementation details: Avoid implementation details like “Widget” or “Manager”.\n• Use base class naming conventions: Base class names often use , , or .\n• Use : Object and instance names should use .\n• Descriptive and unambiguous: Clearly convey what the object represents.\n• Avoid single letters: Use more than one letter to avoid confusion.\n• Differ from class name: Instance names should not replicate class names.\n• Can abbreviate: Abbreviations are OK if the meaning is unambiguous.\n\nMethod names follow the same conventions as functions in Python:\n• Arguments should match names used in method.\n• Use double leading underscores to avoid subclass name collisions for private attributes.\n\nHere are some examples of classes and objects that follow best practices for naming in Python:\n\nThe class and object names clearly convey their purpose and adhere to naming conventions.\n\nHere are some common naming convention mistakes to avoid:\n\nWhile Python itself doesn’t enforce strict naming rules, it’s important to remain consistent in naming conventions across a codebase. Define a style guide for your project or organization and stick to it. Some options include:\n\nUsing linters like Pylint can help enforce naming conventions and style consistency in a project.\n\nProper naming conventions are important for writing Python code that is easy to understand and maintain. While Python itself is flexible with naming, sticking to the standard CapWords for classes, lowercase_underscores for objects, and descriptive names will make your Python codebase more readable and Pythonic. Consistency in naming across a codebase is key. Defining and adopting a style guide for your project will enable consistency and best practices."

        "document": "They say one of the most difficult tasks as a software developer is naming things but it is also one of the most important practices to have meaningful names when defining variables, functions, classes and everything in between.\n\n Following good practices and naming conventions can make your code more readable and maintainable, and it most certainly will make it easier for other people to understand and work with it.\n\nBut how can we do that? What are the good and bad practices when naming things in software development?\n\nI like to think of coding almost as writing a book, where I would try to guide the reader to follow a clear structure with meaningful names that helps them to stay on the right path of what they are looking for.\n\nOne suggestion that I like to follow when coding is to pause and think \"What is my motivation to create this?\". That makes you focus on the bigger picture other than the immediate problem-solving mindset according to the book The Pragmatic Programmer by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt (excellent read by the way).\n\nFollowing up on the same reference mentioned above, there is a great example of why naming things right matters.\n\n Let’s do a quick exercise to see this in practice:\n\n Take a look at the image below and then follow the quick instructions, it won’t take more than a minute, I promise!\n• None Say the words out loud as they are written.\n• None Now say the words out loud according to their colour.\n\nEven if you succeeded in the second step, you probably had to put more effort into it, didn’t you?\n\n This is just a quick example to show that what is written takes precedence in our brains, even if the context around it means a different thing.\n\nNow that we have an idea of how important it is to name things right, let’s take a look at some strategies:\n\nVariables are the smallest piece but usually the most significant since they are the base composition of the entire application. Naming them wrong may feel like a domino effect, where all the subsequent variables rely on the wrong meaning of previous ones.\n\n Let’s look at some practices to avoid that:\n• Keep it short but meaningful\n\nAbbreviations may help with making your code smaller, but they make it extra complicated to understand the meaning of the variable in place. Unless you are working in a very constrained environment like embedded systems you should consider avoiding the abbreviations.\n\n Abbreviations may seem intuitive to the person writing the code and even to people that have a clear understanding of the product but it may be a big blocker for people reading it for the first time (sometimes even second, third, …)\n\nMany programs use generic names on variables, sometimes because of patterns we learn early in our careers and keep using it like . \n\n Other times it is just because we are trying to keep the code somehow generic to facilitate extending it. No matter what the reasoning is, consider using clear and specific names other than super generic ones, unless you don’t have a choice.\n\n The problem with generic names is that it doesn’t represent what the current piece of code is supposed to do because generic names usually bring also a sense of ambiguity.\n\n Let’s take a look at a quick example:\n\nIn the example above, if your codebase manages multiple types of users it may be tricky to know all possible paths every function needs to follow/check. That will force you to read the whole function to see what can happen for each type of user. It would be way better to be able to assume what a function does just by reading its signature, wouldn't it?\n\nTo avoid this problem, first, make sure that the variable name reflects the intention of what it is being used for. Next, double-check that it has a clear and unique meaning of what it represents.\n\nThis is a very scary one where it usually happens during maintenance, refactoring or change in the codebase where someone accidentally forgets to rename the variable right after changing what it represents.\n\n This is extremely harmful because it guides the next readers directly to a misinterpretation of the code. Therefore it requires a lot of effort to understand, and maintain and it is usually the reason why weird and complicated comments and documentations exist.\n\nTo avoid this issue, make sure that whenever you change a code you also rename the variables according to their context. Follow the first steps described here when applying code changes too, chances are you might not only avoid misleading names but also fix existing poorly named variables in place.\n\n💊 Keep it short but meaningful\n\nit is always good to have a very short variable name and we should aim for that as long as it represents what it means. But keep in mind that meaningful names take precedence over short names, so try to focus on the meaning first.\n\nAll of the suggestions about variables also apply here when naming functions. By following that, it will help you to describe the right context that the function represents.\n\n But on top of that, other than providing a clear context we also need to explicitly show what action this function is supposed to perform.\n\nHere are some quick suggestions:\n• Functions should use and be clear about what action it performs;\n\nHere is a quick reference about what prefix you can use to explicitly describe the intention of your function:\n\nBe sure that your function does not do multiple actions.\n\n Whenever your function contains an in the name or anything that reminds you that you most certainly are doing many things and you should consider splitting it up into multiple functions.\n\n E.g.\n\nThe format above just makes it too verbose and therefore less readable in most cases.\n\nConsider splitting it up:\n\nBut what if they need to be executed in sequence?\n\n No problem, just create a function that acts as an aggregator\n\nWhen dealing with functions it is very common to see very generic parameters and that can also be a big problem. whenever you have a poorly named function parameter it would result in the same problems we talked about in the naming variables section.\n\nLet's look at the following example:\n\nThe parameter doesn't clearly state what is being updated in the user instance.\n\n Is it the username? Age? Is it every single attribute?\n\n You won't be able to know unless you read the whole function and see what the code does.\n\nTo avoid that, be explicit about what attributes the function is supposed to be handling changes.\n\n One way to do that is to list every attribute as a separate parameter of the function:\n\nIf the list of attributes is too long, consider the use of a (Data Transfer Object) or a similar strategy to make the function readable but still specific.\n\nNaming methods is very similar to naming functions, the main difference here is that the context is somewhat explicit already, since you are evoking the method from a specific class.\n\nFor example, an isolated function to a new user can be defined as the one below:\n\nWhen defining the same functionality through a method of a class, for example, you can ignore the context part of the name, since it is already implicit by the class name:\n\nWhen naming classes you should keep in mind what is the main purpose of the class that you are creating. If you find that the class is too broad and can be used to manage multiple contexts, consider rethinking it and splitting it up. Defining too broad and long classes is one of the reasons why generic names are applied here and we should try to avoid that.\n\nThe most straightforward class definitions are the ones that represent a domain model, like a , , , etc. But we know that programs never stop there and we always stumble on broad classes every now and then.\n\nHere are some quick suggestions:\n• Keep it simple and descriptive;\n• Use CamelCase (or your preferred language default)\n• Use whole words and avoid acronyms and abbreviations\n\nAbstractions are a great way to make your code decoupled and testable, but naming it wrong may only complicate things.\n\nHere are some quick suggestions to follow:\n• Clearly state that this is an abstraction/interface according to your preferred language:\n• It should represent a clear context or group of contexts:\n\nFirst of all, when defining make sure that you need it. If your enum contains only a single value it should be a constant or even a simple boolean attribute.\n\n E.g.\n\nNow that you confirmed that you need an enum, you can apply the same suggestions of classes and variables definitions here.\n• Be clear about in what context it should be used:\n\nModule names should represent a group of functionalities that belong to the same general context. Your modules may vary a lot based on your own company's guidelines but some general rules can be applied to make sure that your package name makes sense.\n\nOne great suggestion I like to follow is the one found on Google's python styleguide, where you should be able to call a public code from a package using its full path, for example:\n\nIf you can follow the example above and it is easy to follow what the code does and where it comes from, then you can confirm that your package name is clear enough.\n\nEvery language, framework and even companies have their set of guidelines to name things, and the goal is to make sure that we are writing code that is going to be easy to understand by other people and our future selves.\n\n Next time you code, try to see yourself as an author and apply these practices to guide you through the process. Your future self and every reader of your code will be thankful for that!\n\nThanks for making to the end, leave a like and comment if the article was helpful to you!"

        "document": "Design Patterns in C sharp (C#)\n\nDesign patterns in C Sharp (C#) help developers create maintainable, flexible, and understandable code. They encapsulate the expertise and experience of seasoned software architects and developers, making it easier for newer programmers to follow established best practices.\n\n1. What are Design Patterns in C sharp (C#)?\n\nDesign patterns are defined as reusable solutions to the common problems that arise during software design and development. They are general templates or best practices that guide developers in creating well-structured, maintainable, and efficient code.\n\n2. Types of Design Patterns in C sharp (C#)\n\nSeveral types of design patterns are commonly used in software development. These patterns can be categorized into three main groups:\n\n.Creational Design Patterns in C sharp (C#)\n\nCreational design patterns abstract the instantiation process. They help make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented. A class creational pattern uses inheritance to vary the class that’s instantiated, whereas an object creational pattern will delegate instantiation to another object. Creational patterns give a lot of flexibility in what gets created, who creates it, how it gets created, and, when.\n\nThere are two recurring themes in these patterns:\n• None They all encapsulate knowledge about which concrete class the system uses.\n• None They hide how instances of these classes are created and put together.\n\n3.1 Factory Method Design Pattern in C sharp (C#)\n\nFactory Method or Factory Design Patterns also known as virtual constructor, it define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.\n\nWhen to use Factory Method\n• None A class can’t anticipate the class of objects it must create.\n• None A class wants its subclass to specify the objects it creates.\n• None Classes delegate responsibility to one of several helper subclasses, and you want to localize the knowledge of which helper subclass is the delegate.\n\nLet's understand Factory Method by using an example:\n• None If multiple clients need to create instances of vehicles, the code for creating those instances might be duplicated across different parts of the application.\n• None Creating instances of concrete classes directly ties the client code to those specific classes.\n• None The Client code could become cluttered with the details of object creation, making it harder to read and understand.\n\nThen how Factory Pattern provides a centralized and abstract way to create objects for the above problem?\n\nIn the below code the class is responsible for creating instances of the requested vehicles based on the provided . The client class ( ) uses the factory to build vehicles and then interacts with the created vehicles without knowing their specific implementations.\n\nBelow is the Code for the above problem statement:\n\n3.2 Abstract Factory Method Design Pattern in C sharp (C#)\n\nAbstract Factory design pattern is one of the Creational pattern. Abstract Factory pattern is almost similar to Factory Pattern and is considered as another layer of abstraction over factory pattern. Abstract Factory patterns work around a super-factory which creates other factories.\n\nLet's understand Abstract Factory Method by using an example:\n• None Direct instantiation of car objects without an abstract factory would tightly couple the client code to concrete car classes and their instantiation logic.\n• None Adding a new type of car or a new location would require modifying the existing client code, violating the Open/Closed Principle of software design.\n• None The lack of a centralized and abstract way to create objects can reduce code readability and maintainability.\n\nHow we Abstract Factory Pattern gonna solve the above problem?\n\nThe Below code provides an abstract base class and concrete implementations for each type of car. There are also separate factory classes for different locations ( , , and ). The class acts as an abstract factory that decides which concrete factory to use based on the specified location.\n\nBelow is the Code for the above problem statement:\n\n3.3 Singleton Method Design Pattern in C sharp (C#)\n\nSingleton pattern is a design pattern which restricts a class to instantiate its multiple objects. It is nothing but a way of defining a class.\n• None Class is defined in such a way that only one instance of the class is created in the complete execution of a program or project.\n• None When the sole instance should be extensible by subclassing and clients should be able to use an extended instance without modifying\n• None Singleton classes are used for logging, driver objects, caching, and thread pool, database connections.\n\nLet's understand Singleton Method by using an example:\n\nHow we are gonna solve this problem using Singleton Pattern?\n\nThe class has a private constructor, a private static instance, and a public static method that returns the instance. The method demonstrates the usage of the Singleton pattern by calling the method and then invoking the method on the obtained instance.\n\nBelow is the Code for the above problem statement:\n\n3.4 Prototype Method Design Pattern in C sharp (C#)\n\nPrototype allows us to hide the complexity of making new instances from the client. The concept is to copy an existing object rather than creating a new instance from scratch, something that may include costly operations. The existing object acts as a prototype and contains the state of the object. The newly copied object may change same properties only if required. This approach saves costly resources and time, especially when object creation is a heavy process.\n\nLet's understand Prototype Method by using an example:\n\nHow Prototype design pattern help to solve this problem?\n\nThe Prototype design pattern allows us to create new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. In this scenario, we can define a prototype interface, say , which declares a method to clone the object. Concrete classes like , , and implement this interface.\n\nBelow is the Code for the above problem statement:\n\n3.5 Build er Method Design Pattern in C sharp (C#)\n\nBuilder pattern aims to “Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.” It is used to construct a complex object step by step and the final step will return the object. The process of constructing an object should be generic so that it can be used to create different representations of the same object.\n\nLet's understand Builder Method by using an example:\n\nHow Builder Pattern gonna help to solve this problem:\n\nThe builder design pattern, we can address these problems, providing a clear and concise way to construct objects with many optional components while improving code readability, maintainability, and flexibility.\n\nIn the below code:\n• None There are two types of builders: . Each builder knows how to build a specific type of house with its unique features.\n• None class is responsible for orchestrating the construction process, using a specific builder to build a house with the desired components.\n• None ) showcases the construction of an igloo house by creating an instance of , and then instructing the engineer to construct the house.\n• None The resulting house is then printed out.\n\nBelow is the Code for the above problem statement:\n\n4. Structural Design Patterns in C sharp (C#)\n\nStructural Design Patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. Structural class patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces or implementations. Consider how multiple inheritances mix two or more classes into one. The result is a class that combines the properties of its parent classes.\n\nThere are two recurring themes in these patterns:\n• None This pattern is particularly useful for making independently developed class libraries work together.\n• None Structural Design Patterns describe ways to compose objects to realize new functionality.\n• None The added flexibility of object composition comes from the ability to change the composition at run-time, which is impossible with static class composition.\n\n4.1 Adapter Method Design Patterns in C sharp (C#)\n\nThis pattern is easy to understand as the real world is full of adapters.\n\nIn design, adapters are used when we have a class (Client) expecting some type of object and we have an object (Adaptee) offering the same features but exposing a different interface.\n\nLet's understand Adapter Method by using an example:\n• None The method names and signatures in\n• None Modifying the existing system to work with directly would require changes to its code, leading to disruptions and potentially breaking the existing functionality.\n\nHow Adapter Pattern gonna help to solve this problem:\n\nThe Adapter Pattern makes the compatible with the interface expected by the existing system.\n\nIn the below code:\n• Target Interface: that represents the operations expected by the existing system.\n• Adapter Class: and wraps an instance of to the corresponding method in\n\nBelow is the Code for the above problem statement:\n\n4.2 Bridge Method Design Patterns in C sharp (C#)\n\nThe bridge pattern allows the Abstraction and the Implementation to be developed independently and the client code can access only the Abstraction part without being concerned about the Implementation part.\n\nLet's understand Bridge Method by using an example:\n\nHow Bridge Pattern gonna help to solve this problem:\n\nBy using the Bridge design pattern, you can address these challenges by separating abstraction from implementation. This allows for greater flexibility, extensibility, and maintainability in your system, making it easier to add new types of vehicles or workshops independently.\n\nIn the below code:\n• None The Bridge pattern allows the abstraction (vehicle) and its implementation (workshop) to vary independently\n• None There is a common abstraction, represented by the class, which has references to two workshops.\n• None method, combining the workshops to showcase the manufacturing process.\n• None interface defines the methods that workshops must implement, and two concrete implementations ( ) represent different steps in the manufacturing process.\n• None class demonstrates the usage of the Bridge pattern by creating instances of cars and bikes, associating them with specific workshops, and then manufacturing each vehicle, showing the steps of production.\n\nBelow is the Code for the above problem statement:\n\n4.3 Composite Method Design Patterns in C sharp (C#)\n\nComposite pattern is a partitioning design pattern and describes a group of objects that is treated the same way as a single instance of the same type of object. The intent of a composite is to “compose” objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It allows you to have a tree structure and ask each node in the tree structure to perform a task.\n\nLet's understand Composite Method by using an example:\n\nHow Composite Pattern gonna help to solve this problem:\n\nBy applying the Composite design pattern, you can address these challenges, allowing you to treat both individual employees and groups uniformly, simplifying your code, and providing a more consistent and scalable solution.\n\nIn the below code:\n• None , which all employee classes implement. This interface includes a method to display the details of an employee.\n• None classes are concrete implementations of employees with specific attributes such as employee ID, name, and position.\n• None class serves as a composite, representing a group of employees. It implements the interface, allowing both individual employees and groups of employees to be treated uniformly. It can contain a list of objects, which can be either individual employees or subgroups (other instances of\n• None class acts as the client code, creating instances of individual employees (Developers and Managers) and organizing them into composite structures using . It then demonstrates the use of the Composite pattern by displaying the details of the entire employee structure\n\nBelow is the Code for the above problem statement:\n\n4.4 Decorator Method Design Patterns in C sharp (C#)\n\nThe Decorator pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. It involves creating a set of decorator classes that are used to wrap concrete components. These decorators add new functionalities to the objects they decorate by providing alternative processing pathways.\n\nLet's understand Decorator Method by using an example:\n\nHow Decorator Pattern gonna help to solve this problem:\n\nDecorator Pattern allow customers to customize their pizza orders by adding various toppings dynamically without modifying the existing pizza classes. It's like having a versatile system that adapts to various customer preferences, making the pizza customization process smooth and scalable.\n\nIn the below code:\n• None representing the base pizza, with concrete pizza classes such as\n• None There is an abstract decorator class , which represents additional toppings that can be added to the pizza.\n• None class serves as the driver program, creating instances of pizzas and decorating them with various toppings.\n\nBelow is the Code for the above problem statement:\n\n4.5 Facade Method Design Patterns in C sharp (C#)\n\nThe Facade Pattern is a design pattern in software engineering that falls under the structural pattern category. It provides a simplified and unified interface to a set of interfaces or subsystems within a larger system, making it easier to use and reducing the complexity of the system for clients. Essentially, it acts as a facade or entry point to a more complex system, shielding clients from its intricacies.\n\nLet's understand Facade Method by using an example:\n\nHow Facade Pattern gonna help to solve this problem:\n\nThe Facade Pattern hides the complexities of the engine and lights subsystems, offering a straightforward way to interact with the car. It's like having a user-friendly control panel, making the car operation more accessible and user-friendly.\n\nIn the below code:\n• None Created a subsystem for the engine with functionalities to start and stop the engine.\n• None Developed another subsystem for lights with features to turn them on and off.\n• None that encapsulates the interactions with the engine and lights subsystems.\n• None to start the engine, turn on the lights, and indicate the car is ready to drive. Additionally, it should have to turn off the lights, stop the engine, and indicate the car has stopped.\n• None Demonstrated the usage of the method, showcasing how the Facade pattern simplifies the process of starting and stopping the car without dealing with the complexities of individual subsystems.\n\nBelow is the Code for the above problem statement:\n\n4.6 Flyweight Method Design Patterns in C sharp (C#)\n\nFlyweight pattern is one of the structural design patterns as this pattern provides ways to decrease object count thus improving application required objects structure. Flyweight pattern is used when we need to create a large number of similar objects (say 105). One important feature of flyweight objects is that they are immutable. This means that they cannot be modified once they have been constructed.\n\nLet's understand Flyweight Method by using an example:\n\nHow Flyweight Pattern gonna help to solve this problem:\n\nThe Flyweight pattern is used to optimize memory usage by sharing common intrinsic attributes among similar objects. For example the intrinsic attributes like the mission type (\"PLANT A BOMB\" for Terrorists and \"DIFFUSE BOMB\" for Counter-Terrorists). Extrinsic attributes, such as the weapon a player carries, are assigned dynamically.\n\nIn the below code:\n• Player Factory ( ): Responsible for creating and managing player objects. Uses a to store and retrieve players based on their type.\n• Driver Class ( ): Main class demonstrating the Flyweight pattern. Creates and assigns weapons to players in a Counter-Strike game simulation.\n\nBelow is the Code for the above problem statement:\n\n4.7. Proxy Method Design Patterns in C sharp (C#)\n\nA Proxy is a design pattern that allows one object to stand in for another. It acts as a substitute or placeholder, controlling access to the real object. With a Proxy, you can execute actions before or after a request reaches the actual object, giving you the ability to manage and modify the behavior of the real object transparently.\n\nLet's understand Proxy Method by using an example:\n\nHow Proxy Pattern gonna help to solve this problem:\n\nProxy Pattern acts as a protective barrier between you and the sensitive operations. Before you can deposit, withdraw, or check balance, the proxy ensures there's proper authentication.\n\nIn the below code:\n• None The code we will design should defines two classes, acting as a proxy that controls access to the real bank account.\n• None The proxy requires a password for authentication, and if the password is correct, it allows operations like depositing money, withdrawing money, and checking the account balance.\n• None The client code demonstrates using the proxy to perform these operations on the bank account.\n\nBelow is the Code for the above problem statement:\n\n5. Behavioral Design Patterns in C sharp (C#)\n\nBehavioral Patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. Behavioral patterns describe not just patterns of objects or classes but also the patterns of communication between them. These patterns characterize complex control flow that’s difficult to follow at run-time.\n\nThere are three recurring themes in these patterns:\n• None Behavioral class patterns use inheritance to distribute behavior between classes.\n• None Behavioral object patterns use object composition rather than inheritance.\n• None Behavioral object patterns are concerned with encapsulating behavior in an object and delegating requests to it.\n\n5.1. Chain of Responsibility Method Design Pattern in C sharp (C#)\n\nChain of responsibility pattern is used to achieve loose coupling in software design where a request from the client is passed to a chain of objects to process them. Later, the object in the chain will decide themselves who will be processing the request and whether the request is required to be sent to the next object in the chain or not.\n\nLet's understand Chain of Responsibilty Method by using an example:\n\nHow Chain of Responsibilty Pattern gonna help to solve this problem:\n\nUsing the Chain of Responsibility design pattern, a flexible and extensible system is designed to handle numeric operations. Multiple processors form a chain, each capable of independently deciding whether to handle a numeric request or pass it to the next processor in the chain.\n\nIn the below code:\n• Processors: ) handle requests based on being negative, zero, or positive.\n• Number Class: class represents the request with an integer value.\n• Processing Requests: Each processor decides to handle or pass the request to the next processor.\n• Client (TestChain): Demonstrates creating a chain and passing numbers through for processing.\n• Outputs which processor handles each type of number in the chain.\n\nBelow is the Code for the above problem statement:\n\n5.2.Command Method Design Pattern in C sharp (C#)\n\nThe command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting us parameterize other objects with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.\n\nLet's understand Command Method by using an example:\n\nHow Command Pattern gonna help to solve this problem:\n\nThe Command Pattern encapsulates each command as an object. This decouples the sender from the specific operations of the receiver. The remote control only needs to know how to execute a generic command interface, and new commands can be easily added without modifying the sender.\n\nIn the below code:\n• Remote Control Setup: ) with a single button. The remote control is designed to work with any command that implements the\n• Commands: Commands are represented by classes that implement the\n• Command Execution: The remote control can be dynamically configured with different commands. When you press the button on the remote control, it executes the associated command.\n\nBelow is the Code for the above problem statement:\n\n5.3. Observer Method Design Pattern in C sharp (C#)\n\nThe Observer Pattern defines a one to many dependency between objects so that one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.\n• None One to many dependency is between Subject(One) and Observer(Many).\n• None There is dependency as Observers themselves don’t have access to data. They are dependent on Subject to provide them data.\n\nLet's understand Observer Method by using an example:\n\nHow Observer Pattern gonna help to solve this problem:\n\nUsing Observer pattern helps to make a flexible and loosely coupled system where new displays can be added without modifying the code.\n\nIn the below code:\n\nThe acts as the subject, and instances act as observers.\n• None Displays can be dynamically added or removed from observation.\n• None When the weather changes ( is called), all registered displays are automatically updated (\n\nBelow is the Code for the above problem statement:\n\n5.4 State Method Design Pattern in C sharp (C#)\n\nThe state pattern is one of the behavioral design patterns. A state design pattern is used when an Object changes its behavior based on its internal state. If we have to change the behavior of an object based on its state, we can have a state variable in the Object and use the if-else condition block to perform different actions based on the state. The state pattern is used to provide a systematic and lose-coupled way to achieve this through Context and State implementations.\n\nLet's understand State Method by using an example:\n\nHow State Pattern gonna help to solve this problem:\n\nThe State design pattern is that it allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern encapsulates states into separate classes, and the object delegates the state-specific behavior to these classes.\n\nIn the below code:\n\nclass represents the context that can be in different states ( , , ).\n• None method of each state is called based on the current state, and it performs actions accordingly.\n• None method is used to transition between states.\n• None This pattern allows the context to behave differently based on its internal state, making it more flexible and maintainable.\n\nBelow is the Code for the above problem statement:\n\n5.5. Strategy Method Design Pattern in C sharp (C#)\n\nStrategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows the behavior of an object to be selected at runtime. It is one of the Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns, which are widely used in object-oriented programming. The Strategy pattern is based on the idea of encapsulating a family of algorithms into separate classes that implement a common interface.\n\nLet's understand Strategy Method by using an example:\n\nHow Strategy Pattern gonna help to solve this problem:\n\nBy applying the Strategy Pattern, you can address these challenges by encapsulating each payment method in a separate strategy class. This promotes code reuse, modularity, and easier extensibility without modifying existing code. It also allows for dynamic switching between payment strategies, making the system more flexible and scalable.\n\nIn the below code:\n• PaymentProcessor Class: This is the context class that holds a reference to the current payment strategy. It has a method that delegates the payment processing to the strategy.\n• Client Code (Program class): The client creates an instance of the and sets its payment strategy dynamically by calling . This allows the client to switch between different payment methods seamlessly.\n\nBelow is the Code for the above problem statement:\n\n5.6. Template Method Design Pattern in C sharp (C#)\n\nTemplate method design pattern is to define an algorithm as a skeleton of operations and leave the details to be implemented by the child classes. The overall structure and sequence of the algorithm are preserved by the parent class.\n\nLet's understand Template Method by using an example:\n\nHow Template Pattern gonna help to solve this problem:\n\nThis Template Method pattern ensures that the overall algorithm's structure remains consistent across different implementations, allowing for code reuse, maintenance, and extensibility.\n\nIn the below code:\n• None , defining the overall structure of a report.\n• None ) according to their report types.\n• None are created, and the\n\nBelow is the Code for the above problem statement:\n\nThe Visitor pattern allows you to define new operations on an object structure without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates. The separation of concerns between the visitor and the elements being visited promotes extensibility and maintenance of the codebase.\n\nLet's understand Visitor Method by using an example:\n\nHow Visitor Pattern gonna help to solve this problem:\n\nThe Visitor pattern addresses these challenges by separating the operations into visitor classes. New operations can be added by introducing new visitor classes without modifying the existing element classes, promoting a more modular and extensible design.\n\nIn the below code:\n• None The client code can apply different visitors to elements without modifying the element classes.\n\nBelow is the Code for the above problem statement:\n\n5.8. Mediator design pattern in C sharp (C#)\n\nMediator pattern enables decoupling of objects by introducing a layer in between so that the interaction between objects happen via the layer. If the objects interact with each other directly, the system components are tightly-coupled with each other that makes higher maintainability cost and not hard to extend. Mediator pattern focuses on providing a mediator between objects for communication and help in implementing loose-coupling between objects\n\nLet's understand Mediator Method by using an example:\n\nHow Mediator Pattern gonna help to solve this problem:\n\nThe mediator acts as a centralized hub that handles the communication between users. Each user communicates only with the mediator, and the mediator then relays messages to the appropriate recipients.\n\nThe acts as a mediator between users ( objects), allowing them to send and receive messages without knowing the details of each other.\n\nBelow is the Code for the above problem statement:\n\n5.9. Memento Design Pattern in C sharp (C#)\n\nMemento pattern is a behavioral design pattern. Memento pattern is used to restore state of an object to a previous state. Intent of Memento Design pattern is without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object’s internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.\n\nLet's understand Memento Method by using an example:\n\nHow Memento Pattern gonna help to solve this problem:\n\nThe memento design pattern can be used to implement the undo and redo functionality. Each time a user performs an action, a snapshot (memento) of the editor's state is created and stored. Users can then undo or redo their actions by reverting to these saved states.\n• None is the originator that has the content, and the class acts as the caretaker, storing and managing the states (mementos).\n• None Users can undo changes by restoring the editor's state from the history.\n\nBelow is the Code for the above problem statement:\n\n5.10. Interpreter Design Pattern in C sharp (C#)\n\nInterpreter design pattern is one of the behavioral design pattern. Interpreter pattern is used to defines a grammatical representation for a language and provides an interpreter to deal with this grammar. This pattern involves implementing an expression interface which tells to interpret a particular context.This pattern performs upon a hierarchy of expressions. Each expression here is a terminal or non-terminal.\n• None The tree structure of Interpreter design pattern is somewhat similar to that defined by the composite design pattern with terminal expressions being leaf objects and non-terminal expressions being composites.\n• None The tree contains the expressions to be evaluated and is usually generated by a parser. The parser itself is not a part of the interpreter pattern.\n\nLet's understand Interpreter Method by using an example:\n\nHow Interpreter Pattern gonna help to solve this problem:\n\nThe Interpreter pattern is used to create a simple arithmetic expression language, allowing you to interpret and evaluate expressions.\n• Expression : There's an abstract class representing expressions in the language. There are two types of expressions - one for numbers ( ) and another for addition (\n• NumberExpression : Represents a numeric value in the expression.\n• AdditionExpression : Represents the addition operation in the expression, combining two sub-expressions.\n• Client Code (Program) : The client creates a specific expression, like \"1 + 2\", using instances of . Then, it interprets and evaluates the expression to get the result, which is printed to the console.\n\nBelow is the Code for the above problem statement:"

The same goes for software development! Design patterns are proven solutions to common problems, offering clear blueprints that make your code more efficient, reusable, and easier to maintain.\n\nIn this article, we’re diving deep into five must-know design patterns for C# developers. Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned pro, these patterns will help you write cleaner, more flexible, and robust code. Plus, we’ll sprinkle in some pro tips to supercharge your development skills!\n\n1. Singleton Pattern: The Power of One\n\nWhat Is It?\n\nThe Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance in your application and provides a global point of access to that instance. Think of it as the gatekeeper — there’s only one gatekeeper, and everyone in the system relies on that one instance.\n\nWhy Should You Use It?\n\nYou’ll use the Singleton pattern when you need to manage a shared resource, like logging, configuration settings, or a database connection. Having multiple instances could cause inconsistencies, resource wastage, or slowdowns.\n• You create a private static variable that holds the instance.\n• The class has a private constructor to prevent external instantiation.\n• Thread Safety Matters!: When using Singleton in multi-threaded environments, make sure to handle thread safety to avoid creating multiple instances. Use techniques like lazy initialization or double-checked locking."

On the other side of the wire I have a client that needs to be able to handle all the different types of messages.\n\nAll messages implement the same common interface IMessage. My problem is, when the client gets a new IMessage, how does it know what type of IMessage its received?\n\nI supposed I could do something like the following, but this just FEELS awful.\n\nThe second thought, is to add a property to IMessage called MessageTypeID, but that would require me to write something like the following, which also FEELS awful.\n\nI know this general problem has been tackled a million times, so there has to be a nicer way of solving the problem of having a method that takes an interface as a parameter, but needs different flow control based on what class has implemented that interface."
