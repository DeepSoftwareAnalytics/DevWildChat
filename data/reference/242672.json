Some bots focus on one specific aspect of the Telegram Bot API while others focus on one of the mechanics of this library. Except for the rawapibot.py example, they all use the high-level framework this library provides with the submodule.\n\nAll examples are licensed under the CC0 License and are therefore fully dedicated to the public domain. You can use them as the base for your own bots without worrying about copyrights.\n\nDo note that we ignore one pythonic convention. Best practice would dictate, in many handler callbacks function signatures, to replace the argument with an underscore, since is an unused local variable in those callbacks. However, since these are examples and not having a name for that argument confuses beginners, we decided to have it present.\n\nThis bot uses the class to send timed messages. The user sets a timer by using command with a specific time, for example . The bot then sets up a job to send a message to that user after 30 seconds. The user can also cancel the timer by sending . To learn more about the , read this wiki article. Note: To use , you must install PTB via\n\nA common task for a bot is to ask information from the user. In v5.0 of this library, we introduced the for that exact purpose. This example uses it to retrieve user-information in a conversation-like style. To get a better understanding, take a look at the state diagram.\n\nA even more complex example of a bot that uses the nested s. While it’s certainly not that complex that you couldn’t built it without nested s, it gives a good impression on how to work with them. Of course, there is a fancy state diagram for this example, too!\n\nA basic example of how Telegram WebApps can be used. Use in combination with the HTML page. For your convenience, this file is hosted by the PTB team such that you don’t need to host it yourself. Uses the iro.js JavaScript library to showcase a user interface that is hard to achieve with native Telegram functionality."
