        "document": "WeChat (parent company Tencent) launched its Mini Programs and Mini Games platform in 2017. In March 2019, Tencent opened its Mini Games platform to developers worldwide.\n\nWeChat boasts over one billion active users a month. It is the primary source of communication for a whole country, making it the number one app in China. Users maintain their social and professional contacts with it, sharing files and photos. It is the most used mobile payment solution in China, where cash payments are becoming more scarce.\n\nWeChat Mini Programs are an easy way to get your brand into the space because they have:\n• WeChat Integration. Users don’t have to download and install anything. They don’t have to log in again if they leave, and your Mini Program or Game can access the user’s WeChat account profiles and friends lists, and use WeChat Pay for purchases. Unlike nearly any comparable program in the Western world, you can safely assume that every Chinese user has a WeChat account and WeChat installed on their device(s).\n• Utility & Value. As opposed to a post, ad, or other marketing message, a Mini Program is interactive and promises to allow the user to do something useful, increasing the likelihood a person will install and use it.\n• High ability to go viral. While nothing is guaranteed, because they operate within China’s most popular social platform, your app has an increased likelihood of going viral because it can more easily be shared and pop up in front of more eyeballs.Incredibly large user base. With more than 1 billion monthly users, there is no larger app ecosystem in the world outside of Facebook.\n• Stability and Manageability. Mini Programs only operate within the WeChat program ecosystem, meaning they will work on any device that has WeChat installed, and users remain the WeChat platform when they are running them. They offer cross-platform compatibility right out of the box.\n• Easy support and upgrade threshold. They will be easier to support and upgrade as a result, although we still recommend testing across multiple devices and screen orientations to ensure a consistent user experience.\n• HTML5. You can leverage the power of the large, existing HTML5 ecosystem by easily converting HTML5 apps and games into WeChat Mini Games, no matter which game engine you used to develop them. The difficulty depends on the size of your original game and the framework it was based on, since WeChat Mini Programs do have size limits\n• Auto-update, which means they are a perfect sandbox for testing out new features, UX variations or interface designs for your native app.\n\nOne reason HTML5 games are popular in China is because they carry a lower traffic cost compared to native games, as many gamers on the Mainland still have limited data plans or no wifi access.\n\nHow Do Users Find WeChat Mini Programs or Games?\n\nUsers enter WeChat Mini Programs or Games primarily through these channels:\n• Recently accessed programs displayed in the user’s Mini Program history, or after pulling down the chat inbox\n• Discover > Games > My Mini Games, then search for “小游戏” (Mini Game)\n\nHow Do You Program a WeChat Mini Program or Game?\n\nWeChat Mini Programs only support JavaScript (the main programming language of the Web), but also languages that can be compiled to JavaScript, such as TypeScript and CoffeeScript.\n\nYou can also use the JavaScript APIs (application programming interfaces) that the WeChat Mini Games framework supports (Canvas 2D and WebGL) to draw graphics, animations, and do real-time rendering.\n\nThe three major game engine makers in China support WeChat Mini Games: Cocos Creator, Egret, and Laya. About 50% of the Mini Games on WeChat use the Cocos engine, with the second-most popular being Laya (25%).\n\nFor now, popular foreign HTML5 game engines such as Phaser.js, Three.js do not offer direct support, but can still be used with adaptations.\n\nPlease note that CSS and DOM cannot be used during development of a WeChat Mini Program or Game. This means you may have problems with some third-party libraries, such as JQuery (which uses the DOM API). Also, available storage space, memory and performance are lower than native apps, so be sure to test extensively for crashes.\n\nBe aware that WeChat Mini Programs don’t fully use the HTML5 standard. It just simulates these interfaces. So it can be better to develop with an engine that knows the limitations of the WeChat development environment and SDK.\n\nHow Do WeChat Mini Programs and Games launch?\n\nTo improve loading speed, WeChat launches the first-package and a sub-package with a maximum size of 8M. As this is unlikely to be large enough for your game, you will need to host some resource files on your own server.\n\nSo to get your program, a user scans your QR code, which will download a small program package from WeChat and complete its code initialization. Then the code in this package will request remote server resources as it executes, finally bringing the user to the first screen in your program or game. This is why it is important to control the size of your Mini Program or Game to get the best user experience and minimize load times.\n\nHow are Mini Programs different from Mini Games?\n\nHow To Get Started – The Hard Way\n\nYou will need to create a developer’s account with WeChat to begin developing your WeChat Mini Program or Game.\n\nNote: You must be a Chinese company or individual, or your company must have a Chinese entity (or WFOE), in order to publish a WeChat Mini Program or Mini Game. At this time, overseas companies and non-Chinese individuals can only open either a WeChat Official Service account or Subscription account – neither of which will allow you to develop Mini Programs or Games.\n\n1. Register Your Developer Account and Open A New Project\n• Go to the official WeChat account registration page.\n• Select “Mini Programs” and enter the required information to set up your account. If you are registering a game, select “Game” as the service category and “Casual Game” as the subcategory.\n• You will need to submit the required documents and licenses. Note that the same licenses you need for publishing a native app will be required for your WeChat Mini Program or App as well. For example, as your server will be in China, you will need an ICP beian at the very least.\n• A 300RMB fee will be required to verify your company identity with WeChat.\n• Approval of your official developer’s account generally takes 1-3 days. You will be contacted for additional documentation if your application is rejected.\n• Once approved, download the developer tools according to your operating system platform from the official WeChat Developer’s website.\n• In the Mini Program Management backend, register your mini program to get its AppID.\n• Open the WeChat development tools, and input the corresponding AppID and project name to start your project.\n• If your Mini Program or Game needs to accept payments, you must go through the process to register and verify a WeChat Pay account before you can integrate payments into your app.\n• js script logic file. This is the primary code file, the same as the PHP code file on the web, or Java code for Android apps.\n• Layout WXSS file, used to write the page layout. This is equivalent to XML layout code in android development, HTML code in web development, is used to write page layout.\n• WXSS files. This is the equivalent of CSS in web development, used to style the pages of your app.\n• On WeChat’s official website, you will find some official tutorials and the API documentation.\n\n3. Submit Your Mini Program or Game For Approval\n\nAfter your Mini Program or Game is complete, submit it to the WeChat team for review and approval. The approval process usually takes 1-3 days.\n\nNote that the same laws and content restrictions that apply to native apps in China also apply to WeChat Mini Programs and Games.\n\nLink: Legal Regulations and Content Restrictions on Apps in China\n\nHow To Get Started – The Easy Way\n\nAppInChina can quickly develop and publish a WeChat Mini Program for you, based on your specifications and needs. We can also streamline and help you avoid some of the paperwork and documentation normally required, while you retain full rights to your Mini Program. Depending on your needs, Mini Programs can be developed in as little as as 1-2 weeks. Contact us below for a quick custom quote."

        "document": "As of January 2022, WeChat Mini Programs have exceeded 450 million daily active users. In order to develop a program for this fast-growing market, you should understand some basics.\n\nIn general, Mini Programs are designed for users to duck quickly into and out of them to do specific tasks. So your user interface should be simple and easy to understand instantly for occasional users.\n\nAvoid anything that requires users to leave and return to your Mini Program. They should be able to accomplish all tasks in one quick session.\n\nBe sure that key elements of your Mini Program – such as crucial images, content, menus and interfaces – do not require a user to be online.\n\nDo not try to replicate the functionality of your native app. Instead, keep your Mini Program focused on offering your core features only, and direct users to download your native app for additional features. Depending on your app, you may also consider creating multiple Mini Programs that offer different sets of features.\n\nFor example, a traditional restaurant application and ordering app may offer restaurant search and reviews in one Mini Program, while confining the ordering features to a separate one.\n\nIn fact, if you reserve high-value tasks for your native app, it provides a strong incentive for users to download your native app and increase your DAU and organic reach. In this way, your Mini Program acts as an effective marketing tool for your core offering.\n\nDo not deviate from established Mini Program and WeChat conventions. Consider simplifying your navigation to single level, in which users can move horizontally forward and backward. Your navigation should be obvious. Keep a back button in your app on the top bar, as the standard back button on the Android phone will cause the user to exit the Mini Program entirely, causing frustration for users who accidentally tap it to go back. Study other Mini Programs and try to emulate their style to avoid reinventing the wheel.\n\nTest on as many different screen sizes and orientations as you can to make sure there are no content overflows. Also test on both iOS and Android devices.\n\nRemember that users who don’t often upgrade their WeChat app and/or device operating systems may experience errors with your program. To avoid them getting a blank white screen (otherwise known as a WSOD – White Screen of Death), have a good error handling system in place.\n\nLeverage the sharing abilities of your WeChat Mini Programs by including a well-composed sharing card and easy-to-see sharing options in the upper-right menu (where it normally appears). If you create additional value for users who share, it will incentivize and encourage users to spread your message and program. Take advantage of your ability to customize the Call To Action in these cards for each instance.\n\nAdd a pop-up notification to remind users to save the Mini Program to their favorites, so they can easily access it later. Users may forget to do this otherwise.\n\nAdd login walls only where they are truly needed. Users may exit your Mini Program immediately if the first thing they see is a prompt to log in before they can do anything else. A good rule of thumb is: If you don’t need user information, don’t ask for it.\n\nUse a simple, minimal “skeleton screen” that loads instantly while a user is waiting for your Mini Program to load. Also consider add a loading bar that clearly shows the user how long they will need to wait. Both of these tools help reduce bounce rates for users with a slow connection.\n\nUse the WeChat API to preload users’ information into forms, thus saving them time and increasing the value of the Mini Program.\n\nAppInChina builds WeChat Mini Programs for our clients.

Here’s a detailed step-by-step guide on how to navigate this challenging path.\n\nImportant Note: Eligibility for Non-Chinese Entities Before we delve into the steps, it’s crucial to understand that WeChat’s policies currently dictate that only Chinese companies, Chinese individuals, or companies with a Chinese entity (commonly known as a Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise or WFOE) are eligible to publish WeChat Mini Programs or Games. This means that if your organization doesn’t fall into one of these categories, you’ll encounter restrictions in developing and publishing on this platform.\n\nIf you don’t fit into any of the categories mentioned above, you’ll need to explore alternative options for entering the Chinese market, such as establishing a business presence in China. Options include setting up a WFOE, forming partnerships with Chinese companies, or exploring joint ventures. These approaches can provide the necessary legal framework for your organization to publish WeChat Mini Programs or Games.\n\n1. Register Your Developer Account and Open A New Project\n\nThe first step is to create a developer’s account with WeChat. While this process may seem straightforward, it’s essential to have a legal entity that qualifies under WeChat’s guidelines. This can be a challenging aspect, especially for non-Chinese entities.\n\nHere’s what you need to do:\n• Go to the official WeChat account registration page.\n• Select “Mini Programs” and fill in the required information, including service category and subcategory (e.g., “Game” and “Casual Game”).\n• Prepare to submit the necessary documents and licenses. This step closely resembles the requirements for publishing native apps in China. For instance, since your server will be in China, you will need an ICP Bei’an, among other possible licenses.\n• It’s important to note that the registration process requires a 300RMB fee for verifying your company’s identity with WeChat. Be prepared for a waiting period, as approval for your official developer’s account typically takes 1-3 days. If your application is rejected, you may be contacted for additional documentation.\n• Once your account is approved, download the developer tools according to your operating system platform from the official WeChat Developer’s website.\n• In the Mini Program Management backend, register your Mini Program to obtain its AppID.\n• Open the WeChat development tools, input the corresponding AppID and project name to start your project.\n• If your Mini Program or Game involves payment processing, you must go through the process to register and verify a WeChat Pay account before you can integrate payments into your app.\n\nThis process can be demanding, but it’s a critical step in developing a WeChat Mini Program or Game. Be prepared to navigate the intricacies and legal requirements.\n\nNow that you have your developer account set up, it’s time to start the technical development process. WeChat Mini Programs primarily support JavaScript and related languages like TypeScript and CoffeeScript. Additionally, the WeChat Mini Games framework provides APIs for graphics, animations, and real-time rendering.\n\nSeveral Chinese game engine makers, including Cocos Creator, Egret, and Laya, support WeChat Mini Games. However, some foreign HTML5 game engines may require adaptations to work seamlessly with the platform.\n\nOne important thing to note is that you cannot use CSS and DOM during the development of a WeChat Mini Program or Game. Additionally, performance may be lower than native apps, so rigorous testing and optimization are essential to ensure a smooth user experience.\n\nFor detailed guidance, you can find official tutorials and the API documentation on WeChat’s official website.\n\nEffective from September 1, 2023, a critical new step has been introduced for all apps seeking publication on app stores in China. Now, before you can launch your app, you must undergo the ICP Filing process. For existing apps in China, it’s equally vital to obtain a valid ICP Filing Number by March 31, 2024, to ensure your app’s continued presence on app stores.\n\nThe ICP Filing process is a mandatory legal requirement in China, ensuring compliance with the country’s stringent regulations for internet content and services. It serves as a fundamental step in the journey of launching your app to the Chinese market.\n\nFor detailed guidance on how to obtain a Mobile App ICP Filing Number in China, please refer to our comprehensive guide: How To Obtain a Mobile App ICP Filing Number in China.\n\nThis step is crucial to ensure that your app meets all the necessary legal requirements and maintains its visibility on app stores within China, making it an integral part of your development process.\n\n4. Submit Your Mini Program or Game For Approval\n\nAfter you’ve completed the development of your Mini Program or Game, the next crucial step is to submit it to the WeChat team for review and approval. The approval process typically takes 1-3 days.\n\nIt’s essential to understand that the same laws and content restrictions that apply to native apps in China also apply to WeChat Mini Programs and Games. Ensure your content complies with Chinese app regulations during the development process.\n\nLink: Legal Regulations and Content Restrictions on Apps in China\n\nBy adhering to these strict regulations, you can increase the chances of a successful approval for your WeChat Mini Program or Game.\n\nHow To Get Started – The Easy Way\n\nIf the hard way seems too daunting, consider using a service like 21YunBox to quickly develop and publish your WeChat Mini Program.
