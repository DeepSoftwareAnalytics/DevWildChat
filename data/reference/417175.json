        "document": "MS Excel is the go-to tool for data analytics, and for good reason. It gives you many capabilities to organize large datasets.\n\nWhether you want to filter specific data points or highlight similar data, you can simplify your dataset and service useful insights without getting lost in the volume of data.\n\nIn this article, we’ll walk you through the seven best ways to organize data in Excel and make your analysis process less overwhelming.\n\n7 best ways to organize data in your Excel file\n\nLet’s look at seven ways you can organize data in Excel strategically.\n\nConditional formatting helps visually categorize data points to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in a dataset.\n\nYou can set specific conditions for a row, column, or range of cells and define formatting rules, like cell color, bold, italics, etc. Excel will automatically analyze the data and format the cells based on your predefined conditions.\n\nThis feature makes the workbook visually informative and easily understandable to speed up your analysis.\n\nHere’s how you can apply conditional formatting to your data. Select a row, column, or range and go to the Conditional Formatting option in the ribbon. Set rules based on how you want to visualize the data, and Excel will apply them instantly.\n\nYou can use the sort option to organize data in an ascending or descending order of values. Excel lets you sort rows/columns by date, numbers, alphabets, and color. This way, you can convert raw data into structured data and identify the highest/lowest values.\n\nYou can also use multi-level sorting to manipulate the dataset any way you want.\n\nBesides sorting data points in Excel, you can use filters to dig deeper into specific parts of your dataset without changing or deleting anything from the original workbook.\n\nBy applying filters, you can see only those cells that meet your conditions and temporarily hide irrelevant details. It helps in drilling down the necessary details by customizing data visibility. While you can set custom conditions for filtering data, Excel also gives you these default filter options.\n\n💡Do it with Gigasheet: You can filter large datasets on Gigasheet in seconds. Simply select the row/column you want to filter and use the Filter feature to set conditions for filtering data. Unlike Excel, you can set multiple rules to create more advanced filters.\n\nFormulas give you a powerful way to organize data in Excel and manipulate the dataset with complex actions, like logical computations or statistical analysis.\n\nThere are multiple Excel formulas for data analysis to:\n• Join text strings in different cells to create new data\n\nFormulas help in organizing your data with maximum accuracy and efficiency.\n\nHere’s an example of the IF formula used to create a new row/column based on whether existing data points meet predefined criteria.\n\n💡Do it with Gigasheet: Writing complicated formulas can be headache. Instead of spending time figuring out the right formulas for any action, use Gigasheet’s range of features — like VLookup, data enrichment, data cleanup, and more — to perform these actions quickly.\n\nHere’s a snippet of different functions you can use on Gigasheet:\n\n4. Create named ranges to assign a name to cells\n\nNamed ranges let you assign a relevant name/tag to a range of cells, making it easy to create formulas for a large dataset. Instead of adding the default cell references, like A1, A2, etc., you can simply add the range name to your formulas and speed up the analysis process.\n\nYou can also use these range names to easily navigate your workbook and simplify data validation.\n\nHere’s how you can create a named range in Excel:\n• Select the cell or range of cells you want to name.\n• Go to the Name box on the left corner of the screen, next to the formula bar.\n• Add the name you want to include and use an underscore instead of spaces.\n\nThen you can create formulas for a specific range of cells by simply using this name.\n\n5. Use outlining to group specific rows and columns\n\nThe outlining feature in Excel allows you to create a hierarchical structure for your dataset. You can hide or display chosen data groups to analyze with greater concentration and accuracy. This is helpful when you have a complex dataset with multiple details and want to zoom into specific sections.\n\nYou can outline your spreadsheets with these steps:\n• Select the row or column you want to group. You must choose an entire row/column or multiple rows/columns.\n• Go to Data > Group > Outline, and you’ll get the option to hide the chosen rows/columns.\n• Click on the plus or minus icon to show and hide your grouped data.\n\nOutlining groups of data makes it easy to navigate a massive spreadsheet and enhances readability. The result? You can quickly work through the data, regardless of size.\n\n💡Do it with Gigasheet: Outlining in Excel feels too much of a hassle? Use the group data feature on Gigasheet to easily categorize data points and hide or view a specific category for accurate, in-depth analysis.\n\nHere’s an example of employee data grouped into three levels: department, age, and job level:\n\nA fairly common way to organize data in Excel is by creating subsheets. You can divide a large workbook into smaller segments and categorize it into different subsheets.\n\nYou can customize each subsheet in multiple ways, such as:\n• Change the sheet’s name and color.\n• Create a copy of a sheet or reorder them.\n• Hide or delete a sheet from the main workbook.\n\nMaking subsheets helps break down a big dataset into smaller, more easily manageable segments and simplifies data processing.\n\n7. Use data consolidation to combine data from multiple sheets\n\nYou can combine data from several spreadsheets into a single sheet using Excel’s data consolidation feature. This is great for analyzing data saved across different sheets or files.\n\nFollow these steps to aggregate data stored in different locations — within the same file or in separate files:\n• Open the sheet where you’d like to consolidate all the data.\n• Use the Browse option to add new files and choose ‘add’ as the reference. You can also use labels in case you’ve added labels in your chosen file.\n• Choose the ‘Create links to source data’ option if you want to update your consolidated data in real time when making changes to the source file.\n\nThe data consolidation feature works well for collecting and organizing data from multiple sources into a single file.\n\nLet’s face it: Excel can be a pain when working with a large file.\n\nInstead of getting caught up in Excel’s slow and frustrating ways, try Gigasheet.\n\nGigasheet is built for large files with multiple options to organize your data seamlessly. You can filter and group data cell ranges, remove duplicates, combine or split columns, and trim whitespace — all in a few clicks.\n\nWith Gigasheet’s AI-powered Sheet Assistant, organizing data in Excel is even easier and quicker. Simply ask the assistant to filter, group, and aggregate your data.\n\nSign up on Gigasheet for free and make data analysis a breeze."

Below is a small sample of the data we are sorting.\n\nWe currently group and sort Paint_Color, Category, and Part Number prefix/suffix manually using formulas, helper columns, and the Sort function in the Data ribbon.\n\nWe’d like to automate this using VBA and expand the sorting functionality to look at each Description, correctly interpret the numerical and dimensional values therein, and sort largest to smallest, progressively from the left most numerical/dimensional value to the right most.\n\nWe had tried adding this to our manually sorting, breaking the description down in a series of helper columns by breaking out the numerical/dimensional values, then separating them using “ X “ as the delimiter. Unfortunately we ran into an issue with Excel seeing our fractional dimensions as dates, and reading our architectural dimensions (which contain a hyphen between the feet and inches) as feet MINUS inches.\n\nThe goal is to automatically group and sort the line items without having to manipulate the data in the cells.\n\nIdeally we’d like to achieve 100% automatic sorting. However, given the irregular nature of our descriptions, we realize some descriptions may get missed or misread.\n\nIn that case, a code which would catch as much as possible, then allow for manual renumbering in the Item column to reposition those items which didn’t take, would be a major help.\n\nIs there a way to handle this, using VBA to break apart and interpret the description within a reasonable shot?"

        "document": "Answer 2 exceeds Stack Overflow’s character limit so I have had to divide it into two.\n\nDo not worry too much about your “sloppy” code. None of were born knowing VBA. Although the basic language is simple, the hundreds of libraries adding functionality are not. Perhaps worse, there are often several approaches to achieving the same effect. For your own code, you can pick your favourite but, if you look at or borrow from other people’s code, you need to be familiar with every approach. It takes lots of practice to become good at VBA and, in my experience, there is always something more to learn.\n\nThis is a completely new answer. Please study the original answer, if you have not done so, because it contains a detailed review of the first part of your code which I believe you will find helpful.\n\nMy major criticism of your code is lack of design. You start by moving table 1 to the destination worksheet which is easy. You then compare every row in table 1 with every row in table 2. Each comparison requires four Ifs. That is four, million, million Ifs before any other code is considered. I have never attempted to time individual VBA statement so I will assume an If takes one millionth of a second although this seems very optimistic. If this assumption is true, merging tables 1 and 2 would take 46 days just for the Ifs. Merging table 1 and 3 would then take another 46 days.\n\nThe first approach I considered was to sort the three tables into one. I quickly abandoned that approach because Excel does not support worksheets with three million rows.\n\nThe next approach I considered was to sort the three tables separately into ascending order. I would then work down the tables looking for the lowest key, move the rows from each table for that key to the destination worksheet and loop looking for the next lowest key. I planned to use Excel’s sort because I thought that would be easier for you to understand. I developed this approach some way before remembering a fatal flaw. The If comparison is strictly Unicode but the Excel sort is not. If your values are strictly alphabetic or strictly numeric, Excel will sort as you might expect. But mix alphabetic and numeric values or include punctuation and the Excel sort becomes eccentric. You can use the Excel sort or you can use If but you cannot use both on the same data.\n\nI have a VBA Quick Sort routine which I use when strict Unicode is required. I will not say more about this routine because I believe it is adequately documented. Switching to my sort routine instead of Excel’s was not difficult but I should have stopped to rethink when my design hit a problem. My routine is limited only by memory and it should be able to sort three million rows. I should have reconsidered my original approach. I have never tried merging three tables and it was much more complicated than merging two. Reverting to approach 1 is one of the alternative ideas I will try.\n\nI hope that is enough background on my approach but come back with questions if necessary.\n\nI dislike routines that say “This may take from a few minutes to several hours” and then go quiet until they finish so I have implemented a progress form. I cannot post a form so you will have to create it yourself. This is my form:\n\nThe exact layout is not important. The form is named “frmProgress” and has a caption “Progress merging tables.” There are four controls which are all labels. This form is strictly for the macro to report progress, there are no input controls. From top to bottom, left to right the controls are “lblMsg”, “lblCountCrnt”, “lblCountOf” and “lblCountMax”. The captions in my form are just to aid form design, they are all overwritten at runtime. The text in “lblCountMax” is left aligned but this is not required. If you have never created a userform, searching for “VBA create userform” brings up lots of tutorials.\n\nIt would be possible to include all the code below in a single module. However, I prefer to divide my code so there is one module per purpose.\n\nOver the years I have created standard subroutines and functions that perform tasks I need again and again. I use Excel’s Personal workbook as a library so they are accessible from every one of my workbooks.\n\nThis module I name “LibOffice” and it contains routines useful across Office:\n\nThis module I name “LibExcel” and contains routines useful for Excel:"

        "document": "Excel already has a couple of ways to sort data quickly.\n\nYou can easily sort a data set by using the sort icons in the ribbon or the sort dialog box.\n\nThen why do you need to know how to do this using VBA?\n\nKnowing how to sort data using VBA can be helpful when included as a part of your code. For example, suppose you get a data set daily/weekly that you need to format and sort in a specific order.\n\nYou can create a macro to do all this for you with a single click. That will save you a lot of time and effort every time you do it.\n\nAlso, if you create Excel dashboards, you can take Excel sorting capability to a new level by allowing the user to sort the data just by double-clicking on the header (as shown below).\n\nI will cover how to create this later in this tutorial. Let’s first quickly get the basics straight.\n\nWhen sorting using VBA, you need to use the Range.Sort method in your code.\n\nThe ‘Range’ would be the data that you’re trying to sort. For example, if you’re sorting the data in A1:A10, then ‘Range’ would be Range(“A1:A10”).\n\nYou can also create a named range and use it instead of the cell references. For example, if I create a named range ‘DataRange’ for the cells A1:A10, then I can also use Range(“DataRange”)\n\nWith the sort method, you need to provide some additional information through parameters. Below are the key parameters you need to know:\n• Key – here you need to specify the column that you want to sort. For example, if you want to sort column A, you need to use key:=Range(“A1”)\n• Order – here you specify whether you want the sorting in an ascending order or the descending order. For example, if you want the sorting in ascending order, you will use Order:=xlAscending\n• Header – here you specify whether your data set has headers or not. If it has headers, the sorting starts from the second row of the data set, else it starts from the first row. To specify that your data has headers, you will use Header:=xlYes\n\nWhile these three suffices in most of the cases, you can read more about the parameters in this article.\n\nNow let’s see how to use the Range.Sort method in VBA to sort data in Excel.\n\nSuppose you have a single column without header (as shown below).\n\nYou can use the below code to sort it in ascending order.\n\nNote that I have specified the data range manually as Range(“A1:A12”).\n\nIn case there might be changes in the data and values might be added/deleted, you can use the below code that automatically adjusts based on the filled cells in the dataset.\n\nNote that instead of Range(“A1:A12”), I have used, Range(“A1”, Range(“A1”).End(xlDown)).\n\nThis will check the last consecutively filled cell in the column and include it in sorting. In case there are blanks, it will only consider data till the first blank cell.\n\nYou can also create a named range and use that named range instead of the cell references. For example, if the named range is DataSet, your code would now be as shown below.\n\nNow let me quickly explain the parameters used in the above examples:\n• Key1:=Range(“A1”) – Specified A1 so that the code would know which column to sort.\n• Order1:=xlAscending – Specified the order as xlAscending. If you want it to be in the descending order, use xlDescending.\n• Header:= xlNo – Specified that there are no headers. This is also the default value. So even if you omit this, your data will be sorted considering it has no headers.\n\nWondering where to put this VBA code and how to run the macro? Read this tutorial!\n\nIn the previous example, the data set did not have a header.\n\nWhen your data has headers, you need to specify that in the code so that the sorting can start from the second row of the dataset.\n\nSuppose you have a dataset as shown below:\n\nBelow is the code that will sort the data in descending order based on the sales of the stores.\n\nNote that I have created a named range – ‘DataRange’, and used this named range in the code.\n\nSo far in this tutorial, we have seen how to sort a single column (with and without headers).\n\nNow, what if you want to sort based on multiple columns.\n\nFor example, in the below data set, what if I want to first sort by the state code, and then by the store.\n\nHere is the code that will sort multiple columns at one go.\n\nBelow is the result that you will get.\n\nIn the above example, the data is first sorted by the state code (column A). Then within the state code data, it is again sorted by the Store (Column B). This order is determined by the code in which you mention it.\n\nIf you’re creating a dashboard or want more ease of use in your reports, you can write a VBA code that will sort the data when you double click on the headers.\n\nSomething as shown below:\n\nBelow is the code that will allow you to do this:\n\nNote that I have created a named range (“DataRange”) and have used it in the code instead of using the cell references.\n\nAs soon as you double-click on any of the headers, the code disables the usual double-click functionality (which is to get into the edit mode) and uses that cell as the key while sorting the data.\n\nAlso note that as of now, this code will sort all the columns in ascending order only.\n\nWhere to put this code?\n\nYou need to paste this code into the code window of the sheet in which you want this double click sort functionality.\n\nTo do this:\n• Paste the code in the code window of the sheet in which your data resides.\n\nNow what if you want to sort the first two columns (‘State’ and ‘Store’) in ascending order, but ‘Sales’ column in descending order.\n\nHere is the code that will do it:\n\nIn the above code, it checks if the cell that is double-clicked is the Sales header or not. If yes, then it assigns the xlDescending value to the variable SortOrder, else it makes it xlAscending.\n\nNow let’s take this a notch further and show a visual Marker (arrow and colored cell) in the header when it is sorted.\n\nSomething as shown below:\n\nTo get this, I have added a new worksheet and made the following changes in it (you can download the example file and follow along):\n• Changed the name of the new sheet to ‘BackEnd’.\n• In cell B2, entered an arrow symbol (to do this, go to Insert and click on ‘Symbol’ option).\n• Copy and paste the headers from the data set to cell A3:C3 in the ‘Backend’ sheet.\n• Use the following function in cell A4:AC4:\n• Rest of the cells will automatically get filled by the VBA code when you double click on the headers to sort the column.\n\nYour backend sheet would look something as shown below:\n\nNow you can use the below code to sort the data by double-clicking on the headers. When you double-click on a header, it will automatically get the arrow in the header text. Note that I have also used conditional formatting to highlight the cell as well.\n\nNote that this code works well for the way my data and workbook is constructed. If you change the structure of the data, you will have to modify the code accordingly.\n\nYou May Also Like the Following Excel Tutorials:\n• How to Filter Data in a Pivot Table in Excel.\n• How to do a Multi-level Data Sorting in Excel.\n• How to Use Excel VBA InStr Function (with practical EXAMPLES)."
