        "document": "With a growing number of underlying model options for OpenAI's ChatGPT, choosing the right one is a necessary first step for any AI project. Knowing the differences between GPT-3, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 is essential when purchasing SaaS-based generative AI tools.\n\nGPT-3.5, the refined version of GPT-3 rolled out in November 2022, is currently offered in ChatGPT's free web app version and its premium Turbo API versions. GPT-4, released in March 2023, provides an even more advanced GPT choice for workplace tasks and comes with its own Turbo version. Turbo versions represent incremental improvements, such as lower latency and minor bug fixes.\n\nChoosing between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 means parsing out the differences in their respective features. By breaking down the two models' key differences in capabilities, accuracy and pricing, organizations can decide which OpenAI GPT model is right for them.\n\nIn November 2023, OpenAI debuted GPT-4 Turbo, along with a GPT-4 Turbo with Vision model, with a larger context window and significantly cheaper pricing. Its 128,000-token context window -- equivalent to sending approximately 300 pages of text in a single prompt -- offers enhanced accuracy, speed and versatility. It's also three times cheaper for input tokens and two times more affordable for output tokens than GPT-4, which has a maximum of 4,096 output tokens. Rate limits on how often the model can be used within a specified period of time are available in the rate limits guide.\n\nOn May 13, 2024, OpenAI released the more powerful, cost-effective and faster GPT-4o. This was followed by the release of GPT-4o mini, a scaled-back and cheaper version of GPT-4o. A growing number of clues indicate that OpenAI will release a GPT-5.0 version sometime in 2025. OpenAI's original goal was to produce a large language model (LLM) with artificial general intelligence that passes the Turing test. Researchers claim generative models have long passed the human intelligence threshold. Indeed, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman aspires to create software bots with artificial superintelligence that outperform humans."
