        "document": "This page explains how to use the PuTTY terminal window on Windows. How to configure PuTTY, how to create and save profiles, and what configuration options to change. Advanced topics, such as configuring public key authentication, are also addressed.\n\nYou can download a copy of the software for the Windows platform from the download page. Detailed installation instructions are provided on the installation instructions page.\n\nIf you selected to create a desktop icon during installation, you can start the software simply by (double-)clicking on the icon. Otherwise, open the software from the Windows Start menu.\n\nWhen the software starts, a window titled PuTTY Configuration should open. This window has a configuration pane on the left, a Host Name (or IP address) field and other options in the middle, and a pane for saving session profiles in the lower right area.\n\nFor simple use, all you need to do is to enter the domain name or IP address of the host you want to connect to in the Host Name field and click Open (or press Enter). A domain name looks like . An IP address looks something like .\n\nWhat if you don't have a server\n\nIf you don't have a server to connect to, you can try Tectia SSH on Windows or OpenSSH on Linux.\n\nWhen you connect to a server for the first time, you are likely to see a dialog about the server's host key not being cached in the registry. This is normal when you are connecting to a server for the first time. If you ever get this with a server, it could mean that someone is trying to attack your connection and steal your password using a man-in-the-middle attack.\n\nBut as said, the first time you connect, this is normal, and you should just click Yes. If you want to be fancy, you can check the displayed key fingerprint and make sure it is the same that is used by the server. In real life, almost nobody does that. It is more secure to use a proper SSH key management solution anyway.\n\nAfter the security alert, you should get a terminal window. By default, this is a black, very bland window. It should first ask for your user name and then password. After these, you should get a command line on the server.\n\nYou can then type into the terminal Window. You are now connected to the server, and anything you type in the Window is sent to the server. Server's responses are displayed in the Window. You can run any text-based applications on the server using the window. The session terminates when you exit the command-line shell on the server (typically by typing ) to the command line or pressing . Alternatively, you can forcibly terminate the session by closing the terminal window.\n\nThe initial configuration window contains a lot of options. Most of them are not needed in normal use.\n\nThe port field specifies the TCP/IP port to connect. For SSH, this is the port on which the SSH server runs. Normally it can be left to 22. If for some reason you need to connect to a different port number, just change the value. Usually only developers would change this to a different value, but some enterprises are known to run SSH servers in non-standard ports or to run multiple SSH servers on the same server at different ports.\n\nThe Connection type selection almost never needs to be touched. Just leave it as SSH. SSH is a secure, encrypted communications protocol designed to ensure your password and data are maximally protected.\n\nRaw connections might be used for developers to connect a TCP/IP socket for testing (e.g., when developing a network application that listens on a TCP/IP port).\n\nTelnet is an old legacy protocol that is almost never used, unless you manage equipment that is more than 10 years old. Telnet is not secure. Passwords are sent in the clear on the network. Attackers can easily eavesdrop on plaintext communications and steal user names and passwords. Rlogin is another legacy protocol with similar woes.\n\nSerial refers to a serial port, another legacy communications mechanism for connecting computers to peripheral devices. Most PCs these days no longer have serial ports, but they are still sometimes used for controlling physical equipment, instrumentation, machinery, or communications devices. Another use for serial ports is debugging operating systems or embedded software.\n\nThis section allows you to save your settings as named profiles. Just write the name of your new profile in the Saved Sessions box and click Save to create a new profile. The host name and your other settings are saved in the profile.\n\nSaved profiles appear in the larger box below it. Initially it will contain just Default Settings. Profiles you save will be included there. Select a profile and click Load to use a previously saved profile. Select a profile and click Delete to delete a profile that is no longer needed.\n\nFinally, the Close window on exit setting specifies whether the terminal window should be automatically closed when the connection is terminated. There is rarely any need to change it from the default value of Only on clean exit.\n\nMore options can be found in the left pane titled Category. Select a category from the tree, and the right pane will change to show configuration options for that category. The initally shown options belong to the Session category.\n\nOnly the more relevant options are described here. There are lots of options, and most of them would never be used.\n\nThe options in this category influence terminal emulation and keyboard mappings. They are largely self-explanatory, and will not be covered here. Very few people need to touch these. Some people may change how the bell character is handled; people using exotic operating systems might change what is sent by the backspace or delete character.\n\nThe window options influence the appearance and behavior of the terminal window. It can also specify how characters are translated on output and to select fonts and colors for the window.\n\nOf the connection options, the Data options can be useful. The Auto-login user name specifies the user to log in as, so that the name will not have to be entered every time. The Proxy options are rarely useful for home users, but may be needed in enterprises that do not allow outgoing Internet connections without using a SOCKS proxy or other similar mechanisms. Don't worry if you don't know what a SOCKS proxy is; just stay out of that section.\n\nThe Telnet, Rlogin, and Serial categories only contain options for those protocols, and very few people would ever use them.\n\nThe SSH options, however, are important and useful for some people. The ordinary user or student need not worry about them. But if you want to use public key authentication, then they are needed. Note that you need to open the SSH options subtree by clicking on the small symbol. Otherwise you won't see all the options.\n\nYou almost never want to touch the Kex (key exchange), Host Keys, or Cipher options. They all have reasonable default values, and most people don't know enough about cryptography to select any better values. Thus just skip these options, unless you know what you are doing.\n\nThe Auth subtree contains some options that may be useful. When Auth is clicked, it shows a pane titled Options controlling SSH authentication. To enable public key authentication, you just generate an SSH key and then click the Browse button in the Authentication parameters box in the middle right area of this configuration pane. For more information, see also configuring public key authentication for PuTTY. Advanced users may also want to check the Allow agent forwarding checkbox to use key-based single sign-on.\n\nMost users have no need to generate SSH keys and need not know what public key authentication is. System administrators, however, should learn it and should also familiarize themselves with SSH key management and ensure their organization implements proper provisioning and termination processes and audits for SSH keys.\n\nOne of the interesting features of PuTTY is support for Active Directory single sign-on. Technically it uses the Kerberos protocol via a programming interface called GSSAPI. In the SSH protocol, the mechanism is called GSSAPI authentication. Enterprise users using Kerberos authentication (e.g., via the Centrify or Quest Authentication Services aka Vintela) may want to take advantage of the single-sign-on capability. Other users don't need to care. The settings for GSSAPI authentication can be found under the SSH / Auth section. Note that you must again expand the Auth section by clicking on the symbol to see the GSSAPI options.\n\nX11 is a protocol and system for running graphical applications on Unix and Linux. It supports running graphical applications remotely over a network out-of-the-box.\n\nPuTTY does not implement an X11 server (the display side), but it can work with some other product that implements X server functionality on Windows. A popular free alternative is XMing.\n\nTo use an X11 server, you need to check the Enable X11 forwarding box and enter localhost:0.0 in the X display location box. The other settings need not be touched. Detailed instructions can be found, e.g., here.\n\nThe final category of configuration options we'll discuss is Tunnels. They are used for configuring SSH tunneling, also called SSH port forwarding. This panel can be used for defining forwardings for the connection. Forwardings are saved in the profile.\n\nTo add a local forwarding (i.e., TCP/IP port on local machine forwarded to a port on the remote machine or to a machine reachable from the remote machine), write the source port in the Source port field, the destination host and port (e.g., ) in the Destination field, and select Local. The click Add.\n\nTo add a remote forwarding (i.e., a TCP/IP port on the remote machine forwarded to a port on the local machine or to a machine reachable from the local machine), specify Source port on the destination machine and Destination that is reachable from the local machine (your desktop).\n\nNormally you need not check Local ports accept connections from other hosts or the same for remote ports. However, if the connection to the forwarded port is from a over a network instead of from , then you need to check these. There is a small security risk, but usually it is not a problem in the cases where SSH tunneling is used. However you should understand that anyone who can connect to the respective computer can then connect to the forwarded port. In some cases port forwarding can be used to traverse firewalls. We suggest you read our article on the risks of SSH port forwarding."

Below are instructions for setting up a PuTTY SSH connection for the first time on a Microsoft Windows PC using the free PuTTY SSH client. Note that you can also create a new SSH private key file at any time.\n\nThe process of setting up a PuTTY connection consists of the following steps:\n• Converting the Downloaded Sierra Private Key File to the PuTTY Private Key File Format\n\nYou can download the PuTTY software tools from the PuTTY website in 32-bit or 64-bit Windows versions. The PuTTY programs are small, self-contained executable files that do not need to be permanently installed by Windows or saved in a specific Windows directory.\n\nTo set up a PuTTY SSH connection to Admin Corner, you must download the following:\n• The PuTTYgen utility (puttygen.exe), which is used for converting the Sierra private key file into PuTTY's own private key file format\n\nYou can download a private key file for SSH key authentication from the Sierra Administration Application. To download the private key file, do the following:\n• Click and save the key file to your local PC.\n\nConverting the Downloaded Sierra Private Key File to the PuTTY Private Key File Format\n\nPuTTY stores SSH private key files in the .ppk file format. To convert the OpenSSH private key file provided by the Sierra Administrative Application into a .ppk file, do the following:\n• Click the button to load an existing private key file.\n• In the Load Private Key dialog box that opens, locate the drop-down selector in the lower-right corner that provides file search options. Change the selection to \"All Files (*)\", and navigate to the directory containing the private key file downloaded in the previous section. Click .\n• Click OK when prompted with the message \"Successfully imported foreign key ....To use this key with PuTTY, you need to use the 'Save private key' command.\"\n• Confirm that \"RSA\" is selected. You can find this option on PuTTYgen's main window at the bottom in the Parameters: Type of key to generate section. For the Number of bits in a generated key value, use the default of \"2048\".\n• Click Yes when PuTTYgen displays a warning window with the question \"Are you sure you want to save this key without a passphrase to protect it?\".\n• From the Save private key as dialog box, select the name of the PuTTY private key file, the file storage location, and the file type. Use the file type \"PuTTY Private Key Files (*.ppk)\" when saving the PuTTY private key.\n\nYou can save for future use your Admin Corner PuTTY configuration settings. To save your configuration, do the following:\n• Configure the settings on the Session panel.\n• Click the Session option in the Category pane on the left-hand side of the screen.\n• In the Host Name (or IP address) field, type your Sierra app server host name or IP address.\n• Configure the settings on the Data panel.\n• Click the Connection | Data option in the Category pane on the left-hand side of the screen.\n• In the Auto-login username field, type \"sadmin\" with no quotation marks.\n• Configure the settings on the Auth panel.\n• Click the Connection | SSH | Auth option in the Category pane on the left-hand side of the screen.\n• Click the Browse button under the text \"Private Key file for authentication\".\n• Navigate to the directory where you saved the PuTTY-generated private key file (*.ppk). Select the file and click Open.\n• Save your session configuration for Sierra Admin Corner on the Session panel.\n• Click the Session option in the Category pane on the left-hand side of the screen.\n• In the blank field under the text Saved Sessions, enter a name for your Sierra Admin Corner session.\n\nTo access Sierra Admin Corner with your saved PuTTY session, do the following:\n• Click to highlight the saved Sierra Admin Corner session name."

        "document": "Running multiple OSes is a common reality in today's business environments. Take workstations and servers, for example. A Windows workstation might need to connect to Linux servers, IoT systems and network devices. The challenge faced, however, is connecting these environments securely and keeping data protected.\n\nPuTTY is one tool that can help with this.\n\nWhat is SSH? What is PuTTY? SSH is a networking protocol that enables secure access to a computer or device over an unsecure network. Many Linux servers and network devices accept inbound SSH connections for remote configuration. Sysadmins use SSH to connect to remote devices and do the following:\n• Connect to network devices, such as routers and managed switches to do the following: PuTTY is an open source GUI implementation of the Secure Shell protocol that has long been used to run secure SSH tunnels to and from Windows computers. Initially released in 1999, PuTTY grew in popularity because Windows did not include the OpenSSH command line client and server until Windows 10 and later. PuTTY remains a viable alternative to OpenSSH today because its GUI might be easier for admins to customize. Managing multiple SSH profiles is also simpler in PuTTY, as are other customizations, such as selecting encryption keys.\n\nPuTTY can be downloaded here. Follow these steps to install it:\n• Select the appropriate package file and download the installation executable. Supported Windows systems include 64-bit x86, 64-bit Arm and 32-bit x86. The general PuTTY installation includes all protocol client types. Downloadable clients that support a single protocol, such as Telnet, SCP and SFTP, are also available.\n• Run the installer when the download completes. Double-click the installer to run the program.\n• When the file has downloaded, double-click on the MSI package to launch the installer.\n• Select Next on the Welcome page.\n• Choose the destination location. The default is C:\\Program Files\\PuTTY\\. Click Next.\n• On the Products Features page, browse and select any additional nondefault options if desired. Click Install.\n• If the Windows User Account Control asks to allow the app to make changes on your computer, select Yes. Once complete, you can view the README file for basic guidance or exit. PuTTY is ready for use.\n\nHow to use PuTTY for a basic connection Assume the targeted Linux system is configured for inbound SSH connections with no special settings. For example, root is allowed over SSH, the firewall permits TCP port 22, default password-based authentication is set, etc. Launch PuTTY on a Windows workstation and type the destination IP address in the HOST Name (or IP address) box. Ensure SSH is selected from the Connection type radio options. Click Open. The remote Linux system will prompt you for the name and password of a local user account. A new window will open and display your SSH session. The first time you establish a connection, you will receive a PuTTY Security Alert informing you the remote server's host key is not cached. It's verifying the destination server is the device you believe it is. Click Accept if you're confident of the identity of the remote system. Saving connection specifications lets you quickly connect to frequently accessed remote servers. Type the remote system's hostname or IP address, select the Saved Sessions box, and enter a name for the connection. You can use whatever descriptive name you want. Select Save, and the session name appears in the box. This can be done for multiple destinations. Select one and click Open to connect to it. If you connect to many servers via PuTTY and must manage their keys, consider using Pageant, PuTTY's authentication agent application.\n\nKey-based authentication is strongly recommended. It's a common requirement on Linux certification exams, a standard step in enterprise Linux configurations, and an industry best practice. Key-based authentication also makes automated tasks via scripting and Ansible easier. Follow these three steps to configure key-based authentication in PuTTY: PuTTY includes an application called PuTTYgen to create key pairs. Do the following on the Windows SSH client that will connect to the remote Linux SSH server:\n• Run the PuTTY key generation tool from C:\\Program Files\\PuTTY\\puttygen or using the command from the command line.\n• Select Generate in the PuTTY Key Generator window. Move the mouse to create the random values used to develop the key.\n• Select specific key types and bit lengths. Options include RSA, Digital Signature Algorithm, Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm and more. Copy the public key and paste it into the authorized_keys file.\n• Select the entire contents of the \"Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys file\" from the Key window. This is the public key. Copy it to the clipboard to paste into a file later. Select Yes on the passphrase PuTTYgen Warning window\n• Select Save private key. Select Yes in the PuTTYgen Warning window regarding passphrases. 2. Copy the public key to the remote device On the Linux server, accessed from the local Windows client, do the following:\n• Connect to the remote Linux server via a standard password-protected SSH/PuTTY session and log in.\n• Use the command to create a directory named ~/.ssh.\n• Enter the command . This gives users (owners) read, write and execute permissions.\n• Use the command to create an empty text file named authorized_keys.\n• Paste the contents of the \"Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys file\" into the text file. Confirm you have pasted the key. Save and close the file.\n• Enter the command . This setting provides the user with read and write permissions on the authorized_keys file. Use the main PuTTY application to configure the PuTTY client to use key-based authentication.\n• Launch PuTTY but do not connect to a remote system.\n• In the Category window, browse to Connection>Data.\n• Set the Auto-login username to the remote SSH username. This is the user for whom you created the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the remote Linux system.\n• Browse to Connection>SSH>Auth. Select Browse. Find the saved private key created with the PuTTYgen application."

        "document": "PuTTY and Secure Shell (SSH) Best Practices are almost the opposite ends of a very wide dichotomy, but to keep your organization’s data secure, it’s important to consider both ends of the spectrum. We’ll get to those SSH best practices in a second (as well as what could happen if your organization lacks an effective management strategy). For now, though, let’s talk about PuTTY. First, some background. If you’re going to get involved in DevOps and cloud, you might start off on a Windows desktop, or laptop or virtual machine and get halfway decent with maybe some Visual Basic scripting, maybe some PowerShell, but probably don't have any experience in the world of Unix and Linux. Most likely, you’ve heard about what Unix and Linux can do. And there's probably some limitations in what you can do in the Windows world that entices you to want to learn more about Unix and Linux. In order to get access to that Unix/Linux world, you need to be able to authenticate and log in to a Unix/Linux system, much in the same way that one might use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), to gain access to a different Windows system. Where you'll have an RDP client like Terminal Services to gain access to different Windows Servers, you need to an SSH client to gain access to a Unix or Linux server. And the most popular and SSH client for Windows is PuTTY. It's been around forever. Once you download and run PuTTY on your Windows system, you connect on port 22 to gain access and authenticate to a Unix or Linux system. That system could be a big physical IBM server in a data center, a virtual machine that is running within VMware, or a VMWare ESX cluster itself, or even something that's in the Cloud- an Amazon EC2 instance or a Docker Container or a Kubernetes Control Plane. Regardless of what UNIX/Linux server you’re connecting to, if your source Operating System is Windows, PuTTY is probably going to be your remote access client to gain access to that Unix/Linux system. When you first login using PuTTY to the Unix/Linux system, you'll probably be asked for a Username and Password which you’ll have been provided by your Identity and Access Management team or some other Administrator. Once logged in, you’ll be using a text-based interface to navigate UNIX/Linux instead of a Graphical User Interface like what you’re used to in Windows. The text-based interface is a command prompt that is very roughly similar to a PowerShell or Windows command prompt. However, your interactions with that prompt now use an entirely different set of commands and even technical philosophy (See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy). Table 2: Sample comparison between commands used in Windows vs. Unix/Linux There's a million other types of commands that go with Unix and Linux as well. But all of these keystrokes, all the input and output is flowing over a Secure Shell, SSH protocol that is established between the Windows PuTTY SSH client and whatever that SSH server is.\n\nWhen you first connect from the Windows PuTTY (or any) SSH client to an SSH server, you're provided a fingerprint, which is a representation of the server’s Machine Identity. This Machine Identity is the Server’s SSH Host Key—a public/private keypair, similar in some ways to an SSL/TLS Certificate. You’re provided a choice—are you connected to the right Server? Unfortunately, the fingerprint is not human-readable, and so 99% of the time you’ll probably assume it is correct. Once you say “Yes”, that SSH Host Key—that machine identity—is stored by PuTTY on your Windows system. You'll not be asked about it again unless somehow that key should change. In that instance, you’ll be warned that an active Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack could be occurring. There's all sorts of different logs that are retained by the SSH Server—every time somebody (or some other machine) attempts to connect to the SSH server. Very often, one machine automatically connects to another machine using SSH. Anytime you have that automation, anytime that you have commands run, anytime you have authentication completed, the SSH server can be configured to keep logs of this activity. There are authentication logs, there are command logs, there are logs that go with file access. You can get down to a very granular detail in the logs that are kept on an SSH server. In some instances, there are so many SSH logs that they'll fill up the entire file system on that SSH server. So if you're administering an SSH server, you need to be mindful of that. You'll want to do some sort of automation there to make sure that those logs are pruned and not just kept open especially if you have a busy server. For example, maybe you're trying to set up a Kubernetes service. You use PuTTY to SSH into the Kubernetes Control Plane. YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) files may be downloaded, edited, and executed to deploy things like Container and Application Services. Given that this Control Plane has the capability to make or break your business, it should be carefully audited and access should be restricted. Instead of using a Username/Password, an alternate authentication method to a UNIX/Linux server is using an SSH User Key. While in some ways similar to a password, SSH User Keys enable automated access to an SSH Server. These keys are often used by CI/CD pipelines and with concepts like Infrastructure as Code. If you have interactive access to a Unix or Linux shell, then there's a high probability that that operating system instance of Linux or Unix can be compromised. Somebody might run the wrong command and exhaust the CPU, Memory, or Disk resources on that system. SSH keys must be carefully managed, as a lack of SSH key management (including visibility and policy control) can create significant vulnerabilities. For instance, an April 2024 PuTTY vulnerability, discovered by researchers at Ruhr University Bochum, enables threat actors to recover NIST P-521 keys, due to the way PuTTY generates ECDSA nonces (single-use random numbers) for SSH authentication. Specifically, this vulnerability allows threat actors with knowledge of related public keys, as well as ~60 cryptographic signatures, to derive the private key, which could result in access to SSH servers or code commits. This unauthorized access, in turn, could lead to a software supply chain attack. If you’re interested in using PuTTY, let me welcome you to the world of UNIX and Linux! There’s lots to learn and there is an amazing community of people available to help you every step of the way. If you’re an experienced software developer, I hope you’ve found this basic introduction to SSH Keys to be helpful as you iterate through your next sprint!"

        "document": "If configurations or unanticipated software vulnerabilities exist, leaving the SSH port open and unrestricted may allow incursions for public instances. Use these best practices to assist prevent intrusions:\n\nRestrict your security group to allow incoming connections to port 22 from trusted IPs only, such as corporate network Ips.\n\nTypically, to connect to a remote instance in AWS, you enter your username and password into a client like Telnet or Putty. Using a password that is too long every time you want to start a session is annoying and insecure.\n\nYou can increase security by using keypairs, which are made up of a public key and a private key. Your private key is kept secret and your public key is kept on the host you want to connect to. These keys can be used in saved sessions and are encrypted. When you log in remotely to the host, it assists you in using your private key and establishes a connection without requesting a password.\n\nIt’s still safer to store a private key than storing a password, as the private key is encrypted.\n\nThis blog demonstrates how to switch over to key-based SSH authentication, which is more secure because it allows only the key’s owner to log in. In this illustration, we’re using a Windows PC and PuTTY as our SSH client.\n\n2 Generate a private and public key pair using puttygen (its get’s installed, when you install putty)\n\n\n\n Open PuTTYgen , press Generate button, and keep moving the mouse, till the time keys are generated. Once the keys are generated, type your key passphrase (choose a “hard to guess” one. This is optional. You can continue without providing the passphrase). Save the Public key. Save the Private key.\n\nFor this guide let’s assume your regular login name is test (replace it with one that you use regularly).\n\nAs root, on the shell, type:\n\nYou will be asked to fill in some details such as the user’s real name (empty string is fine).\n\nThen in that folder, create and edit a file called authorized_keys. With below commands\n\nIn there, cut/paste your public ssh key, on ONE LINE (That is very important!!!). After you paste the key, save the file by pressing ESC key once on keyboard and typing :wq at the prompt \n\n \n\n Note:\n• at the end of the line. \n\n\n\nThe entry in the file should look similar to the one shown below \n\n\n\nNow change the permission (in the earlier step we gave 700 file permission to the ssh directory, thus all the files and folders inside this directory will have this permission ) to the authorized keys file by typing the below command at the prompt\n\n\n\n Start the PuTTY SSH authentication agent PAGEANT.EXE. (it get’s installed with Putty)\n\nOnce paegant is started, you will find it in the system tray. right-click its syspanel icon and select “add key”. Select your private key file, and type in your passphrase (if you have given it) when you add the key. The Pageant works as a passphrase keeper.\n\n5. Use PuTTY to connect to your server\n\nOpen PuTTY and connect as test@ IP_address (IP address of the EC2 instance) to connect. For demo, I have given the IP address as 1.2.3.4.\n\nClick on open, and see you log in without a password.\n\nUseCases when the above method can be helpful\n• None If a user in your organization requires access to the system by using a separate key pair, you can generate a new keypair and copy the public key in the file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\n• None If someone has a copy of the private key (.pem file) and you want to prevent them from connecting to your instance (for example, if they’ve left your organization), you can delete the public key on the instance and replace it with a new one.\n• None If you create a Linux AMI from an instance, the public key material is copied from the instance to the AMI. If you launch an instance from the AMI, the new instance includes the public key from the original instance. To prevent someone who has the private key from connecting to the new instance, you can remove the public key from the original instance before creating the AMI.\n\n\n\n To add or replace a key pair, you must be able to connect to your instance. If you’ve lost your existing private key or you launched your instance without a key pair, you won’t be able to connect to your instance and therefore won’t be able to add or replace a key pair. If you’ve lost your private key, you might be able to retrieve it. If you launched your instance without a key pair, you won’t be able to connect to the instance unless you chose an AMI that is configured to allow users another way to log in.\n• None Create a new key pair using the Amazon EC2 console or a third-party tool (Putty).\n• None Retrieve the public key from your new key pair.\n• None Using a text editor of your choice, open the .ssh/authorized_keys file on the instance. Paste the public key information from your new key pair underneath the existing public key information. Save the file.\n• None Disconnect from your instance, and test that you can connect to your instance using the new private key fileDisconnect .\n• None If you’re replacing an existing key pair, connect to your instance and delete the public key information for the original key pair from the .ssh/authorized_keys file.\n\nFor more software engineering related blogs, follow here."

        "document": "In my last blog, I talked a bit about where SSH (Secure Shell) is used and provided an overview of the basic components of SSH and how they operate. As I discussed before, SSH is a powerful security tool, protecting privileged access to mission critical systems. However, when it is not properly managed, it can become a security liability instead of asset. My goal is to help you understand the underlying challenges of securing SSH. In this blog, I’ll summarize some of the risks related to SSH, so when we move on to talking about best practices in my next blog entry, you’ll know why they’re needed.\n\nSecure Shell (SSH) is a network protocol that establishes a cryptographically secure connection between two parties. As such, it plays a crucial role in protecting information those parties exchange. But the network protocol isn't foolproof.\n\nUnlike other security tools, SSH machine identities generally aren’t centrally managed. Instead, SSH is most often managed by individual administrators for the servers they control. Consequently, most organizations don’t have a central view or one way of controlling the configuration of SSH or the access it provides. Because of this lack of central oversight, administrators are left to their own devices, which results in significant security risks.\n\nIf organizations mismanage their SSH keys, they could expose themselves to significant digital security risks. That's especially the case if they have lots of untracked persistent SSH trust relationships in their encryption environments.\n\nThe diagram below provides a summary of SSH security risks. As you can see, the risks span the SSH server and client, with most arising on the server-side.\n\nYou need to be particularly careful when activating an SSH server because these types of assets enable remote login. Attackers could abuse this facet in a poorly controlled SSH environment using free implementations like OpenSSH to surreptitiously enable SSH on critical assets. With SSH set up, attackers could then gain remote access to an asset and thereafter do whatever they want with it. If you have users and administrators enabling SSH server access on systems where it isn’t required, you’re expanding your attack surface because attackers will have a greater possibility of remotely gaining access to those systems.\n\nFor the systems where SSH use is justified, if SSH server and client software is not kept up to date with fixes and updates, it can expose the systems and data it is designed to protect and make them vulnerable to compromise.\n\nMost SSH server and client implementations (e.g., OpenSSH) include a significant number of configuration parameters which impact operation and security, including options for authentication, root access, port forwarding, file locations, etc. Fortunately, over the years, most SSH implementation developers have selected default configurations that are more secure. However, there are a couple of defaults, such as port forwarding and the location of authorized key files, that are not optimal. In addition, if your users and administrators arbitrarily change those configurations without considering the security implications, they can open those systems to broader attacks.\n\nDating back to the days where encryption wasn’t available for all protocols, SSH features the ability to forward traffic sent to a local port on an SSH client. The traffic is forwarded through the encrypted SSH session to the SSH server or even beyond. The challenge is that this provides the ability for unapproved communications to traverse firewalls. If the user of an SSH client that has been granted SSH access to a server on the other side of a firewall is allowed to enable local port forwarding, they open the possibility that an attacker can gain access to systems and devices which might otherwise not be accessible. By exploiting port forwarding, an attacker may bypass firewalls that have been setup to limit access to the server’s network. In addition, attackers avoid detection because they are operating over an encrypted SSH connection.\n\nWhen you configure SSH for public key authentication, private keys then enable access to accounts. If a private key gets compromised, an attacker can authenticate into the account(s) where the private key is trusted. Here are some of the risks posed to SSH private keys:\n• Careless Users: When users are authorized to use SSH public key authentication, they can be careless in their handling of their private keys, either placing them in insecure locations, copying them to multiple computers, and not protecting them with strong passwords.\n• Administrator Turnover: When public key authentication is used for automated processes, one or more administrators for the process will be responsible for managing the process’ private key. Administrators can make copies of those private keys and, if they’re reassigned or terminated, can use the key(s) to authenticate to the target servers.\n• Weak Keys: Because many SSH keys have not been changed in years, smaller length keys (e.g., 512 or 768-bit keys) are still in use, making it possible for a sophisticated attacker to derive the value of the private key. In addition, there have been bugs in cryptographic libraries (e.g., Debian in 2006) that have resulted in weak, easily breakable keys being generated.\n\nBecause SSH provides remote access into systems, it is critical that access be tracked and controlled. Since many organizations don’t have centralized oversight and control of SSH, the risk of unauthorized access is increasing. Here are a few of these risks:\n• Untracked Trust Relationships: Just as with any access method, not keeping an inventory of where SSH keys are installed and the trust relationships they establish between systems and accounts is a recipe for unauthorized access. With administrators coming and going over time, many organizations have accumulated large numbers of SSH keys but do not have visibility into the access they provide.\n• Terminated Employees: If SSH users—whether employees or outside contractors—change roles or are terminated and their access to SSH servers is not properly updated or terminated, these individuals can have ongoing (yet unauthorized) access to mission critical systems.\n• Backdoor Keys: By default, most SSH implementations (e.g., OpenSSH) allow users to configure their own authorized key files (placing a public key in an account so they can access it using a private key). If organizations don’t keep an up to date inventory of authorized keys and regularly review it, users or even attackers may place authorized keys in unexpected places for future access.\n\nSSH is generally integrated with other components to enable access (e.g., operating system permissions, sudo, PAM, identity management, etc.). It is difficult enough to centrally orchestrate the secure configuration of all these components to prevent an attacker from successfully escalating privileges during an attack. It’s even more challenging when you have multiple individual administrators each making decisions on the implementation of SSH without any central oversight or review. Without this oversight, you’ll face greater potential for privilege escalation, especially since attackers remotely accessing systems over SSH have an encrypted session within which to hide their actions.\n\nIf a user or administrator who initially establishes a connection from an SSH client to an SSH server does not check the authenticity of the public key for that server, they may accept an attacker’s public key and enable a man-in-the-middle attack.\n\nOnce attackers gain an initial entry into a network (either via phishing or some other means), their next goal is typically to get onto other systems. If not tightly controlled and managed, SSH can enable that movement (pivoting) between systems because of the persistent trust relationships created with SSH keys. And SSH-enabled pivoting can be the most damaging because SSH users and automated processes are typically granted elevated privileges. Many organizations leave themselves open to SSH-based pivoting because they have no inventory of deployed SSH keys that enable persistent access between systems.\n\nAfter attackers gain an initial entry into your network, their next goal is typically to get onto other systems, which is called lateral movement. When cybercriminals’ jump from system to system, they can easily pivot on your network by abusing persistent SSH trust relationships to their advantage. That’s especially the case if administrators don’t review those keys often or maintain strong oversight over them. When SSH machine identities fall into the wrong hands, this is very dangerous for your organization because SSH users and automated process are typically granted elevated privileges.\n\nWhile cybercriminals are busy moving laterally within your network, they could come across firewalls and other security technologies designed to block malicious network activity. Unfortunately, if you don’t properly control your SSH environment, attackers could bypass these safeguards by configuring SSH for port forwarding or other privileges. Doing so would allow the attackers to communicate with other systems that leverage authorized connections via firewalls and thereby find an alternate yet nonetheless “approved” route through the network.\n\nAttackers like to hide within the infrastructure by using readily available tools, like the SSH protocol, to redirect and exfiltrate data without being detected by traditional controls. SSH enables traffic redirects and allows its users to set up a listening port on a client and tunnel data through an encrypted channel to an exit server port or vice versa. As a result, encrypted SSH connections can also be abused by attackers to exfiltrate data without being detected.\n\nTo defend against the threats described above, it's imperative that organizations properly manage and configure their SSH environments. Policies and procedures play a critical role in SSH security by establishing consistent baseline requirements across the diverse systems and environments where SSH keys are deployed. Your policies should clearly spell out roles and responsibilities in order to prevent misunderstandings that result in security lapses and to ensure accountability. When you leave compliance in the hands of the various administrators who manage SSH keys for the systems they control, you’ll see inconsistent results for policy enforcement. That’s why it’s critical that you educate all SSH stakeholders on SSH security policies and processes—and have automation.\n\nThe best solution is to integrate a centralized platform like Venafi SSH Protect, offering full visibility of all machine identities across your entire enterprise. Enforce SSH key policies, discover and remediate policy violations or compromises, and more from a single dashboard."

        "document": "When it comes to securing Linux systems, Secure Shell (SSH) has been one of the most dependable tools at a sysadmin's disposal. However, with every technology solution, there are potential pitfalls that need to be carefully managed for security. In the case of SSH, key mismanagement can cause immediate risk of mass compromise.\n\nIn this article, we will discuss some of the primary risks related with SSH keys not only on Linux, but any system using SSH for remote access. Those risks are:\n\nSSH private keys are the crown jewels of remote access and a stolen key is a severe risk. Intruders can use stolen keys to impersonate users, access sensitive data, and take total control of a system. They also allow attackers to press lateral movement attacks and move onto other systems quickly and quietly.\n\nWe have seen many instances where poorly secured SSH keys can lead to compromise such as the following:\n• None Leakage from system automation tooling leaving them behind in exposed directories.\n\nThe biggest problem with stolen keys is that there is no evidence they've been stolen. Copying data is completely silent. The only indication most organizations may see are some unusual logins if they are paying attention. Even worse, as SSH keys have no expiration themselves, they can work for quite some time unless they are rotated frequently.\n\nCounteracting stolen keys is best handled by simply not using them. SSH key certificates are a superior solution as they can be set to have a short expiration time (e.g. a few minutes). A stolen certificate simply goes bad and won't work.\n\nIf you are using SSH keys (as most are), strategies such as periodic rotation and making sure they are securely handled is a must. If you can prevent personnel from handling them at all through the use of a credential vault this is even better. However, this level of care is difficult to manage in many organziations where keys hang around for many years. The best you can do is implement policies and measures to make sure keys are not allowed to exist beyond a certain age or move to SSH certificates (and here).\n\nFirst we'd recommend just looking on your systems for private keys hanging around where they shouldn't be. In particular, private keys in a user's home directory on a shared system is a major risk. If any account gets compromised, attackers will immediately search for private SSH keys lying about for all users.\n\nFinding private keys can be as simple as this script below. The keys may be encrypted, but still it would be worth asking if the user requires their private key to be on a system, especially if that system is shared with multiple users. Sandfly users can enable a policy scan that will check for private keys for all users automatically.\n\nMalicious SSH keys are inserted by adversaries to allow backdoor access. Logging onto a box over SSH by stuffing a new key into a user's authorized_keys file is simple and effective. Most users would never know a new key has shown up.\n\nThis script will locate any authorized_keys files modified in the past 24 hours, but it needs to be setup to run on all your systems. Other fleet management tools such as OSQuery can also be setup to search for recently modified files and should do so if you run it. Sandfly also has policy alerts that will sweep for this activity as well.\n\nIn whatever way you choose, monitoring for modified authorized_keys will find compromised credentials quickly that otherwise would go unnoticed.\n\nLook at this image below. It has a duplicate SSH key that will allow immediate login. How quickly can you spot it?\n\nActually in the image above, it has three duplicate keys. It's very difficult for a human to determine if a key has a duplicate by taking a quick look (let alone doing it across many systems and users).\n\nA duplicate SSH key present in authorized_keys is what happens when a key is present two or more times. What that means is if you delete a key with the intent of disallowing future logins, the unnoticed duplicates will still allow the key holder to login to the host.\n\nWe see a number of customers that have duplicate keys detected by Sandfly. It is very easy to have happen with just some of the mistakes below:\n• None User pastes in a key that is already present but they didn't know.\n• None A system automation tool managing key files makes an error and inserts a key one or more times.\n• None A backup is restored that has an old authorized_keys file with a duplicate key present.\n• None A piece of malware inserts a backdoor key one or more times because they are not checking if they have already dropped their key.\n\nDuplicate keys are a unique threat because unlike changing a password, removing a key may not prevent login if it still remains. Because of the difficulty in spotting this kind of situation it must be automated.\n\nSandfly looks for this activity by default, but this script will search for duplicate keys right now:\n\nOrphan keys are those that remain on a system after the corresponding user has been removed, or their access is no longer required. These keys offer a backdoor entry point if they get compromised. This risk can be mitigated by setting up proper key de-provisioning procedures and regular audits to clean up any orphan keys.\n\nIf you have used SSH authorized_keys for any period of time you likely have orphan keys right now. The only way to know is to manually review your authorized_keys files and remove keys you know are no longer needed. It will work better in most cases to simply get a list of keys you know should be allowed access as a user and wipe out the older authorized_keys file and start fresh.\n\nWhile looking at the timestamp on the authorized_keys file can show you the last time a key was added, it won't give you the dates of older keys so you cannot assign any time to when they first appeared. The only way to determine how long a key has been around is if you were tracking them centrally and can use the first time the key appeared as an anchor value across hosts (like Sandfly SSH Hunter does). File timestamps alone are not going to help you find older keys here.\n\nThis is a tedious task and is one of the biggest perils of authorized_keys for access management.\n\nUsers that have too many keys in the authorized_keys file are another potential attack vector. This causes a multitude of problems, the main one being that many people can log in as the same username and this makes auditing much harder. But also it leads to orphan keys (discussed above). Often nobody goes back to remove old keys and the list can grow and grow.\n\nWhat is an excessive number of keys? Well, we think one key for one user is the limit. But in reality it just depends on your organization. We have seen usernames with nearly a hundred keys that allowed people to login as them (e.g. git or root). We feel this is very likely to lead to compromise. We recommend to keep the keys each user allows for login as short as you can.\n\nThis script below will search all local users home directories for authorized_keys files that have 10 or more keys present as a starting point.\n\nA common mistake is not encrypting private keys. If private keys are not encrypted they can be easily abused if stolen. Keys should be encrypted at rest, and the storage medium (such as a filesystem) should be properly secured as well. The passphrase used to secure a key should be strong.\n\nYou may also want to increase the rounds used to check the passphrase to slow down brute force attempts (ssh-keygen -a flag) in case the key is stolen.\n\nIt's important to remember that passphrases are a stopgap measure. If an attacker has access to your system then you must assume they have stolen your passphrase with a keylogger or they can launch a brute force attack offline. However as an additional safety measure it does help to have them encrypted in case the keys are lost in other ways (such as stolen laptop, lost USB drive, etc.).\n\nThe use of SSH key options is another article in and of itself, but in general be wary of the following options and how they are being used. A full list of options is available in the man pages for OpenSSH, but these options in particular need to be closely watched:\n• None agent-forwarding - Can allow someone controlling the remote system to impersonate the user logging in and it should be configured correctly to be secure.\n• None command - Can allow someone to run commands as the user when they login with this key.\n• None environment - Can allow setting of environment variables for the user logging in with the key. This can cause security issues if the remote server allows them to be passed into the terminal session.\n• None port-forwarding - Can allow client system to forward ports bypassing firewalls and network controls.\n• None user-rc - Can allow system to run ~/.ssh/rc upon login to execute commands as the user.\n• None X11-forwarding - Permits X11 protocol to be forwarded over SSH, again bypassing firewall and network controls.\n\nYou can set the restrict option on all keys to automatically disable most of the above and other potentially risky options available in the future.\n\nThe script below searches for all of the above options in any authorized_keys file:\n\nOptions set can be innocent, but you should ensure they are what you expect and do not look suspicious.\n\nNo, that's not a typo. There is an SSH authorized_keys2 file that works like authorized_keys but is deprecated. If this file exists, it may still allow login on older servers. Its presence is almost always a malicious attempt to conceal access.\n\nIf you see this file in a user's home directory you should be asking some pointed questions. If the user doesn't know why the file is there then the system should be immediately investigated. Again on newer systems it may not work, but it's still worth investigating if it is present because someone put it there thinking it may work.\n\nThis script will locate authorized_keys2 files under any local user's directory:\n\nThe above scripts are available over at Github in a free open source repository. You can view and clone it below:\n\nThere are a myriad of ways that SSH keys can be abused and often using scripts or other tools to check for these problems is tedious and prone to miss serious risks. This is why we have Sandfly and our SSH Hunter.\n\nSSH Hunter will find the above attacks plus many others against your SSH infrastructure. Being able to monitor this critical asset agentlessly means you can get a handle on your SSH security immediately.\n\nSSH Hunter is available to all Sandfly users, even on the free tier. Get a license and try it today. If you want to see it in action you can watch the video below or contact us for a full demo.\n\nSSH is a massive step up in security over legacy protocols like Telnet. However, the management of SSH keys is notoriously difficult and open to theft. If your organization does not monitor SSH key usage, there is a high chance a compromise could happen at some point.\n\nWe strongly recommend monitoring SSH keys for abuse as it is a silent stalker for intruders wishing to get into Linux systems and remain undetected. Use the techniques listed above to check your systems, or try Sandfly to see how agentless Linux security can find SSH key problems in your enterprise."

Just the latest releases and tips, interesting articles, and rich materials in your inbox every month.\n• Traditional passwords create significant vulnerabilities, leaving organizations open to attacks. SSH keys provide a more secure and reliable alternative, reducing the risks of breaches.\n• Automating SSH key management helps eliminate human error, speeds up workflows, and strengthens overall security, making it a must-have for modern cybersecurity strategies.\n• SSH keys play a critical role in securing processes like remote server management, encrypted file transfers, and DevOps workflows, ensuring safe operations across your IT ecosystem.\n• Implementing proven security practices, such as key rotation and minimizing access privileges, can dramatically reduce risks and improve the safety of your systems.\n• Privileged Access Management (PAM) simplifies the complexities of SSH key management, offering centralized control, automated processes, and enhanced compliance for organizations.\n\nImagine finding out that a cybercriminal has been silently exploiting an unprotected SSH key in your system for 194 days before detection. That’s the average time it takes to identify a breach today, according to IBM. With data breaches costing businesses an average of $4.88 million in 2024, securing your systems has never been more urgent.\n\nSSH keys are one of the most powerful tools for protecting your organization against unauthorized access, but when left unmanaged, they can become liabilities.\n\nThis guide explores everything you need to know about SSH keys, from their importance to best practices, to keep your organization protected.\n\nWhat Are SSH Keys and Why Are They Important?\n\nSSH keys are digital authentication credentials that secure communication between systems.\n\nThey’re an integral part of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol, which encrypts data and replaces traditional password-based logins. SSH keys are widely used for secure remote administration, automated tasks, and encrypted data transfers.\n\nTheir role is essential in today’s cybersecurity landscape, where 1,636 cyberattacks occur weekly, representing a 30% year-over-year increase (Check Point Research, Q2 2024).\n• Regulatory Compliance: Industries regulated by standards like GDPR and PCI DSS require secure authentication methods, making SSH keys indispensable.\n\nWhen properly managed, SSH keys act as gatekeepers, allowing only authorized users and systems to access sensitive resources.\n\nWhile passwords are still widely used, they come with significant vulnerabilities that attackers are increasingly exploiting. 44% of users admit to reusing passwords across accounts (Keeper Security), making it easier for cybercriminals to gain unauthorized access.\n\nIn fact, breaches caused by compromised credentials have surged by 71% year-over-year (IBM), highlighting the urgent need for stronger authentication methods.\n\nSSH keys provide a more secure and reliable alternative to passwords. Here’s why they are rapidly becoming the preferred choice for organizations:\n• Eliminate Password Vulnerabilities: SSH keys use public/private key encryption, removing the need to transmit passwords over the network.\n• Mitigate Brute Force Attacks: Since attackers cannot guess a private key as they would a password, brute-force risks are significantly reduced.\n\nFor organizations managing sensitive data or operating within compliance-heavy industries, switching from passwords to SSH keys isn’t just a smart choice—it’s a necessity.\n\nSSH key authentication uses a public/private key pair to verify a user or system’s identity. The private key remains with the user, while the public key is shared with the target system. This setup removes the need to transmit passwords, significantly strengthening security.\n\nHere’s how it works step by step:\n• Key Exchange: The public key is installed on the target server, allowing authentication requests.\n• Secure Access: The server uses the public key to verify the private key, granting access to authenticated users.\n\nThis method protects against common attacks like credential phishing, which remains a leading cause of breaches.\n\nWhile SSH and SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) both use encryption, their use cases and functionality differ significantly.\n\nUnderstanding these differences allows you to apply the right protocol for your specific needs.\n\nEffective management of SSH keys is essential to prevent cyberattacks and maintain smooth operations. Poorly managed keys can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and compliance violations.\n• Perform a Comprehensive Key Audit: Identify all existing SSH keys in your environment. Many organizations have “shadow keys” that are undocumented and unmanaged, creating significant vulnerabilities.\n• Enforce the Principle of Least Privilege: Applying the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) limits access to only those systems and users that absolutely require it. This reduces the attack surface and aligns with modern security practices.\n• Automate Key Rotation: Manual key rotation is cumbersome and prone to errors. Automated solutions not only simplify the process but also keep keys updated, reducing the risk of compromise.\n• Monitor and Log Key Usage: Logging key usage provides critical insights into who is accessing what and when. This is vital for detecting suspicious behavior and meeting compliance requirements.\n• Avoid Embedded Keys: Never store SSH keys in application code or scripts. These keys are easily exploited by attackers and should be replaced with secure, centralized authentication methods.\n\nSSH keys are used in a variety of scenarios, making them indispensable for modern IT operations. Their applications include:\n• Automated Backups and File Transfers: Tools like Rsync and SCP use SSH keys for encrypted data transfers.\n• Tunneling and Port Forwarding: Establish secure connections for applications and databases.\n\nWith 32% of cyber incidents involving data theft and leakage (IBM), SSH keys play a critical role in safeguarding sensitive information during these operations.\n\nFailing to manage SSH keys effectively can have dire consequences. Cybercrime cost businesses $8 trillion globally in 2023, a figure expected to reach $24 trillion by 2027 (USAid).\n\nMismanaged SSH keys contribute to this figure by exposing organizations to data breaches, ransomware attacks, and compliance fines.\n\nPrivileged Access Management (PAM) solutions are designed to take the complexity out of SSH key management, addressing the challenges of manual processes that are time-consuming, error-prone, and increasingly unsustainable as organizations grow.\n\nWith PAM, you can automate critical tasks like key rotation, centralize control over key usage, and gain comprehensive visibility into who has access to what—streamlining management while improving security and compliance.\n\nComprehensive PAM solutions like senhasegura go even further by offering advanced tools to simplify and secure SSH key management:\n• Centralized Management: Store, track, and control all SSH keys from a unified platform.\n• Automated Key Rotation: Refresh keys regularly to align with security policies and regulatory requirements.\n• Full Visibility: Generate detailed reports on key usage to support audits and detect anomalies.\n\nWith cyberattacks happening every 39 seconds (University of Maryland), leveraging a PAM solution like senhasegura is a critical necessity for modern cybersecurity.\n\nSSH keys are essential for protecting your organization’s systems and data, but when they’re not managed properly, they can create serious vulnerabilities, compliance issues, and costly breaches.\n\nThis blog has shown why SSH keys are so important, the risks of leaving them unmanaged, and how Privileged Access Management (PAM) can make managing them simpler and safer.\n\nWith PAM, you get control, automation, and visibility all in one solution. It takes the stress out of SSH key management by bringing everything under one centralized platform, automating time-consuming tasks like key rotation, and giving you the tools to secure access across your systems.\n\nsenhasegura offers functionality that makes it possible to securely control the cycle of SSH keys through storage, rotation, and access control to protect these keys.\n\nIts benefits include blocking unauthorized access to privileged accounts through SSH keys, controlling and tracking their use, and managing trust relationships between keys and systems.\n\nIn practice, the solution centralizes the management of SSH keys, automatically rotating their pairs according to your company’s security policies.\n\nBelow, we summarize its main functions:\n• Organization of relationship of connections between servers\n• Reporting and access logs on the usage of these keys"
